No. I found two readily available parts that in combination should allow connecting luer lock infusion sets to a Tandem pump or a Tandem infusion set to a pump that uses luer lock connections. My main interest is the latter so I can extend the life of my Animas pump, which I use for backup.
I want to make it clear that I’ve located the parts, but haven’t yet ordered and tested them. I plan to do so within the next couple weeks and will report back.

I received the parts for connecting a Tandem infusion set to an Animas pump and connecting an Animas infusion set to a Tandem pump. I tested the first version over the last two weeks with success, and I’m testing the second one right now
The premise is cutting the T-Lock connector off the end of the of the the Tandem infusion set (Tandem infusion set to Animas pump) or the Tandem reservoir (Animas infusion set on Tandem pump). There are three parts involved with both. There is almost zero added volume in the connection (I couldn’t measure it) and all but one of the parts is reuseable.
I used the parts extensively during my career designing laboratory instruments. They’re from companies that manufacture parts for laboratory/medical  instruments and I can vouch for their quality.
@Robyn_H None of them are sterile when you buy them. @Robyn_H  Only two of the parts contact insulin. One is changed with each set, and the other is made from ETFE (Tezel) and should easily withstand soaking in rubbing alcohol. I suspect they would tolerate dilute bleach, but I haven’t tested them and don’t plan to do so.
These aren’t very attractive, but they do the job for me.
Here are a few photos -

These arrangements haven’t been endorsed or tested by the pump or infusion set manufacturers. I’m the only one who has (and is) testing them and I’m not a medical professional. I can’t verify or certify they will work for everyone or with different lots of infusion sets and cartridges. If you choose to use them DO SO WITH CAUTION!

Dawn phenomenon and feet on the floor are actually two seperate BG impacts.
DP occurs while you are still asleep around the early morning around 3-4am.  I’m actually not sure if you are awake during the time, whether it happens so sleep may have nothing to do with it but it happens during the dawn period.
FOTF happens when you are awake and set foot on the floor.  If you were awake and just lying in bed for an hour it doesn’t happen, the increase in BG only happens after you completely stand up.

Basically, the Dawn Phenomenon involves a ‘liver dump’ of glucose into the body as part of the process of preparing for the new day, along with other hormonal adjustments; FOTF involves a cortisol release based upon imminent activity upon waking up.  Cortisol is a ‘stress’ hormone so it means your body is getting ready for action.  Unfortunately, cortisol also sets up insulin resistance, hence the rise in BG values.

Some people will take issue with the idea of “forbidden treats” but I hear ya. My practice for a long long time was that it’s much easier for me to have an absolute ban on the things that are going to cause me trouble than to try to manage moderation. I learned this about myself when I quit smoking a million years ago. Had to be absolute cold turkey or it wasn’t gonna happen, so that’s what I did. Never had even a puff since the day I quit, back in the 80s. Which was when I was in my mid-20s, only a couple of years before I got T1, and it was kind of useful as I basically applied the same rule to The List of Stuff You Can’t Eat (which was what it was like back then). It’s easier (for me anyway) to enforce a blanket NO than to sometimes say yes and then have to deal with the craving for whatever it is.

Anyone experience Dexcom G5 giving numbers that are WAY off after restarting a sensor? I wore this sensor for 7 days, numbers were pretty good. This morning, I restarted the sensor after it expired, and the numbers are way off, like reading 3.9 while I’m 8.8. Calibrated a few times. Any advice for this situation?
I know I can just put in a new sensor, but I’m trying to make them last as long as possible because I pay out of pocket.

61,Makes No Sense,Type 1 and LADA,SherryAnn,11,"Sometimes diabetes just makes no sense, so the best one can do is to rely on experience or on help from others (like this wonderful Tudiabetes community), and to roll with the punches.  Last Friday, I changed my Pod. (I use the original OmniPod.)  As the evening wore on, I noticed higher-than-normal readings even though my dinner was not super carb-heavy and my activity remained the same.  I took the suggested bolus to bring my glucose reading down.  Two hours later, my G6 CGM alerted me to a high reading.  Again, I took the suggested bolus.  This pattern repeated all night and all though Saturday.  My diet and activity did not change from my normal routine, and I usually am within range most of the day.
My dad always told me to not waste my time being angry about a problem or looking for someone or something to blame.  Instead, I followed his advice and thought, “What can I DO to change this situation?”  The insulin in the bottle worked in the last Pod that I had used and was fairly fresh, so I rejected throwing out a perfectly good half-vial of insulin.  I could continue to bolus, but that was both annoying and unhealthy since my glucose continued to range in the high 200 - mid 300 range.  For some reason – location over scar tissue, a semi-plugged cannula, or a malfunctioning Pod? – the Pod just was not functioning the way it should have worked.  So off with the old Pod early and on with a new one.  I hated to waste the 40 units of insulin in the Pod, but I could not continue with having a non-functioning pump.  Within two hours of changing the new Pod to a new location, I was back in the 104 range.
The other Pod just did not work for whatever reason.  It made no sense, but that is a part of life with diabetes.  Sometimes it just does not make sense.  Those of you who have lived with this condition for years know what I am talking about.  Those of you who are new to diabetes, don’t be surprised when something seems wonky.  Sometimes it just is.  So don’t worry when senseless things happen. Don’t waste your energy by blaming yourself or anyone else.   Just move forward with asking for help if you need it or with using your experience to try something different.

 Dave44:

so many complaints about Omnipod failures, yet users generally will defend the product, which puzzles me.


Dave44, please don’t misunderstand me.  I have used the OmniPod for over a decade, and in that time I have had very few Pod failures.  Some were due to my own errors, but I would say that out of the last year – that is 120 Pods – I have had (maybe) one occlusion.  I love the OmniPod and will stay with it for as long as I can.  I suspect that this last “failure” was not due to the Pod as much as it was due to the location (which again was MY error). After 43 years of MDI, I have a LOT of scar tissue built up in my abdomen, and at 120 pounds, I do not have an excessively large area of abdomen tissue.  I suspect that I put the Pod in a “dead spot” as far as absorption is concerned. Other than an occasional occlusion, I have never really had a Pod itself fail.  My point was that no matter what the cause, the solution was to try a new Pod in a new place, and my solution worked.
As far as the “stash” goes, I am happy to have one.  First, I live half the year or more in Florida, and people down there always are warned to have a stash of everything medical in case a major storm comes through.  Hurricanes and even tropical storms can shut down pharmacies and delay shipments, so I feel more comfortable knowing I have plenty of supplies on hand in case my normal supply line gets disrupted.  Secondly, I now am on Medicare, and I know that sometimes supplies from Medicare also get delayed due to shipments getting caught in the “in process” paperwork purgatory.  Again, I have peace of mind knowing I am covered until necessary supplies come through.",Aug '19

For me, the best thing I did for myself was to stop using cannula sets.  they caused too much tissue trauma, not to mention the too-often dreaded “no delivery” issue.  All the hardened skin from my cannula-set days is a thing of the past.  I had so many infections the first few years of pumping with Sof Sets that I was convinced that they were not properly sterilized.  I tried wiping my skin with Hibiclens or Betadine prior to installing those sets but I still had terrible swelling, redness and sores that lasted long after the removal of the sets.  It was years before those problems abated for me and I don’t know to this day the source of the problem but I can tell you whatever it was it didn’t do my abdomen’s skin any good.   Using my current sets I get almost zero trauma and no longer see/feel any leathery tough skin.
I wish I could recall what specifically were the problems reported by Omnipod users but the thing that stuck out for me the most was the general failure RATE.

I’m a long time tubed pump user but also used the Omnipod system for several months. I did enjoy the non-tubed benefit but I’ve found managing the tube as an ingrained habit relatively easy.
I value good consistent absorption as my highest value. We’re all different, of course, but there are many who find the tube aspect as trivial. It would be nice if you could trial a pump for a few months before making a final commitment. Good luck with this!",Aug '19

Early on I popped off my share of pods, rounding a corner.  Not to jinx myself, but that hasn’t happened in years now!  I’ve had multiple pod failures.  And, I’ve experienced my fair share (and then some) of what is called tunneling; I didn’t know why my pod was bloody and wet when I removed it - or connect the fact that that was why I was running high.  For as smart as I believe I am, in this instance (and a few other D-related instances/minutes/hours/days/weeks/months/years/…) I’ve been pretty ignorant.  I’m so glad for this and other DOCs!  I have learned so much!
I’ve been running my stash down because I don’t know in which direction I want to go.  Keep the pre-Dash OmniPod; go to Dash OmniPod; go to a tubed pump; or to Loop and if so, with which pump; or go to MDI.  As it is, the only way I have been able to keep tunneling from happening, is to move off of my belly (way too much scar tissue) and to not bolus, but only use the pod for basal.  I only bolus from a needle and syringe now - I think this is about a year or longer I’ve been doing it this way.  Now I’m reading in the DOC about how the canula is to blame for scar tissue and tunneling and that I might have better luck with a steel needle instead.

Because a pod incorporates both the infusion set and part of the pump mechanism, it’s easier for pod users to call any problem a “pod failure,” including discomfort, leaking, bleeding, infection, and even knocking a pod off by accident. People who use tubed pumps, where we can clearly separate “infusion set” and “pump hardware,” would never call any of these things a “pump failure.” So it may well seem that “pod failure” complaints (which include site and infusion problems) are far more common than “pump failure” complaints (which refer to the pump mechanism only).",Aug '19

The standard test to differentiate between Type 1 and Type 2 is the (proper) glucose tolerance. The test must measure both sugar and insulin level. If the insulin level is 0, obviously Type 1. If sugar level and insulin level both rise sharply, then Type 2. For someone first put on insulin and then given a glucose tolerance test, the insulin level will be a straight line for Type 1 and will go up for Type 2 (but the glucose tolerance test should have been done before insulin was prescribed). If one suspects a false diagnosis of Type 1 and prescribed insulin, the proper test is creatinine, which is a byproduct of insulin production and will be 0 for a Type 1 even if taking insulin, and normal for anyone who is not Type 1.
Some doctors (we had one in my home town) order a faux glucose tolerance test for those who come in with fasting sugars of 70 mg/dl = 4 mmol/l. A large quantity of glucose is given, and if sugar goes up, Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed; if sugar does not go up, hypoglycaemia is diagnosed, so all those tested need extensive and expensive medical care.
A normal physician, if one has a fasting blood sugar less than 126 mg/dl = 7 mmol/l, says one does not have diabetes and lets it go at that. A very few persons do have normal fasting sugars but postprandial sugars above 200 mg/dl = 11 mmol/l and are technically diabetic, but this is very rare, and physicians not trying to maximise revenue  do not do the faux glucose tolerance test that does not measure insulin levels.
(It is also not clear what it means if someone has sugars that rise to 200/11 after a meal then quickly drop below 126/7, or if this really requires treatment; strictly speaking, blood glucose is now an obsolete test for diabetes–though still commonly used–HbA1c should be used as the definitive test for diabetes.)",8d

Are you using CGM?  I know many parents of kids with T1D like the Sugarmate app, and many options for logging.  I don’t use it, but others here may have more comments.

(But I did hear a success story about it: a young adult never checked her sugar, ate large meals without taking any insulin, and was careful never to go near an ophthalmologist for a retina scan, and when she got switched to CGM, she now has her sugar levels forced upon her and when her sugar goes too high, she takes insulin and when it gets low, eats something. But I do that by using 6 or 8 tests a day.)",5d

They had a Smart version of the One Touch, the One Touch II, and the One Touch Ultra, but not any of the later meters. I got a 2nd One Touch Ultra Smart and started in 2001 (I didn’t care about the days of the week), but the One Touch SAYS you can choose between mg/dl and mmol/L, but you cannot. My old meter is mg/dl, and if I set it to mmol/L, it remains mg/dl. My new meter was for Canada, so it came set for mmol/L. I can use the menu to set it to mg/dl as many times as I like, but it remains mmol/l, and I find it annoying to have to multiply by 18.",5d

111,Working,Type 1 and LADA,mohe0001,2,"Me and James have been talking in another post. I think that fundamentally, the issue is this…
I think that needing to work for someone I trust has a LOT to do with being diabetic.
I wonder if you guys feel this way and how that plays out.
I wonder if this is just a quirky mohe-thing, or if this is a factor for other diabetics.
I suspect/know that this IS an issue for a much larger proportion of the population now with covid at play. I think I see these issues playing out with a lot more prominence since covid started.
For me, initially, I just got lucky and worked for a lot of really trust worthy, collaborative people in small, family run restaurants.
Then, as an EMT, I refused to work with people I didn’t trust because I didn’t want to do harm to other people (people like me, who were patients). I would only work with people who I felt had really, really good intentions (and, honestly, this kept me out of all sorts of trouble). I was trained for that stuff at a really young age and indoctrinated really heavily with healthcare morals. I took that stuff really seriously because of my experience with diabetes.
But, I think that a lot of that stuff also gets intertwined with my own personal safety and feeling safe. I fundamentally, didn’t want to work with people who I didn’t trust to provide me with care. The practical reality of that is that sometimes I have diabetes issues and sometimes I have epilepsy issues. I’ve seen people get hurt at work (sometimes REALLY badly) and have their employer prevent ambulance response because they dont want to get a workman’s comp claim. Things like that have happened to me, personally.
It’s a self reinforcing thing.
It extends to the professional workplace. We see employers, now, who aren’t real good people, placing employees under undue risk, for sometimes only very minor benefit. So, I think these concerns escalate & reinforce now. I can tell really quickly who I can trust and who I can’t. Working with people who I can’t trust probably produces an unusually high stress response. But, I almost never do it, so that is kinda why I’m asking the rest of you about this.
I am definitely selective about who I will work with. The economy is bad. When that happens, you can’t afford to be super selective. Maybe I am being too selective. But, I feel like when I work for a bunch of thugs and criminals (who totally exist in professional environments) and/or people who I don’t trust to have good judgement or good character in an emergency, there are always problems - nothing but constant problems.
Working with good people that you trust, UNDENIABLY keeps you out of court.
It helps keep you physically safe.
It prevents people from taking advantage of you
It prevents association with people who would put you in harms way.
It solves so many problems upfront.
You guys help reinforce ideas like this. For instance, my fear of MT & UHG. I know that this community does not judge those companies to be ‘good’ organizations. I feel the same way. It translates into physical fear of working for them…which I believe is totally justified.
I think this internet site is FULL of good people. That’s why I hang around. But, I know that not all of you work in fantastic environments - that’s not possible, statistically.",29d

I believe a good medium term goal (5-10 years) for anybody starting a new career job is to eventually end up in a small business. The trust relationship, control over your own destiny, etc. are all better in the right small business. You are basically working side by side with the owner every day. Many small businesses are “niche” providers that are by necessity very intent on training you to provide good value to the customer. Some people who share my beliefs start at a big corporation or institution, learn everything they need to know about the industry and then they split for a small business.
That said, of course there are small businesses that will screw the employees. You have to make good choices about who to trust when/if you join one.
I might be biased (I’ve always rankled under “higher authority” such as corporate offices, etc.) but I think many large corps and institutional employers treat you like a number on a spreadsheet and nothing more until you move up the ranks pretty far. The best way to survive starting at a large corp or institution is developing a good trusting relationship with your direct supervisor. That person is the go between helping you navigate all the roadblocks the bean counters might throw at you. And hope/pray you can trust that person to handle things properly.",28d

Thanks for the input. I’ve felt a little discouraged since last week’s interview with a small company. I felt a stronger obligation/responsibility to very open/honest with them because they were small. It really hurt me to tell them that I couldn’t work for them, but they were very unconventional because they wanted people on-site. I just had to tell them, upfront, that I wasn’t gonna do that.

Small businesses, being more intimate, can present a problem, if one does not want to have a close relationship with peers and managers, and would rather have independence, say when designing applications.

I spent some time in senior management of a national engineering services corp. and I was appalled at the bean counter attitude towards technical people who bring value but do not directly bring in customers.

117,Working,Type 1 and LADA,Robyn_H,2,"I’m a small company girl, and it has completely soured me against the big companies.  Not in terms of working for them, as I’m not employed anymore, but just a complete distaste for big business in general.  I was so happy to escape the city and all the business drama to be an isolated little homesteader.
I started off being just a namesake for the small business I built my career with.  They were a company that provided both medical and cosmetic laser procedures.   Every different classification of laser comes with various operation requirements.  These particular lasers required that someone of my background be associated with the company, but not necessarily on the premises.
Eventually I came to be very “hands on” in the business, because I found it much more interesting than I first thought it would be.  I was fascinated by the medical exploits of LIGHT.  The fact that we have chromocytes that respond to specific colors of life, and how Noiger frequencies unlock certain healing properties of light.  As a company providing services for payment, though, we constantly fought with the fact that the treatments weren’t very impressive.  It was truly amazing what could be done with the lasers, but they were so weak and covered such a small area that it took a long time, and a LOT of money, to achieve the desired results.  There were many angry customers.  We kept saying, “we can do this better…”
And so we started experimenting, building makeshift equipment out of the garage.  The owner of the company had the capital, I had the science background, and we brought a nasa engineer in on the building.  What we were able to achieve out of a garage blew our big company competition out of the water.
We decided to focus first on getting cosmetic FDA approval, because it was the least expensive and easiest way into the market.  We were taken completely off guard when our assigned FDA liaisons showed up at the door unannounced, looking very “Men in Black”.
The entire purpose of this visit was to surmise if we wanted to “play with the big dogs”, exact words that were put to us.  It was literally about buying lobbying power, and it determined the track our submission would take.  We were proposing a device that was in direct competition with Erchonia, a massive scale medical device manufacturer, even though we were only working it from the less-stringent cosmetic angle.  We opted to be a “little dog” the first round, and we were fast-tracked for approval following a “grandfather” rule that our photonics had already been proven safe.
And then the Erchonia nightmare began… People don’t understand the language used in reference to anything related to the FDA, and they don’t know what recalls mean and how they work.  Basically, with the billions Erchonia had paid into the FDA, they had the lobbying power to demand recalls be issued on our device with no evidence of wrong-doing whatsoever.  A recall does not necessarily mean anything has been determined unsafe, and doesn’t even mean you have to stop using the recalled devices (in most cases).  The most substantial recall issued was in regards to a typo in the user manual, which meant we had to pay again for the manual to be approved.  The FDA issues recalls first, and lets you defend yourself after the fact.  Erchonia was relentless with the recalls, trying to bankrupt their competition in court and re-filings.  They also started a smear campaign against us, advertising our recalls, knowing how bad it made us look despite there being not a single thing substantial about them.  We’re talking light here, the thing that surrounds us all the time…
Thankfully, we impressed enough people with our product and were diligent enough in the patent department that we were able to gather enough investors to file as a medical device as a “big dog”.  The whole process was ridiculous.  Some things I expected, like surgical procedures to document internal effects, but other things were absurd.  They charged us ludicrous amounts to drop our device from planes (newsflash, there isn’t a medical device on the market that will survive a 35,000 foot drop undamaged…), and rent the most powerful Tesla coil facility in the country to electrocute it. The fact devices can’t survive these stressors doesn’t mean  to the final ruling, either.  It was all just as a farce to buy us equal footing to fight Erchonia.  And none of it stopped the recall damages.  All it essentially meant was that we could issue our own recalls against them.
None of this FDA battle was about providing effective and safe devices.  NONE of it.  It was literally just about doing dirty business and greasing palms.  It’s left me forever poisoned against big medical companies.  I see it everywhere now.  The big company mentality about not growing, not changing, not providing the best experience for their user, but just protecting their investors and their hold on the marketplace.  I see that stink all over Medtronic.  It’s why I’m such staunch supporter of Tandem and the other upstarts that are honestly just fighting to bring a better product to the market.
If I had to go back to the job place, I just couldn’t do it.  I couldn’t go to work for one of those big companies I hold so much vehemence for.  I need to see the intrinsic value a company brings to their market, and that doesn’t have a thing to do with shareholders.  I need to see the company takes care of and protects their employees, hair employees turn out better work.  Most importantly, though, I know I wouldn’t be appreciated by a large company.  Large companies need mindless worker drones that do as they’re told and don’t make a stir.  I’m not that person.  I want to be someone who can influence positive change to a product or even the process.  I don’t do well with “shut up and just do the job we pay you to do”.",28d

Eventually I stopped the therapy to take a break but I have to tell you the pain is not gone.   I still have that weird pain in my back and pain around my ribs and when I eat- it feels very bloated and uncomfortable. And like when I had the pneumonia it gets worse when my blood sugar goes low. I have to eat more and drink  juice and I am gaining weight from it even though it is not really that much more than what I usually eat.
I mean with the diabetes and everything I barely eat compared to the past, but I guess the insulin makes me gain weight. I am using a lot more basal the past year or so just to control blood sugar in the normal range.
Maybe it is also my thyroid I may need to adjust the medication I have not had a blood test for a while because I forgot to make the next appointment at my endo last time,  I usually get tested every three months or so. And with a spike in Covid in my area I do not want to go to a lot of appointments so I hope I can do the visit virtually and just go to the lab to get the blood work.
I have to talk to my gp and ask her what is going on. My lungs are still not back to normal- if I get near any type of dust or anything I start coughing right away and I have to use my inhalers a lot more than before the Covid. I feel like I am trying to take a deep breath a lot of the time and I can’t get that last breath of air in deep in my lungs. I have coughing asthma so I often have the feeling,  it is  a lot worse since the pneumonia/Covid.
I have been too exhausted dealing with everything else to talk to my doctor about all of this yet, I plan ask her about maybe going to an infectious disease specialist due to the reactivation of EBV which she had suggested when I told her about the test results.

I do a fingerstick halfway through the restart so I dose if need be, because I really try to be around 100 mg/dl when the first data point comes in.

Give it 15 minutes or so between calibrations.
You’ll get a feel for what’s acceptable when it gives you calibration errors.

Do you remove transmitter ? How long do you wait?  At least 20 minutes works for me.  Maybe try waiting a bit longer.

I think I may have succeeded now after checking on Dexcom users site on Reddit. A user there advised prying up on the wire to separate it a little from the surrounding tissue such that the transmitter senses a change in surrounding tissue prior to reinserting transmitter. Only 1hour remaining now in warmup, so think it may work. Maybe I’ll try using the receiver next time as you suggest, cause trying to lift out the wire just a little presents some risk of not being able to get it well seated again and may increase infection risk too, I guess.",16d

150,Accuracy after g6 restart,Type 1 and LADA,Robyn_H,1,"You shouldn’t have to pry the wire. I’m guessing you just missed a step or misunderstood something about the timing.
Are you stopping the sensor on all connected devices? The timer can’t start until everything connected to the transmitter stop talking to it, AND the transmitter has been removed from the sensor.  If you only stop it on one device (say pump or receiver) it can take up to two minutes for the cell phone to receive the stop message, and it’s still gathering data.
I stop the sensor on my phone and pump.  Pop out the transmitter.  Clean the contacts with an alcohol wipe (pads the timer by ten seconds or so).  Then start a 15 minute timer.  Never had a failed restart.",15d

The key points to discuss would be how your BGs are responding to your meds and other changes you made (food choices, quantity, exercise, etc).
Your doctor may do an in-office A1C that may help show progress, depending on how long ago you were diagnosed.
How long has it been since diagnosis?

155,First PCP visit After Diagnosis,Type 2,Zwired1,,"Personally, I found a CGM very helpful as there is, in my opinion, way too much to keep track of and try to figure out, particularly when you’re new.  I went about 6 months using finger sticks before I asked for a CGM (it was not offered or even discussed by the GP) and have been on one for about a year and a half.  Without it, there’s too much opportunity to dismiss a high or low as an effect of when you poked your finger relative to a meal, etc. and it’s nearly impossible to accurately see effects of different meals or exercise on a several-hour timeframe.  Let alone see nighttime trends.
Again, personally and without a lot of experience to back it up, I would push for a monitor with high/low alarms while they are adjusting your med list and doses.
My doctor focused on the meds and did not consider other things that I changed in my life.  If you’ve reacted to the diagnosis like a lot of people and overcompensated in the exercise direction, diet changes, etc. make sure the doctor understands and factors that into the med adjustments.  Particularly if you think your changes are not sustainable – they’re trying to adjust things with medications while you’re adjusting them with diet and exercise and unless people talk it will delay you getting to a happy/healthy steady state.

When I was diagnosed at the age of thirteen I said If anyone had to be a diabetic, it might as well be me, since I was not bothered by needles and wasn’t especially fond of most sweets. As the years wore on, my good attitude did not last. The sheer nuisance if it all took a toll, and then the expense and the complications that resulted from the inability to afford proper care kicked in. But I digress . . . I finally reached Medicare age and got back on a pump, so things are looking up, though my Pollyanna days are long gone. Anyway, inserting it “manually” won’t bother me at all. You are so smart!

The issue is that the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), has given preliminary advice that those of us who use immuno suppressants should wait until time for our immuno suppressant  have the vaccine, then wait for one full period before we have the immuno suppressant.
I take Rituxan twice each 4 months.  Meaning I would have the second dose of Rituxan then wait 4 months, have the vaccine, then wait 4 months.
So wait about eight months to have the Rituxan.  It is a terrible choice.  Go back to barley walking and being awake or get the vaccine.  Since i would also have to be off Methotrexate for one month the outcome could be awful.
ACR has yet to release final advice to rheumatologists so hopefully Rituxan might be treated differently in the final advice, but right now, as much I want it, if what preliminary advice is correct and i do not wait.  The vaccine will be wasted.  The patient (me of course) will be fine, it is the vaccine that will be wasted.

I looked through Pfizer’s article, and while they don’t say if the people with diabetes in the trial had type 1 or 2, there were 118 people in the trial (62 received the real vaccine) with rheumatic diseases- most of which are autoimmune diseases. There were 100 people with diabetes that had complications and 1,473 people with diabetes without complications that received the real vaccine. These counts are in the supplementary appendix in the link below.
62 is a small number. Still, seeing the large number of people with diabetes and seeing that some trial participants had autoimmune diseases gave me some comfort that the trials had included people with a similar background to me, if not the same background.

239,Help! I MAY have doubled up on my long acting!,Type 1 and LADA,Shead,,"Help! I got completely sidetracked this morning. I typically take 29 units of Levemir in the morning and 7 units at bedtime. This morning I administered my morning dose and immediately thought, “did I already do this?” I cannot for the life of me remember if I already gave it. So, I definitely have my usual 29 units in but I may have an additional 29. I took in 44g of fast acting carbs about an hour after just because I had given myself my fast acting previously bc I was about to eat so I was naturally dropping. I spiked to over 400 which is a new record for me. I’ve been sitting in the 200’s since then and haven’t eaten since. I’m almost 8 hours in from when I know I injected so I think I’m about where the insulin would peak. Surely by now I would have had some lows related to if I did actually give an additional 29 units, right? Just trying to decide if I’m in the clear and can correct and eat! Thoughts?",8d
240,Help! I MAY have doubled up on my long acting!,Type 1 and LADA,Robyn_H,2,"The only real problem you ran into is the 55g carb correction.  Levemir is a slow acting.  You had eight hours to basically correct for half you dose (the other half gets used even more slowly over the next 16ish hours), but you had all the correction in your blood stream by the 1:15 hour mark.  So yep, I would definitely correct.
Basically, overdosing on Levemir isn’t as scary as it would be to overdose on short-acting.  You just have to be aware and vigilant.  You’re right to be worried around the 8 hour mark, because that’s when you’ll be most likely to have a big hypo if it’s going to happen, but it won’t come on terribly fast.  You’ll have plenty of time to treat it.
Next time you suspect you may have doubled up, don’t panic. You can wait if out to see if you’re even trending lower than normal.  If you are, rather than treat with fast acting carb you want to try and delay digestion with protein and fat.  Crackers with cheese and/or peanut butter would be great.  This would also be an excellent day for those notoriously difficult foods to bolus for.  You just built an extended bolus into your day (at that 8 hour mark) for pizza or Chinese food.
Personal choice, but I might knock a unit or 2 off that 7-unit dose, too, since you might still have insulin working from the double up.  You’ll have to decide before then if you think you did actually get the double up or not.  If you’ve got CGM, I wouldn’t bother reducing the second injection, as the CGM will alert you to too much insulin.  If not, I would reduce, because if be afraid to sleep through the night with possible extra insulin on board.
I think we’ve all been there before. I did it once my senior year of highschool with R/NPH, which unfortunately turned out to be brutal.  I was sooooooo excited about going to Cedar Point with my boyfriend that day, and forgot I already took it.  Wound up spending most of the day in their infirmary, fighting not to be taken to the hospital, because no amount of dextrose gel or glucose tabs would keep me up.  That was the day I learned french fries are a magic cure.  As a last ditch effort, someone brought me fries from the stand outside and it was the first thing that finally got my blood sugar up and kept it up!

I did this with long acting and short acting once, I mixed them up as I recall. I was ok, I drank oj and  when it started to drop I added more carbs then walked when it spiked a bit. This was one of the reasons I switched to a pump. The main one was terrible control and fluctuations on unstable basal as well as bad lows with long acting.

I know exactly what is going on just by the sound.  If my phone sings “sugar, sugar” to me, I know I need sugar.  If it sings Chris Isaak’s “baby did a bad, bad thing”, then I either forgot to bolus or over-indulged.  I’ve got another very non-intrusive alert (I picked it just because it’s a rising tone, but my husband thinks it sounds like the Jetsons theme song), that’s set at 135, just so I can double-check the amount of IOB is enough.  I can also change them at night, so I only get woken up if I actually need to act. Dexcom does NOT give you that freedom.  You just set high and low limits.
Xdrip let’s you put your reading in the notification bar constantly.  You can always see it hovering at the top of your phone, not just when you’re on the homescreen.
Xdrip let’s you customize your display colors and fonts, even on the widget.  Might not be important to some, but I like having it not-ugly.
You can log other data into Xdrip easily, fingersticks, carbs, medications, notes, etcs…
Xdrip gives you better statistical data, in more formats to help you process it.
If you set up the feature, Xdrip can recommend needed grams of carbohydrate or units of insulin to correct.  Dexcom can’t.
Xdrip doesn’t share data with Dexcom in any way,  unless you choose to link Dexcom follow or clarity into it, so they can’t try to track/outsmart sensor restarts.
The only downside I’ve found to Xdrip is that later versions of Android with beefy security really don’t like apps running all the time.  I think OEM Medical apps are able get some sort of security certificate that let’s them run with less bother.  My phone likes to put Xdrip to sleep at night when I am, and the phone has been idle, no matter how many settings and permissions I adjust.  Sometimes it will stop receiving data and when I wake up, it will say “signal missed 5 hours ago…”, Or something similar.  I have to go into the “system status” page, and tell it to “forget device”, then “restart collector” to wake it back up.  Rarely, that doesn’t even work, and then I have to restart the phone.

Even then, almost any 3rd party app or set of apps, have little value for me.
I care about my short-term and long-term values, average A1c, notification for lows and very lows, and charting so I can understand problem areas and patterns. I can get that from the Dexcom apps. A deeper analysis does not appeal to me, nor do customized ringtones, at least beyond what the Dexcom offers.
Additionally, my data can be read by my endocrinologist and her team, without me having to upload the data. Once I set the office up in the Clarity app, it is seamless. From what I’ve read, other systems require manual download/uploads, and sometimes clearing IT administration hurdles.",Jul '20

The features of the app are so extensive, it will do most anything you want. And now that I am familiar with it, the user interface works fine for me.
In particular, I really like the predictive low alarm, which works better than the alternatives and was available years before the alternatives. In addition, I get far fewer nuisance alarms. For example, you can program xDrip to disable any high or low BG alarm when you BG is headed back to normal values.
You actually can compare the two apps side by side. Although you can only connect the G6 to one smart device at a time, xDrip will let you use ‘Dexcom Share/Follow’ as a BG source. Thus, you can setup the Dexcom app with sharing enabled and configure xDrip to “Follow.” The xDrip readings will show up a few seconds later than they would otherwise, but it does work and is a viable way to get a direct real time comparison (when done, ditch the Dexcom app and pair xDrip to the G6 via Bluetooth).",Aug '20

Without a doubt sick day management  and especially avoiding DKA is going to be super hard for any T1 that ends up getting Covid-19.
I tried to relay to my endo, how hard it was for me 30+ years ago when I as a college-age T1 got Chicken Pox. I guess I had just been lucky in my younger years to have not gotten it - I wasn’t the world’s most social kid which is probably how I avoided it for so long… That illness which is minor for young kids, SERIOUSLY had me out of commission for a whole week and somehow I muddled through with massively increased insulin doses but still also having high bg’s the whole time. If I had fallen asleep for 24 hours though, there wasn’t anyone who could’ve helped me with the inevitable DKA (my longest acting insulin at the time was NPH which was maybe good for 12 hours).

I know us type 1’s though can become pretty uncontrolled quickly when sick, it’s hard to want to pump enough insulin to keep those numbers down when normally those doses would crash you big time. And then you have to keep doing it and worry about crashing. Thank goodness for my Dexcom.

317,Glimpse the future,Diabetes Technology,Terry4,12,"With the appearance of continuous glucose monitors (CGM), like the Dexcom G6 that don’t require daily fingerstick calibrations, many people have fallen out of the habit of using a fingerstick meter to manage their glucose levels. I’m testing a lot less frequently than I used to but there are situations where a confirming fingerstick saves me a lot more trouble than it creates.
I’ve been struggling some with a trend of lows around midnight, a few hours after I go to bed. These lows often require more than one glucose treatment. I think they are caused by basal rates set too high, something I now call a “basal low.” We all know the feeling of just wanting to handle this situation quickly so that we don’t fully wake up and then face trouble getting back to sleep.
Making the effort to do a fingerprick is the last thing you want to do. I often just eat a glucose tab and roll over. Unfortunately, these lows have been more persistent and 15 minutes later, the alarm is sounding again. I’ve learned from experience that I can cycle through the alarm, treat and another alarm cycle until I treat one too many times and my blood sugar goes high for the rest of the night.
Two nights ago, I was woken up with a low alarm (65 mg/dL), treated with one glucose tab and rolled over. Fifteen minutes later the urgent low 55 mg/dL alarm sounds. I then thought, ok, maybe I am indeed low and need another glucose tab or perhaps my first treatment just hasn’t metabolically registered yet.
Reluctantly, I dragged myself out of bed and stuck my finger – 90 mg/dL. So my suspicion was confirmed, I returned to bed without another glucose tab, no more alarms and I woke up in the morning at 93 mg/dL. I would have been so easy to eat another glucose tab (or two!) and return to sleep and bounce into hyperglycemia for the rest of the night.
In these situations, I think of a fingerstick as a way to look 15 minutes into the future. It’s not really the future but a CGM often lags a meter by 15 minutes.
I find this framing makes it easier for me to find the energy to do the fingerstick and make better informed decisions. Instead of feeling like I’m burdened with this additional task, I see it as an opportunity to see into the future and make a better call.
As humans, we have this incredible ability to reframe reality and instead of changing any of the facts in a situation, we can see it from a different perspective and make better decisions.
It’s a small thing that has helped me. I now see my fingerstick meter as a magical tool at times that can allow me to see 15 minutes into the future. It makes those difficult midnight decisions a little easier. Anyone else use this technique?",Jul '20

I can see my interruption of sleep example is a tough sell for most people; we all love our sleep and certainly need it for our health.
The larger point, however, still applies. As many of us have easily transitioned to using a CGM and accepting its values for moment-to-moment treatment decisions, if we’re going to add food, insulin, or even exercise in response to a CGM value, looking 15 minutes into the future with a fingerstick before acting can be time well spent.",Jul '20

I’ll be switching here soon from the G5 to the G6 and I have plenty of strips, but I don’t think they will be covered any longer once I do make the switch.


I ordered and received 3 new G5 Transmitters the end of June and have enough sensors to last until the transmitters die (3-6 months depending on the batteries). I’m in the camp of not wanting to change to G6 because of cost if for no other reason.

Meanwhile, I finger test regularly, because like others I can’t see 15-20 minutes into the future. 41 tests the past 7 days (6 per day). At least half of these are within an hour of getting up as I battle a changing dawn phenomenon each day.",Jul '20

 Marilyn6:

I am not sure why my ratio has changed so much.


I think you can just attribute this to the nature of diabetes. My recent dive in BGs around midnight seemed to come out of nowhere and I’m still trying to figure it out. I think the important thing is to accept any new trends quickly and experiment with tactics to address it.
The simple analysis for lows is that we are getting too much insulin. The harder job is to try to figure out how much to reduce and when. That includes deciding how much to take off of the basal insulin and how much the bolus dose.
In my case, I’m getting a build-up of insulin on board during the pre-bedtime hours and I think that leads to a hypo-effect around midnight. I am going to make my evening meal (which I eat at least three hours before retiring) insulin dose more aggressive. I can’t believe that I’ve been working on this for a few weeks now. It seems like a relatively simple challenge but the solution has been evading me. I will persist!



 Tapestry:

How many blood tests (finger sticks) do you think you’ve done since you made the switch from G4 to G6?


My fingerstick rate of testing has remained unchanged during the G4 to G6 transition, about five tests average per day. Some days I don’t poke at all and other days might mean 10 checks. In order to feed BG data to Loop during the two-hour sensor warm-up period, I stick every 20 minutes. I also add meter checks when I know my sensor diverges from my actual BGs. I don’t think skimping on test strips for economic reasons is a good idea, but I think insurance companies ceasing strip coverage is reprehensible.
While I disagree that payors stop coverage due to paying for CGMs that do not require calibration, I will self-fund if need be. Strips can be purchased for about 20 cents each and I think $1/day for five strips is worth it for safety and health. I still get strip coverage under my Medicare Part D coverage; I think the Part B coverage has dried up for most people who use a no-calibration-required CGM like the G6.



 Jim_in_Calgary:

I’m in the camp of not wanting to change to G6 because of cost if for no other reason.


I’d still be using the G4 if Dexcom didn’t cut me off from the data stream needed to run Loop. I know I could have changed to the G5 but sense that I won’t be too long until that option expires. Canada, of course, will operate with a different schedule.

You and me, both. This morning I had to throw two 4-unit Afrezza doses at a stubborn glucose level and finally was able to bring it down with a 15-minute rebounder session.  Keep up the good fight, @Jim_in_Calgary!",Jul '20
329,Glimpse the future,Diabetes Technology,Marilyn6,4,"I think my insulin/carb ratio improvement is most likely because I am starting my fourth year of following a plant based very low fat diet which is designed to lower insulin resistance. I can now eat more than 10 times the amount of carbs using the same amount of insulin as I did when eating 30 carbs daily.
I am also exercising after both breakfast and lunch. Instead of 1 hr after breakfast I am splitting the time. I think that is the biggest recent change I have made. I should probably lower my basal insulin, since I am running lower at night and waking up with a glucose level in the 60’s.  I had no alarm go off last night and was able to sleep all night without waking.
I find eating the same amount of oatmeal and fruit every morning, and beans, quinoa, kale and a garbanzo bean cookie at lunch makes it so I don’t have to guess about my glucose levels. Dinner is the only meal I vary.

I have glucose by the bed so, same as you I take a correction then roll over only to be woken up again. My meter, that I still use because for another week I am on the G5, is downstairs so like you I have not wanted to bother.
I determined that my basal doses (twice daily) were too high so I have been gradually decreasing and then checking before bed. I have found, at least with my G5 experience, that sometimes the sensor goes off on a tangent and does not at all reflect reality so I have learned to check with a finger stick occasionally especially when my body sense does not match the sensor reading.
When I was relying on finger sticks only I kept a meter by the bed as well but with the CGM the strips might go beyond their usefulness if I am only using them on occasion instead of 10+ times a day. My wonder is, why? I eat a modified keto diet, am a habitual intermittent faster and snack only to keep from going low if I am. I had wondered if, with the immune strengthening regime I do, that maybe my reluctant pancreas is helping out again, albeit slowly.

Once calibrated, the Dexcom either falls in line for the rest of the 10 days, or slowly drifts back up after a few days.
I am reminded of the study that someone mentioned here a while back (can’t remember who) where it was found that your A1c result is skewed by how well your hemoglobin fuses sugar to itself.

Second, it’s hard to guess what is going on without more details, so some thoughts, likely terrible, but I’m willing to try…


Sure, not eating makes moods worse. Here, I’m thinking of court judgments that get progressively worse up until lunch, and once fed, judges are nicer. On the flip side, low blood sugar leads to weakness and dizziness, so for me a disinclination to fight, although I have seen anger associated with high blood sugar.


My spouse used to repeatedly ask me if I had checked my blood sugar, part of her anxious disposition. My mother, after my father died, under a lot of pressure, repeatedly attacked me, and it went on for years, giving me an attitude of ‘leave me alone’. With my spouse, once I decided to just test when she asked, she behaved better, my A1c got better, and over time I was able to lessen her inappropriate requests, taking time to educate her about the correct and/or suggested timing.


I don’t know your relationship, so pardon if this is way off base, but depending on how you verbally approach your partner, it might set him off, if it put him in a position where he felt weak, triggering defensiveness. or in my case if he came from a family where he was often attacked. Attempts at sympathy or concern can easily backfire unless you know that he is fine otherwise.


Question, how is his control? That could be another reason, in that he doesn’t to discuss something that he is doing terrible with, but again, I have no idea of his health or your situation.


Is he open about being Type 1 or is it something he hides, is tight-lipped about? Asking about it could run counter to how he wants to present it to the rest of the world.

My wonderful husband married me knowing full well what life would and could be like. I had been doing diabetes on my own for over 10 years when we meet and just celebrated my 50th year. He has been through it all with me. And early on, the lows were super hard on him. This was before CGM and pumps. For the longest time, I thought I hated him when I would yell and scream at him during my lows. Finally when I was seeking help with my depression, my therapist suggested my husband come to a session. So we all talked for an hour and my husband finally got the answer he needed from a professional not me. She told him that anything happening during a low was just my brain not firing correctly because it was screaming for glucose to stay alive. No brain functions correctly without glucose. She told him that my rages during my lows were not because I hated him. And she asked if I behaved the same with our children and he stopped and thought and said yes. So he knew how much I (we) love our children so it had to be no glucose causing the mood swings.
Of course my CGM has helped stop those scary lows. They are almost completely gone now. And while I still don’t share a lot about my day to day care, he does have a pretty good understanding of diabetes.
A CGM is a great place to start. I did find getting my blood sugars into a better spot ( not great at first but better) I mentally felt better. Less swings in blood sugars. Up and down blood sugars are physically and mentally exhausting.
And maybe finding a mental specialist who has knowledge of diabetes or chronic conditions might help. I was very fortunate to have an organization in town who deals with diabetes and the mental side of it. Good luck and have a talk with him about what he needs from you and what you need from him.

After running with the FreeStyle Libre with the MiaoMiao as a CGM system for two weeks, I’ve drawn some conclusions from use, although there’s a world of work to do to extract the data …





The comments received contain some interesting tidbits, including “thermal variation under the skin drives the variability in the tiny substrate layer that houses the glucose oxidase. It’s factory calibrated to produce a number, but should be adjused based on the thermistor output as it affects the catalyst efficiency.” (hence the reason many of us see lower than actual CGM readings when we awake)

373,What I wish gluco-normals understood about diabetes,Community,Terry4,5,"With the recent headline news about a cure for diabetes, I’m sure this community will now be faced with excited family, friends and acquaintances delivering to us the great news of an imminent cure. For those of us who’ve been dealing with T1 and T2 diabetes for decades, we’ve  been through this many times.
This story trades on the regrettable ignorance and short attention span of our society. Many people never read beyond the headlines. I just replied to a top post on a heavily-trafficked political website about this “cure.” I was the 66th comment and the first to point out this was a story about a diabetes cure in mice!
We struggle with the ignorance of society about diabetes. In order to protect our mental health, we’ve built up an emotional defense to the consequences of this ignorance. I’ve long ago accepted that this social ignorance is simply a consequence of human nature. People pay the most attention to the things that directly affect them. Learning the details of other people’s struggles is not as engaging.
I’m as guilty of this as my fellow humans. For instance, I don’t know much about muscular dystrophy. My primary focus on things medical is on T1D, a disease with an immediate and long-lasting personal effect.
If I could teach gluco-normals just one thing about diabetes, I would need to select it from a long list.


T1D is not T2D!


When media uses the word, diabetes, it really means T2D.


When headline writers uses the word cure in the context of diabetes, it almost always is a disingenuous and misleading tactic to reach more eyeballs.


Studies that report a T1D cure in mice are common and has yet, not even once, translated to a cure for T1D.


T1D is not juvenile diabetes, adult diagnosis is just as common as childhood diagnosis.


As a T1D, I cannot reverse my diabetes simply by losing weight.


For a T1D, insulin is rarely optional.


Well, I could continue this list, but you get the idea.
If I could instantly teach the public just one thing about diabetes, it would be this:

I’d rather not stir up the naming issue in this thread. I understand your rationale and do agree, but it’s complicated by the small number of T1Ds versus T2Ds as a basis for research funding and other political circumstances. Grassroots education about T1D as autoimmune and T2D as insulin resistance seems a better expenditure in resources.
As far as the “bad” type of diabetes, while I think that T1D requires more continuous attention, the comorbidities and mortality rates seem similar to me. T2D is much less demanding during the often long-undiagnosed period while it insidiously exacts long-term damage.
Couple that with a medical practitioner and societal lack of urgency regarding treatment causes many with T2D to feel any pressing need for effective treatment. “Just take your pills and move on with life” is a dangerous attitude that many settle into.
T1D, by contrast, demands your immediate attention and treatment. Ignore T1D and you will soon reach your expiration date! I’d rather live with T1D as it seems less complicated than T2D. I wouldn’t argue either type as better than the other.",Nov '20

Understand. I don’t expect the general public to understand this level of detail about diabetes. The question I ask is what higher level fact would you like the public to grasp about diabetes. Knowledge that there exists different types with basic material differences is important to me.
My list in the post was not intended to be comprehensive. If there is any other aspect of diabetes that you wish the public would understand, please comment.



 Jay6:

This cloak and dagger mentality causes needless delays in focused emergency medical and direct medical care.


It’s hard for me to identify with this as, from day one, I was always an open book about my diabetes, even in the workplace. I was lucky in that regard since I worked in a union environment and never had to worry about my job security with respect to diabetes.
But I found, even freely sharing how I treated my diabetes with coworkers and friends, they had a hard time retaining what I told them many times over many years. I would be surprised when, after many years and conversations, I would get a question like this, “If you pass out, does that mean you need insulin?”
I do know that many people with diabetes hide their condition and that can end up with both positive and negative effects. See @Brianna1’s all too common perception of workplace discrimination, often fueled by ignorance.
I agree, however, that making diabetes apparent to emergency staff is a good thing, providing that they understand the difference between T1D and T2D.
Far too many medical practitioners, including doctors and nurses don’t quite get the distinction between the two types. I learned this from the sincere questions from medicos when undergoing medical procedures and during office visits. I’ve been asked by medical staff when I inform them that I live with type 1 diabetes and they follow-up with, “Do you take insulin?” I am most surprised when I detect ignorance from an endocrinologist.

I just wrote on another thread some of the problems it now causes. A doctor telling a T1 recently that squash has too much sugar for her to eat. A chiro who had been a neonatal nurse before becoming a chiro telling me a couple of years ago that since I didn’t get it as a kid I could cure it. And 10 years ago a GP telling me medications wouldn’t have worked on me at all if I was a type 1.
Some of the newly diagnosed end up being very confused about what type they have and what it means. The newly diagnosed type 1 asking if they eat right can they get off of insulin, the type 2 that has really high levels and put on insulin right away to bring down their levels and thinks they have to be on insulin the rest of their life or worse they don’t have to change anything because insulin solves the issue. The fact that some type 2’s take insulin just helps mix and blend the two together.
I really feel the blending and mixing of the two types is compromising care and the ability it seems like for type 1’s to have access to what their type actually means in treatment, in diet, and that trickles down to accessing the tools that can help us.
And then there’s diabetes insipidus, this one is because the origin of latin diabetes definition is “passing through, a large discharge of urine” and diabetes insipidus is a disease that has nothing to do with the pancreas or blood sugar but it happens when the kidneys produce a lot of extra pee.

An inability for people to update their knowledge in the presence of new information is a problem. I think the emotion part of the brain over-rules the fact part of the brain every time. Perhaps people’s fear is what drives their inability to adjust to new information.
In any case, you still need to deal with this. You and your doctor know what type of diabetes you live with. As long as you base your treatments on this reality, you can thrive.
The more difficult problem you face is that your social circle does not support your everyday efforts. Perhaps you could seek some counseling that would help you deal with this.

In your experience, do you have an estimate of the percentage of calls that were either directly related to diabetes or that knowing someone was either T1 or T2 would have made a significant difference in your treatment and/or approach?


I’ll add to what Jay6 replied, as a younger diabetic and ex-EMT. I would say that the primary influence of diabetes on protocol (especially now) is that almost EVERYONE gets a blood sugar reading when I work . But, when other people work, certainly EVERYONE who is drunk or has any kind of altered level of consciousness SHOULD get a BG. But, they do not always.
I think that what is important to recognize is that cops are (generally) 1st responders (1 license step below EMTs) and they don’t check BG. Although they might be ‘varianced’ to do this in some jurisdictions. That will be determined by your local Medical Director (who is the King Doctor for your areas local Emergency Medical System). The thing about cops is that there is a difference in perspective. Police will almost always assume that you are drunk or on drugs. But, if you are out cold, police (or anyone) can check med tags. Med tags help. When I worked with other EMTS, I was a HUGE proponent for med tags. If people don’t check med tags, then we have a discussion.
If your medics can physically see that you are a diabetic, there is a greater chance that they take control of the scene (as opposed to the police). We want the medics in control, not the cops because cops will take you to jail and assume drunk/drug use every time. Med tags help you advocate for your medics so that they can advocate for you. When cops and EMTs disagree, cops often win (although that is NOT how it is supposed to work - they are both peace officers).
“A law passed in 2015 has cleared the way for more first responders to check patients’ blood glucose levels . Previously, only advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics were allowed to conduct the simple finger sticks that can indicate a patient may be diabetic” (Indiana State Law - https://www.in.gov/dhs/files/HR_Jan_16.pdf).
Here’s some stats that cite 2% of all EMS calls are attributable to diabetic symptoms.

EMS1 2



How frequently do EMS providers encounter, treat hypoglycemia? 2
Top takeaways for prehospital care of diabetic patients after filtering 2.5 million EMS encounters in the EMS Index





“Primary Impression” means that they look at you and can tell your in diabetic shock - not that they have checked BG. Primary impression can dictate who takes primary control over the event - the police or the medics. EMTs can argue & disagree about primary impression. Police and EMTs can disagree over primary impression. You want to help them get this right. If they see med tags, that really helps them make their case that this is indeed a ‘medical event,’ not a call for a drunk.
EMTs and paramedics will not treat hyperglycemia. They treat hypoglycemia. Knowing that someone has a common chronic illness is very important and helps dictate treatment. There are many, many circumstances that cause someone to pass out. Med tags help direct them to the most likely cause of the problem very quickly and are very helpful because sometimes people have more than one problem at the same time.
Compare the % of diabetic calls that medics get (2%) to the % of calls that the police get for someone who is intoxicated (36%). That is why police always believe that we are drunk…because everyone (over 1/3 of people that) they deal with are drunk. That tells you why diabetes is dangerous ground - also sometimes diabetics have low BG AND they are drunk. People get confused, get it wrong, and are very biased towards assuming that we are drunk. That is very dangerous for us. But, it is also very dangerous for people with other conditions, too. The police may assume that they are on drugs if their behavior isn’t normal.

When I change my set, I leave the old one in. Start pumping with the new one. Then I remove the old one after several hours.
I think maybe removing the set allows the insulin in there to leak out or just not absorb with the change in pressure.

405,Sites changes and highs,Type 1 and LADA,waynec2,,"@Timothy It makes sense to keep the old infusion set at place. Some of the remaining insulin (~2u) inside the infusion tube somehow find way to leak into tissue without being pumped.  This would supplement the absorption issue at the new site.
I have similar issues in certain heavy used sites.  I find out only after 2 hours post-meal, the BG doesn’t drop.  Your experience gives me the following idea that I plan to try from now on:

After the new infusion set inserted, I will keep the old infusion set for several (x) hours (x=2/Basel).
I will move or keep the tube anchor point higher than the injection point, so that the remaining insulin could gravity-flow to the injection point since there is no pump to push them in.  Hopefully, the gravity will allow portion of the remaining 2 units insulin flow into body.

After filling the tubing, I separate at the tag part that you unhook to take a shower and connect to the old site.  Then I attach the tag part into a new site.  I feel like it is letting the new site get a chance to get settled in.  In that window of settling in, I just use the old site.
When I do switch connection, I will give .1 like others have said.  If my new site is in a low absorption location I may use a syringe for the first bolus, but basal continues as normal.
An extended bolus for protein and fat are with the new site.  I hope this makes sense.  It works for me and has cut out some of the highs with a site change.  However, not everything everytime with D is predictable.",Nov '20

I think there is some confusion over what generation of Medtronic CGM sensors are being used. I haven’t been following this closely, but I think the next model of Medtronic’s CGM sensors will not require initial calibration. But it’s not available yet so currently available Medtronic pumps will still use the Guardian 3 sensor/transmitter combo.
I assume the pump will be able to use the next model of sensors when Medtronic releases them or, at worst, an update to the pump’s firmware will need to be downloaded to enable that.

If you typically under count it will have trouble keeping up without correcting for it. We all have seen this with un-announced meals or just under counting carbs. It can ruin your day.  The new 780g released in Europe solves this problem in a much better way. So, while I did not get the how - I did get some definition around the algorithm being more aggressive than what is currently on the market. The Algorithm was currently developed in Israel for adaptation.  The 780 solves for this in a much better way with the new Dremed algorithm.  This has been presented to the FDA for review. The 770 is the bridge to the 780 and will be less money from what I understand. There is some conversation on the 780g forums in Europe that talk about the functionality. People seem really jazzed.

Just remember that you’ve got to take everything you hear from a company representative with a grain of salt.  They’re not going to tell you good things about the competition   i can tell you from experience that this is not true at all of Tandem’s Control-IQ.  I just generally guesstimate insulin and it’s great at smoothing out the rest. I seldom bolus for small snacks and I sometimes forget to bolus for a meal at all until my “did you bolus??” alarm goes off at 140.
Today was one of those nights…  It’s not a model graph to be proud of, but if is a good real world example.  I had a bowl of split pea soup, 2 buttered thick slices of homemade bread for dipping, and a cup of hot chocolate with mini marshmallows for dessert.  I’m no low-carber.
Anddd totally forgot to bolus until the alarm went off at 140.  I was already on a normally unstoppable accent at that point.  But Control-IQ adjusted my basal and added extra insulin in the background.  Not enough to fully cover my meal.  I still had to bolus.  But it gave enough to avoid disaster.  I topped out at 188.  While it’s higher than my personal upper range of 160, it’s only barely outside the ADA guideline of 180, and only for 3 readings.  Had I remembered to pre-bolus, or bolus at all really, I probably would have never crossed 140.

I don’t have experience with the 670g, so I can’t speak on that specifically…
But I think the biggest problem with switching to  automated insulin dosing is that it exacerbates any problems in your pump settings.  It’s always been a struggle to find a balance of numbers that “work” for someone.  Many people fight and fight and never do actually find a working combo.  One setting that would deliver too much insulin can be offset by another setting that would under-deliver, and you might THINK you’re dialed in…  You don’t realize how far off your settings actually are until they’re being implemented minute by minute to make adjustments.  It highlights every weakness.
That’s why you see such a strong division of love it or hate it amongst Control-IQ users.  The system works phenomenally with the right settings, and I can’t wait to see how much it gets better with the looming software update that is supposed to improve customization options.  Unfortunately, not everyone has the knowledge or the support to get their settings dialed in.  Those poor souls are still on the frustrating rollercoaster that bad settings yield.
While I’m no fan of Medtronic and I know there were other problems with the system, I highly suspect that a lot of their furious 670g patient base was also because of this incorrect settings problem.  The pumps can only work within the parameters you set.  Being the first on the market, I think it was such a disgruntling change that many gave in to the frustrations before finding a way to make it work for them.  I think it was a cost they paid for being first to market.  I think they greased a few wheels for Tandem to come in and rescue the weary.
That said… I think it’s a given that the 770 and 780 pumps will bring a better user experience.  They HAVE to.  Metronic has been very forthcoming about the 670g not being “well received”, and all of their conference presentations I’ve seen have focused on the improved patient experience.  In terms of glycemic control improvements, they were pretty much on par with Tandem’s 2019 Control-IQ trials.  I think I’ve gotta give Tandem the edge there, though, because Tandem’s next gen software, due early this year, should offer further improvements yet, leaving Medtronic a few years behind.
But clinical trials aren’t the big picture.  I’m very curious to see how the 770/780 plays out in the real world.  While I currently think the X2 is the best pump on the market, I’m not brand loyal to Tandem.  I’m out of warranty in five months, and gathering all the info I can to make my next decision.  I’m a little too excited for the unveiling of Tandem’s T:sport (working name, might be different when it comes to market later this year), though, so I might be biased.  I could talk myself into a Metronic if the 780 proves more impressive, though.",11d

I am really leery about medtronic’s sensors. I know some people have great accuracy and others not so good. I like the idea of this pump being able to get software updates. Medtronic is supposed to launch a calibration free sensor that won’t need any over tape. This all sounds very exciting. Eventually they might even integrate with dexcom, who knows. I am really leery about upgrading. The worse that can happen is that I go back to dexcom if the guardian 3 sensors don’t  work for me and wait for medtronic to get with the times. I know the g6 is pretty accurate but there have been times when I’ve actually been high and it didn’t catch it. Everything has it’s flaws. I am always on top of my diabetes and follow all the rules.

Overall the dexcom is a better CGM but I like Medtronic from an integrated package. Most of us go out and don’t use the Medtronic supplied tape and buy patches which fit over the sensors. They are waterproof and keep from moving etc. The accuracy for me is the same if not better than dex . Yes calibration is still necessary. But going away soon with guardian 4. The pump is the cornerstone of your decision so I recommend guardian. If you asked me a year ago I would choose differently but with the new 780 coming the enhancements and algorithm far exceed what is available in the Medtronic eco system and what is available commercia. lGuardian 4 is also pending some time next year and will be smaller, no calibration and or taping.

Do you get the sensor patches from a  website? Is Medtronic going to charge people for software updates? They better not! It would be a bad move on their part, I think. I am very sensitive to lows (especially in the warmer temps) and it would be nice for my pump to suspend when low and adjust my basal rate and do corrections. 12 years ago when I was on an Animas 2020 I would have never thought that this was even possible. I have been talking with a few people in the UK that have the 780 and alot said it was good. I would love a pump that helps take the burden of managing diabetes and integrates with a cgm. Another reason for me wanting this pump is because I won’t be able to get a new pump until Feb 2023. I also tried the tslim but some  of my basal rates are below the minimum on a tslim. I wasn’t able to use it. That’s a long time to wait, especially if better algorithms become available. You see, in Ontario diabetics on an insulin pump recieve anew pump every 5 years and we also get 2,400$ a year. 600$ paid every 4 months to help with supplies.

They said the current transmitter could only pair with one bluetooth device at a time so it would require a new transmitter to allow pairing with two devices at the same time.

I also use a reservoir 5-6 days. It seems to only happen at the bottom of the reservoir no matter what I tried. I tried filling the reservoir with less insulin, changing the type of infusion set, using extended boluses near the bottom of the reservoir, and a few others I don’t recall. If finally threw in the towel and diluted Fiasp 80/20 with Humalog and things were fine. But what a pain in the rear that is!
My theory, completely speculative, is that Fiasp is more viscous than Humalog or Novolog (due to additives) and that presents problems with Tandem’s unique pumping mechanism.

@Paytone I don’t think your Tandem pump and its unique internal configuration has anything to do with Fiasp gumming up the works (occluding the plumbing) that some of us have experienced.

But I was curious about the X2 with Control IQ and asked my doc if I could try it out.

Once I figured out to stay in sleep mode and have my basal TDD be 30U when I actually only use 19U it was all smooth sailing which compounded the problem further!

If there’s a problem, you’re better equipped than most to handle it… Because you know exactly how to do MDI still, while most pumpers just have a foggy idea of their “backup plan”.  (I get a new bottle every year of long-acting, just to keep in the fridge for emergencies.)
Yep, bent canulas suck.  If you apply then carefully, though, they become rare.  Most bent canulas are caused by pulling the cannula off the insertion needle, usually by yanking the blue needle cover off too aggressively (gently twist to loosen it), or by pulling the adhesive cover straight up, rather than angling the paper off to the side of the set.  If you’re just too lean for the autosofts, you could always try TruSteel sets.
I am a little concerned about you injecting R, though.  Can you better explain why you think the extended bonus feature doesn’t work for you?  You know you can adjust the settings to be nearly anything you want, right, not just the default 50% now and 50% over the next 2 hours.  You can tell it to deliver 0% now and 100% over the next 45 minutes, which I think would closest emulate R, but some trial and erroring would dial it in for you.
At the end of the day, though, the pump should be a tool you WANT.  It should improve your life.  There are lots of people who choose MDI because they enjoy the untethered lifestyle.  I was sooooooo excited to choose the X2 for my first pump after MDI for 28 years.  I live having that technology working for me, and I’m living a much better life because of it.

475,Mental barriers with insulin pumps,Type 1 and LADA,Terry4,2,"Before I started on an automated insulin dosing system, I used pump-extended boluses to dose insulin based on protein and fat grams. Here’s the system I used; you would need to do you own personal experimentation to confirm or adjust.
I first used the pump to deliver a meal dose of insulin based on the carbohydrate content of the meal. With that out of the way, I then added 50% of the protein grams to 10% of the fat grams. I called this sum, “carb equivalents.”
I then divided this carb equivalent number by my insulin to carb ratio to determine the total extended bolus. I delivered this quantity at a maximum rate of 1.2 units/hour. This often led to an extended bolus duration of 3-6 hours.
I found this system very effective for controlling post meal glucose. If you choose to experiment, it is not nearly as complicated as my above description may appear.
Your comments make me think that you are burning out with both your MDI and pump regimens. If the trace above represents MDI treatment, then I’m thinking you don’t really need to do anything else. Great BG trace, by the way!
If diabetes burnout is at the bottom of your weariness of all treatment methods, then you should address that separately. That’s a tough but not insurmountable challenge!
If your MDI effort is burning you out more, then perhaps you could do some pump-delivered extended boluses. I don’t like the percentage-based splits for extended boluses and prefer just doing the immediate carb-bolus first and then follow-up separately with a pure extended bolus of x number of units over y number of hours.
I found the separate nature of these two meal boluses easier to analyze and adjust. But that’s just me, many people get used to the % split method and do well with it.
Your BG control is excellent with MDI and I’m sure you could make the pump work for you if you chose to. Burnout is a real thing and you should address it. Some might see the motivation I take from a 48-hour trace like you painted above as obsessive or weird, but it does energize me. It allows me to credit myself with competence at doing something many people find hard. I take pleasure in excellent diabetes control and I think it fuels my long-game.

476,Mental barriers with insulin pumps,Type 1 and LADA,nebo,1,"Thanks Terry. I assume your strategy was FPU based? I tried Loop in the past and that is what I did then, I don’t think I can do that with the X2 because extended boluses are capped to 2 hours and you cannot “stack” them so if I were to run one for 2 hours but eat again 1:45 later I would have to wait to start a new one. That is one of the things I REALLY liked about loop, just add more carbs/“carbs” and it would handle it.
I do agree I need to address the burnout in some fashion. I don’t think it’s really related to MDI or pumps, just diabetes in general. I’m young by a lot of people standards, only 30 (and T1 for 16 of those years now), but it’s finally gotten to me.
The trace is on a pump though I can do the same with MDI. Looking back the last week on a pump is 95% in the 70-140 range with only 2 readings < 70; I cannot do that on MDI without significant mental effort.
I too get satisfaction looking at reports, it’s why I use nighscout since I think it’s easily the best out of what exists. Sugarmate is good too for a day by day and to see the “time in range” metric on a running length basis.
This is MDI but on a really good streak. It’s part of what makes this difficult is I know I can do fine no matter what and is the physical attachment worth it? Something for me to figure out.

Control-IQ was designed to get that average diabetic up to standard.
The high achievers have to really hack the system to make it bend to our will.
Unfortunately, they made some massive changes to what we already knew about pumping, so had to lock in a lot of settings.  Designing the software for the lowest common denominator…  That’s why you’re stuck with a max extended bolus of 2 hours.  The automation algorithm is supposed to cover anything beyond that.  You can turn control-iq off and extend up to 4 hours, if you want.
If you stick with it long enough, the pump will sort of retrain you, unbeknownst to you, and you find you just learn to behave within it’s limited parameters.  It’s fairly common to see comments like “the first month was awful, but I’m loving it now!”.

I’m surprised that the X2 limits extended boluses to 2 hours. What benefit did designers think they reaped with this limit? I’m baffled.
Your use of R to help manage your glucose levels reminds me of Dr. Bernstein’s protocol. I think R corresponds well with my extended bolusing routine. With the X2 limiting extended boluses to two hours, perhaps adding R without the pump’s knowledge is the way to work around that X2 design bug.

This supports your favoring pump management over MDI with all things being equal. I’ve been using pumps since 1987 and have taken a few pump vacations, up to three months, but have always returned to the pump. It makes my life easier, not harder.
Now I’ve lived through all of the weaknesses of pump therapy and know that pump failures can seriously threaten your well-being. But once you know how to counteract and watch out for those failures, life can be good.
If anyone uses a pump, they must monitor their blood glucose closely or they risk sliding into DKA with a bad infusion site or a pump occlusion. I almost think that a CGM is a fundamental requirement for safe operation of a pump for most people.
I also use Nightscout and do like the comprehensive look of its dashboard. I use NS to not only monitor BG and modulated basal profile of Loop, but also use it to monitor my infusion set age as we’ll as my CGM sensor age. When these items light up red on my NS screen, it prompts me to change them out before they start to impair my system.

Basal-IQ technology uses CGM to predict and help prevent lows by suspending insulin delivery when glucose is predicted to go below 80 mg/dL. Basal-IQ technology predicts glucose values 30 minutes a...





You can start with Basal IQ only, and later upgrade to Control IQ if you want. But once upgraded, can’t go back.
I started with Conttrol-IQ, so did not use Basal-IQ.  I think @Laddie is trying B-IQ only first, then will decide whether to switch to C-IQ.
You can find lots of videos on Tandem site, or download an app to get simulation of Tandem X2 menus/options.
I used Medtronic pump for 20+ years, but only the 5xx and 7xx older models, since I also used dexcom instead of medtronic Cgms. So all pump settings/deliveries were from basic settings, no auto-mode.  I appreciated the postings that discussed some of the issues with 670+ but understand there have been some improvements.",Dec '20
488,Question for 630G users,Diabetes Technology,Ruth4,,"I’m a long-time Medtronic pump user, upgraded to the 630G about a year ago.
On the Paradigm, I used to get about 5-6 weeks on a battery.  Since I got the 630G, I’d been getting about 4 weeks on a battery.
For the last couple of months, I’m only getting two weeks on a battery!  Does anyone have any ideas as to why this might be happening.  I don’t think I’m testing any  more often (7-8 times a day), so I have no idea what could possibly have changed.
Any advice/tips would be appreciated.",22d
489,Question for 630G users,Diabetes Technology,irrational_JohnType 1 or LADA,,"I have always just assumed, without ever actually experimenting to attempt to prove it, that the biggest source of battery drain on the 630G is the color screen. The only suggestion that comes to mind is to make sure you set the Backlight Timeout and Display Brightness settings in the Display Options under Utilities to their lowest possible values.
You can also try to minimize how often you view the pump’s display. That never seems to work for me because I like to check my glucose graph frequently throughout the day, but maybe it would work for others?
Finally, you don’t have to wait for the Backlight Timeout to expire to turn off the display. You can force the display to turn off by holding the “menu button” (right hand side) down for a few seconds.

Whatever the cause, I can agree with you that Medtronic’s 630G is definitely a power hog. One of the things I like least but also consider least likely to change these pumps is how quickly it eats through batteries. ",22d
490,Question for 630G users,Diabetes Technology,edoshea,,I have had the 630 for about a year as well.  Get about a month on the battery.  I don’t know why but when I change battery it is difficult.  Keeps saying needs new battery even though I just put in a new one.  Takes about 5 minutes and 3-4 tries before it realizes the battery is new?,22d
491,Question for 630G users,Diabetes Technology,Ruth4,,"Irrational_John:  Thanks so much for the advice.  I just lowered the brightness and the length of time the screen stays lit.
What I don’t understand, however, is why this sudden change?  The brightness and length of time were the same as they were pre-set from the factory for the entire past year…I had never changed it  (or even realized that I could!), but just suddenly, about two months ago, I started having to replace the battery every two weeks instead of every four.  I’ll let you know what happens with the reduce brightness and time length of lighting.
Edoshea:  I initially found the battery difficult to replace because of the battery cap…it doesn’t “sit” as easily as on the Paradigm.  Finally realized that you have to “push” the cap in at the same time you’re twisting it.  I use the handle of one of my spoons, but you could use a wide-edged screwdriver.  It makes it a lot easier.  Of course, I’m not sure that’s exactly the problem you’ve been having, but worth a try, no?",22d
492,Question for 630G users,Diabetes Technology,Rphil2Type 1 or LADA,,"You might dialing back screen brightness and to a smaller extent volume.  If you are using the Medtronic sensor it will drain faster.
Also the freshness of the battery is also a factor.
i use the 670g with sensor and find I get about 10 days to two weeks on one battery.
By the way, this seems to be a really good source of batteries for me.

493,Question for 630G users,Diabetes Technology,Ruth4,,"Thanks, Rick.  I already dialed back the brightness and set the time the light is on back to only one minute.  Hopefully that will help.  I don’t use a CGM, so no extra use there.

494,Question for 630G users,Diabetes Technology,irrational_JohnType 1 or LADA,,"


 Ruth4:

I already dialed back the brightness and set the time the light is on back to only one minute.


I set mine to the minimum of 15 seconds and that’s what I would also recommend you try.
My thinking is that if the 15 second timeout turns out to be annoying when you’re using the display, you can always increase it. But if it isn’t, then there’s a chance you’ll get more economical use of your batteries.
Setting the display timeout to 15 secs does not mean the display will go dark after 15 seconds. The timer is reset every time you press a button. For example, the timer resets when you are scrolling with the arrow buttons or navigating to a sub-menu. The 15 seconds only starts when you are no longer pressing a button. In other words, it only starts counting down when you are no longer doing anything with the pump other than possibly looking at the display.
It all depends on how you use your pump, I guess. I tend to glance at it most often. The long meaningful stares are fewer and farther between. 
Also, don’t forget about pressing & holding the menu button for 2-3 seconds. This puts the pump in “sleep mode” and is a way of turning off the display without having to wait for the display timeout to expire.",20d

 Rphil2:

this seems to be a really good source of batteries for me.


Rick, I’m confused. My understanding is that Medtronic requires using lithium batteries in it’s 6xx series of pumps. But the link included in your post is for alkaline batteries.
Am I mistaken?",20d
496,Question for 630G users,Diabetes Technology,Rphil2Type 1 or LADA,,"this is the direction from the medtronic site.
The pump requires one new AA (1.5 V) battery. For best results, use a new AA lithium (FR6) battery. The pump also accepts an AA alkaline (LR6) or a fully charged AA NiMH (HR6) nickel-metal hydride rechargeable battery.

498,Question for 630G users,Diabetes Technology,Barry4,,"Hi Ruth,
I have been on a 630 for about two years and was getting 30 t0 40 days on a an Energizer. That has been great because on the Paradigm I was getting no more than 2 weeks. During the last two months it has drastically dropped to only getting 2 weeks or less.  I tried a lithium ultimate Energizer this time and it has lasted 18 days so far, although I expect it to fail any time now.  I was ready to contact Medtronic because I once had a pump that started to require batteries more and more often.  They had me send it in for service and that corrected the problem.

Let me know how the lithium Energizer works out.  I had just bought a pack of double A’s, so I’ll use them up, but if the lithium lasts longer, maybe I’ll get those next time.

500,Question for 630G users,Diabetes Technology,Barry4,,"Hi Ruth,
The lithium ultimate energizer lasted 22 days (had to change it on Christmas day). Over the last several months the regular energizers were only lasting 13 to 14 days. It’s worth a try.

504,Question about Medtronic MiniMed 630G,Type 1 and LADA,Rphil2Type 1 or LADA,,"Deny
I only used the 630g for about 5 months a few years ago. But I can say the 670g was getting between 2 wks and 10 days on a single battery. This depends on how far you are willing to let it go down. I tend to change mine within a day or so if getting to yellow.
Using the sensor will deplete the battery quicker so if you are not using the battery you will get greater use.
I have heard of non sensor users getting 3-4 weeks but again I think that depends how far you are willing to let it go into yellow. (Running out of power is one of my obsessions so I change quickly, hey we all have our thing).
If you are getting less than 10 days in a new battery I would call Medtronic. They may advise trying a different battery. I use energizer alkaline batteries.
This is the purchase option I use fir batteries.

I got on Metformin and Victoza and managed to lose 50 lbs through diet and these meds. About 2014, I decided to stop Victoza and gained back about 25 lbs.  I dropped that weight again another two years later by getting into an exercise program and doing clean eating.  I then dropped out of the exercise program about 1 year an a half later because the gym was very expensive.  I gained back about 15 lbs and my blood sugar management was out of control.  My A1C was not horrible — 6.5 but my moods were not manageable.  I love chocolate:(((. Sugar is my downfall and laziness tho I’m a really busy piano teacher and mom to two fabulous but chronically ill kiddos (who r not so young anymore (17 & 19).  Writing this makes me realize how up and down I’ve been for too many years.  So went back to a good endocrinologist to get help and we tried Ozempic but the higher dosage flattened my mood and I felt horrible on it.  So back to Victoza I went — thinking this was successful before why not go back to it.  The first dosage was fine .6 but then 1.2 started to affect my mood badly again w/i two weeks:((.

550,GetInsulin.org Addresses Immediate Needs of People Struggling to Access Insulin,Treatment,MilaStaff,3,"SAN CARLOS, Calif., Oct. 5, 2020  /PRNewswire/ – A new tool for anyone in the United States struggling to access life-sustaining insulin launched today at GetInsulin.org 16. Created by global diabetes nonprofit organization Beyond Type 1, GetInsulin.org 16 connects people with diabetes who take insulin to assistance programs and low-cost solutions that match their unique situation.
Insulin is a life-essential medicine for over seven million people with diabetes living in the US today. The list price is high, and not taking insulin is not an option. GetInsulin.org 16 is an important resource for people who need help affording their insulin today.
On GetInsulin.org 16, users answer a few questions (such as location, insurance type, income, and type of insulin they take) then receive customized action plans to guide them through the access solutions and next steps needed. The site and plan details are available in English and Spanish, can be downloaded or emailed, with the option for follow-up reminders when life changes may happen.
GetInsulin.org 16 is supported by a coalition of partners helping connect those in need to lower-cost insulin now, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists (ADCES), the Endocrine Society, Feeding America, JDRF, The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the National Hispanic Medical Association (NHMA). GetInsulin.org 16 is funded by Lilly, Mylan, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi.
People with diabetes in the United States face serious health complications or death when they cannot access insulin. Since 2013, the list price of insulin has skyrocketed, leaving people without health insurance or on high-deductible insurance plans paying out-of-pocket upwards of $1,000 for a one-month supply of insulin, often unaware of assistance options. This is the result of a unique drug pricing crisis going on in the United States that will require widespread healthcare reform to bring list prices down.
“Insulin is not optional for people with diabetes. The current drug pricing system that leaves many unsure of how to access their insulin needs to change, and that change will take time. Right now there are assistance options out there for many struggling to access insulin, but individuals may not know about programs or those programs may be difficult to navigate,” said Beyond Type 1 CEO Thom Scher. “GetInsulin.org 16 is designed to address this immediate and solvable problem - to simplify the process of getting people to the right help and getting them access to insulin in the immediate term.”
Beyond Type 1 advocates for high quality, modern insulin to be available to people with diabetes regardless of employment or insurance status, across all demographics, without barriers, and at an affordable and predictable price point. Until that is achieved, GetInsulin.org 16 will be a resource for those needing access to insulin options immediately.
“The American Diabetes Association is honored to partner with Beyond Type 1 and the coalition of organizations committed to raising awareness of GetInsulin.org 16, a critical tool for people who need insulin right now,” said Tracey D. Brown, CEO of the ADA. “We need to both connect people to life-saving solutions today, and work towards a system that doesn’t leave so many in need of help accessing a drug they need to stay alive.”
If you or someone you love is struggling to access insulin, go to GetInsulin.org 7.

551,GetInsulin.org Addresses Immediate Needs of People Struggling to Access Insulin,Treatment,mohe0001,1,"This is specific to insulin access in Minnesota. But, even if your not in MN, I think that the lawsuit between Pharma and the State is pretty interesting.
Greetings #insulin4all members,
Since the enactment of The Alec Smith Emergency Insulin Act, we have heard from many who have successfully utilized it. We are ecstatic to see this law helping those in need! A reminder to please visit MNinsulin.org 1 to check for eligibility, and find other important information about the Insulin Safety Net Program here in Minnesota. We understand that there has been some obstacles and challenges for some with the application process. If you are experiencing any difficulties with the application process or pharmacy compliance there are many ways we can help. Please reach out to one of our Minnesota #insulin4all executive members via our Facebook Page, or by email at mninsulin4all@t1international.com
As some of you may have heard, on the evening just prior to Alec Smith’s Act becoming law, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) filed a lawsuit against the state of Minnesota to overturn this critical bill. The lawsuit itself did not prevent the bill from becoming law. With the help of National Health Law Program (NHeLP), Minnesota advocates, T1International, and Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid (MMLA), an amicus brief was flied to uphold this law. You can find more about the brief and terms of the lawsuit in this press release from NHeLP.
A hearing will be held on December 8th, 2020 to determine the next step in this lawsuit and to see what judgements will be made to either uphold or overturn The Alec Smith Insulin Affordability Act. We are pained to again face obstacles in simply finding a way for insulin to be accessible and affordable for our community. We know that this lawsuit is just another attempt by insulin manufacturers to retain their profits and overlook patients who are suffering greatly at their hands. Regardless of the judgement made in this case, we will not stop advocating for you all!

I understand your feelings very well. My father also got diabetes, maybe it is genetic. My grandfather also has a history of diabetes.
My father rarely drinks alcohol and smokes at all. High-sugar foods are hard to eat. This does not matter. The main problem is that his current mental state is not very good, especially when his condition is aggravated, his mood is very low, and he is not interested in many good things in life. We used to prepare a lot of gifts and parties in advance of Christmas. Now he rarely proposes to eat, drink and have fun.
I have collected a lot of questions about people with diabetes online, and I hope to find some comforting answers here.

Since November 16 all my approvals have been in place and I placed on online order on November 18 since no one ever called me back (as promised) when the approvals were in place to create the order.  I have called customer service every day - three times today as one call was dropped - and each time everyone looks at the paperwork and tells me I’m good to go but nothing ever goes.  Dexcom  “quality control” was the problem  for a few days,  This evening I was told there was a mistake in the old order so one rep cancelled it and then dropped the call.  This last call the rep went over all of the paperwork again and created an expedited order.  I would guess that I have a 50% chance - or less - of having this processed so that I receive the transmitter by Monday.
No one is willing to pass a call to a supervisor.  Everyone has to check whether I’ve changed my health insurance and doctor in the last 24 hours.  Everyone is nice and no one can get anything done.
I almost never get so frustrated at customer service that I shout into the phone.  Dexcom broke me today.

He and my nurse offered some advice about it, but because it's not a very widely used drug, especially for T1's, their information was limited. I've taken it for two days now, just with dinner. Both days, I got a hypo about 1-2 hours after my meal. When I asked my nurse if I would need to adjust my bolus to a square or dual wave, she said no, but if Glucobay prolongs your absorption of carbs, then to me, that would make more sense. I wonder if that is why I'm experiencing the hypo's?Secondly, what other options are out there for treating hypo's while on this drug? From what the nurse provided me with, my options are limited to dextrose (those tabs make me gag), honey and milk (also, yuck). Any other ideas?

589,New to Glucobay (Acarbose),Type 1 and LADA,HolgerType 1 or LADA,2,Glucobay will partially prevent that the digested carbohydrates are absorbed. Many carbs will get flushed out without being digested. To be more exact some bacteria in your colon will consume the carbs. As a result of the 40g you have eaten just 20g are absorbed (just a guess). So your expectation that it just prolongs the absorbtion is not correct. Of course to compensate for the lower amount of carbs in your blood stream you need to lower your bolus!

I use 7 units of Tresiba for basal;  and for bolus I use Novolog.  The bolus amount can be as much as  10 or more units for a meal.   The usual dinner is about 6-7 units.  Lunch is also 6-7 units.
My pancreas does not appear to be able to keep up with the meal time rise in BG.  So I use Novolog.  My question is : I think I still produce insulin because my Tresiba amount is not much.  So, I think that a drug like Acarbose may help me, perhaps reduce the quantity of meal time insulin.

I have found that I use far less quantities of Novolog when taking it together with Acarbose.  For a meal of about 30-40 gram carb, I use 1.5 units Novolog with Acarbose.

595,Injections vs insulin pumps,Type 1 and LADA,Baddog40,,"I’m seriously considering switching over to a pump and was hoping to get some insight from those who have. The two main reasons for doing so are I have very tight control (last A1C was 5.4), but in order to do this requires multiple injections daily, even if its 2 or 3 units. The other reason is I have I guess dawn phenomenon. I can run a steady 100 all night but at 4-5 every morning it starts to rise and if I don’t get up and take 3 units of insulin it will be close to 200 by 8am.
I am assuming a pump would solve this issue, but would I be able to keep as tight of control as I am now? Especially using a Tslim with my Dexcom?
To those of you that have switched are you glad you did?",21d
596,Injections vs insulin pumps,Type 1 and LADA,LaddieType 1 or LADA,6,"You can definitely have tight control with a pump and CGM. Although you may still battle dawn phenomenon, a pump allows you to program higher basal rates at the appropriate time to mostly tame it.
I use a Tandem pump and a Dexcom G6. My old pump was programmed with Control IQ and just went out of warranty. I chose to get the new one with Basal IQ.
I used Control IQ for almost a year and liked many things about it and hated other things. It is superb for preventing lows but not as good at preventing highs although it definitely helps with highs. Sleep Mode when used 24/7 allows you to target a lower target range than regular Control IQ, but that range is 110-120. There are people on Facebook who are getting very low average BG’s while using Control IQ and one guy last week reported an A1c of 4.6. For me that would be impossible because my insulin always suspended when I trended lower and then I would go high later on. I consistently had an average of 120 with Control IQ but my A1c’s were still below 6. My endo was thrilled with those numbers because at age 68, she doesn’t want me having lows.
I have been using the older software Basal IQ which only addresses lows and uses a different algorithm from Control IQ for suspending insulin. I like that my insulin suspensions aren’t as long and I can control my target ranges. But after a couple of weeks I am finding that I miss some of the good things of Control IQ. I can always go back to the old pump and can also upgrade the new pump to Control IQ.
Control IQ is a first generation hybrid artificial pancreas system and in future years we’ll see lots of improvements and more user-controlled settings. Some people love it (especially people with previous higher A1c’s) and others are frustrated by it (especially people with lower A1c’s). My experience was that there was a lot to like and a lot to be frustrated about. For sure it was not less work although at times it enabled me to forget diabetes.
In the end Type 1 diabetes is difficult and my experiences with different technologies and ways of administering insulin just highlight how difficult it is. But I find that the better my tools are, the better I expect to do. So diabetes stays challenging.
I have been pumping for over 15 years and have never considering going back to injections full time. At the same time I believe that most motivated people can get just as good of control with injections.
Given the pumps and CGMs currently on the market, t:slim and Dexcom are all that I would currently consider. I previously had a bad experience with Omnipod although many people love it. I wouldn’t go to Medtronic because I won’t use their sensors. So right now there is not a lot of choice in the pump market.
Good luck with your decision. Chances are you would like pumping a lot. And if you don’t you could always go back to injections.",21d
597,Injections vs insulin pumps,Type 1 and LADA,Terry4,3,"Many people using pumps enjoy tight control but they do have to work at it. Programming a pump to dose for dawn phenomena is definitely possible but don’t expect to discover a formula that will not require tweaking and adjustments over time. Diabetes remains a moving target that you need to pay attention to and change your settings when it changes.



 Laddie:

But I find that the better my tools are, the better I expect to do.


This squares with my perception of glucose management. For the last four years I’ve used a do-it-yourself hybrid closed-loop system whose performance I’d have a hard time reproducing with injections. It makes dosing decisions while I sleep, something no multiple injections system can do.
The commercial hybrid systems like Tandem’s Control-IQ  are reaching toward this performance and, as Laddie points out, their track record is mixed but they will get better over time.
I do believe, however, that the knowledge and dedication of the person with diabetes counts for a lot. There are people who follow Dr. Richard Bernstein’s low carb methods using injections alone who consistently over many years post A1c’s in upper 4% to lower 5% range.
Bernstein is not a fan of insulin pumps and does not use one. He’s in his mid-80s, and has lived with T1D for almost his entire life. He still sees patients in his clinic and currently posts diabetes videos to YouTube.
I’m not quite as dedicated as the most ardent Bernstein followers. My Loop system enables me to deal with the inevitable glucose variability inherent in diabetes. What I’m trying to say is that a person with diabetes can do very well using a pump or on multiple daily injections.
One of the things that I like about pump therapy is that it records your doses and you can always check the size and time of your insulin doses. You don’t have to depend on your memory or record keeping discipline when a question arises.",21d

There are 2 basic triggers.
Increase/decrease basal, or deliver a bolus correction. Sounds simple.
But there are certain parameters that can’t be user set.  For example, if trending high, it does not do correction until 160.  It will increase basal slowly, but for some, not quick enough.
When trending lower, and predicts low, it will suspend basal.  This does result in bg trending back up.  But may be more up than you want, especially if targeting A1C in 5s.   There are various tweaks to adapt to this that makes it not so simple.  There is minimal user options to set the bg settings for the triggers.  For some, the “out of the box” solution is great improvement to reduce lows and lower A1C.  But if already attaining lower A1C, it may go up.",21d
600,Injections vs insulin pumps,Type 1 and LADA,Jay6,,"@Baddog40,
I was on BIQ for a little more than a year.  I went on CIQ in January 2020 just before having open heart surgery.  Training for CIQ is a mountain in and of itself.  The best analogy is  learning to supervise the autopilot of a commercial aircraft.
I must vehemently disagree with @Laddie.  There are several things left out of the analysis she presented.
1> CIQ has hard coded levels in the software.  The levels were researched, juried, and peer reviewed by experts from the American Diabetes Association, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, & American Association of Diabetes Educators, to name a few.  The research and opinions of these and other groups lead to the establishment of the CGM levels set in the CIQ software.  Many people have expressed disdain for the values, especially the upper level of 160mg/dL before CIQ increases insulin to decrease the glucose level.
2> @Laddie, mentioned SLEEP ACTIVITY.  This is a setting within CIQ for use during sleep.  It changes the levels CIQ software is programmed to act on CGM data as well as the manner in which it acts.  Using SLEEP ACTIVITY 24/7 is outside the normal usage of the Tandem system.  The advocates of SLEEP ACTIVITY are pushing the window of their own diabetes management below the levels diabetic professionals agree upon.
3> When I started CIQ, my training was longer than most any one else shares.  Mine was two days.  The first day was with my endo’s CDE.  Day two, was with the nurse educator from Tandem.  She is the regional director for Tandem.  We still communicate.  The two educators shared the following documents and went over just about everything in them.
Here is that list of documents and their source web links.

I hope this mountain of information will give you a different perspective on Tandem’s CIQ.",20d
601,Injections vs insulin pumps,Type 1 and LADA,Robyn_H,3,"I think you misunderstand the principles of Control-IQ and for whom it was designed for.  It was designed for doctors treating the “average” type 1 who can barely achieve 50% TIR, let alone the recommended 70%, to bring them into the target zone.  It was designed for people who haven’t mastered good bolusing techniques.  And it’s really good at doing that.  Yet…  I dare you to find me a single study that declares 70% TIR is OPTIMAL.  That is a minimum target, not the end goal. It’s a balance that was struck because doctors don’t believe the common man can achieve much better without experiencing hypoglycemia.  Obviously, gluco-normalcy is optimum, but only if it can be done without increased risk.
The OP is already doing much better than the Control-IQ target audience.  Why should they, or any of us, be expected to sacrifice their current level of care to meet a lower standard?
Thankfully, Control-IQ gives me my best chance at gluco-normalcy… Just not in the way the system was intended.  I’m one of those people thriving on sleep mode.



 Jay6:

The advocates of SLEEP ACTIVITY are pushing the window of their own diabetes management below the levels diabetic professionals agree upon.


Bullcrap.  Absolute bullcrap.  Sleep mode targets a range of 110-120 mg/dl.  Well within the recommended range of 70-180.  There’s even a nice cushion built in to avoid hypos.  In fact, Tandem themselves put it out there as an option for tighter control.  They spoke about it during a Facebook live broadcast while unveiling the new software.
@Baddog40  Back to your original point.  Yes, you can achieve great results with a pump.  I daresay you might even be able to achieve better control with a pump, because you have delivery options currently unavailable to you, such as: varied basal rates throughout the day including the ability to program extra morning insulin for “dawn phenomenon” and “feet on the floor”, extended boluses for difficult high protein/fat food items, and my personal favorite… Super boluses!  Basically, this involves exploiting your pumps ability to prevent hypos by suspending your basal insulin.  You can add up to 2 hours worth of basal insulin in to a bolus dose (don’t stack them!).  This let’s you take advantage of the early peak insulin action, and instead of waiting out the long tail, that long tail essentially becomes your basal insulin, and your pump suspends everything you don’t need. It’s a miracle.  I had lasagna and bread sticks for dinner tonight, and my blood sugar ranged 97-126.  Personal victory for me!
But, as much as I love my T:slim X2 w/ Control-IQ, pumping comes at a cost.  Literally, because supplies can be expensive… But also mentally, physically, and emotionally.  Depending on the pump you choose, you’ll be living your life on a very short leash.  A 23-40 inch leash!  There’s the burden of more supplies, and traveling with spares and backups.  There’s a LOT of new information to learn, and settings to adjust.  There’s the emotional burden of alerts and alarms…
I’m only 3.5 years into pumping, so I’m still thrilled to be a cyborg.  I’m achieving the best care of my life, while feeling less burdened by my diabetes.  Many people feel the need to take a “pump break” and walk away from them for awhile, though, and wind up back on MDI.",20d
602,Injections vs insulin pumps,Type 1 and LADA,Jay6,,"As a 20+ year pumper and user of various models of Dexcom CGMs, there are some some facts absent with allusion to their veracity.  CIQ software was not designed for doctors, it was designed to integrate data & insulin administration for individuals prescribed insulin therapy and CGM monitoring.
The first set of facts missing from the discussion is the programmed parameters of the CIQ software in a Tandem X2 pump.  Yes, @Robyn_H, here is the exact statement taken from the Tandem Control-IQ handout.

The second set of facts center around a group of insulin pumping individuals who have or desire to have their RANGE measured in the area of 85-110 mg/dL.  Members of this group move openly with endocrinologist prescription to the CIQ pump and then bemoan the prevention or inability of  changing some parameters within the CIQ algorythm.
Because CIQ has hard coded some settings, like insulin duration, there is a group espousing turning CIQ off and back on to force the pump to perform certain tricks denied them in the CIQ programming.  Others want to run SLEEP ACTIVITY 24/7 because its maintains a narrower range.  It is time to present the exact CIQ set points in the Tandem pumps.

The TIR (Time in range) studies have show better clinical outcomes than individuals with tighter control.  Some pumpers, prior to using CIQ, have tweaked their settings, watch their own CGM data, and ‘Sugar Surfing’.  Sugar Surfing is a metaphor for Dynamic Diabetes Management, also known as “managing the moment”. It’s based on an awareness of one’s blood sugar trends using a continuous glucose monitoring system or by use of frequent blood glucose checks with a handheld meter. By viewing blood glucose trending, a person can make self-care choices earlier and at times more aggressively than with old-style single point in time blood sugar information. Sugar Surfing represents a paradigm shift in how all types of insulin using diabetics can be managed by individuals or involved families to maintain glucose levels at the very lowest of ‘normal levels’ so their TIR values are closer to the 85-110 instead of the WIDE norm of 70-180.
So, @Baddog40, just like faith based establishments, there are converts to different houses of worship, so are the folks using CIQ & BIQ.    Some arrived with tighter numbers & A1c values in the 5.x range wanting CIQ to keep them in their lower tighter range.  Others arrived with TIR histories resembling buckshot.  For them, the CIQ monitoring of HIGHs and LOWs was a blessing, bringing A1Cs from 13-15 down to the 6-7% range and over time to the 5.5-6.5% range (Where I am currently on basic CIQ except sleep times).
@Baddog40, is this technology for you?  Do your research, discuss it with your endo, and pump team.  Draw your own conclusion about this solution.
Again, I have been on CIQ since January 2020.  I have worn my pump thru a three hour cardiac procedure to manage a complication following open heart surgery.  As soon as I was awake, CIQ was restarted in the ICU following open heart surgery.  I am a believer.",20d

One of the main side effects of a pump is an increase in lows and an increase in the severity of lows. I, personally, couldn’t run a 5.4, but lots of people do.

The limitation of this is that short-acting insulin is still too slow to compensate quickly for many BG rises. But over time, the Tandem pump using Control IQ will deliver more insulin to try to get you back to the target ranges.
But it is not a simple plug-and-play algorithm. It can take work to find settings that work well with Control IQ. It has been a steep learning curve for endocrinologists and CDE’s in the last year just as we patients have worked to optimize settings.",20d

But my doctor is on board with my goals and supports my constant work to improve my BG numbers and to lower the burden of my diabetes.
I personally would be disappointed at a 70% time in the range of 70-180 although that would be a vast improvement for many of most people with diabetes. I am not breaking any rules to try to do better.
FYI there were people in the clinical trials for Control IQ who began using Sleep Mode 24/7 and Tandem was okay with that. In fact I learned about that option from a Tandem employee and first learned of the term “Sleeping Beauties” from her.
My understanding is that when the Medtronic 780 system is released, it will allow for more user selected targets. I have read that this system will allow patients to target a BG of 100. I think we will see the option for lower targets in future generations of Control IQ. Do I think we will see the choice to target an average BG of 83 as Dr. Bernstein recommends and some Loopers achieve? No.

607,Injections vs insulin pumps,Type 1 and LADA,DrBBType 1 or LADA,1,"As far as pumping, DP, and hybrid closed-loop pumps go:

One of the main reasons I switched to a pump was because I could NOT control my increasingly severe DP with injections. It was easy to get control of using a standard (non-loop) pump simply by setting a higher basal rate starting about 1/2 hr before DP would usually kick in, a time relatively easy to determine with a CGM. @Terry4’s comment notwithstanding, I’ve had no difficulty finding a rate that stops DP flat, and have rarely had to tweak it.
One of the main reasons I gave up on the one hybrid pump I’ve tried, the MT 670G, was because it basically ignored my DP, partly because the MT sensor didn’t pick up on it, and partly because the correction was response was so anemic, so I was consistently starting the day far higher than I had on my old, non-hybrid pump, and the 670 corrected so s-l-o-w-l-y that I ended up running a higher A1C than I had before.
The Tandem may be much better at this, since it uses the Dexcom CGM, which is more reliably accurate overnight (in my experience) than the MT Guardian 3.

 DrBB:

@Terry4’s comment notwithstanding, I’ve had no difficulty finding a rate that stops DP flat, and have rarely had to tweak it.


My comments above reflect my more recent experience of needing to make a series of adjustments to basal rates and insulin sensitivity factors to counteract a tendency to go low early in my sleep time. This battle has been going on intermittently for the last six months or so. Just when I think I’ve extinguished it for good, it makes another appearance. Last night it interrupted my sleep yet again. More tweaks this morning!
I have enjoyed periods of glucose stability around overnight and dawn phenomena events like you describe. I’ve been successfully treating a morning rise after awakening (so-called feet on the floor syndrome) with one 4-unit Afrezza inhalation but my insurance coverage for that was lost.
That caused me to experiment with an approximate 2-unit pre-emptive pump dose when I get out of bed. This has worked extremely well. Of course, this could be easily done with an injection as well.",18d

My experience was being on MDI for 20 years with good control but overwhelming hypoglycemia. The earliest pumps helped a little since I no longer had the confusion of mixed insulin injections. The introduction of Dexcom CGM was much more helpful in preventing hypoglycemia and I could manage my glucose well during the day but was “on call” to the Dexcom alarms all night. Six months ago I switched to Tandem with Control IQ. I’m 70 years old and not particularly tech savvy but was able to set it up in twenty minutes after watching the you tube videos. The result has been completely satisfactory. I am on a low carb diet and now have an A1C of 5.9 which is about the same as the past 30 years but my time in range is now 94% with no serious hypoglycemia and I get to sleep through the night without any alarms and actually had the alarm go off once because I had not touched the pump for 12 hours.

When you are doing everything right and things don’t make sense you could be a misdiagnosed type 1 and not a type 2, 40% of type 1’s are misdiagnosed as a type 2 at first. I was for over 8 years.
If things keep not making sense you might request further lab work. First an Antibody Test. A positive is a sign you are a type 1, but some type 1’s test negative but don’t make insulin and they don’t know why. And a C-peptide Test which tells how much insulin you are producing. A low or low normal is a sign of being a type 1. High or high normal is a sign of being a type 2. A type 2 still produces insulin but usually at a higher level because they aren’t utilizing it properly and the body tries to make more to make up for it.
Diets changes and medication can work at first because as a type 1 you still make some insulin for a while.

A decrease in your blood glucose levels does not cause the amount of glycated hemoglobin in your blood to drop immediately. It takes a period of time for this to happen which is why the A1c is viewed as an indicator of “average” blood glucose.
However, this also means that if the tests are too close together, you may not see any change.  My understanding is that a period of at least three months is recommended between consecutive tests.

So what can I tell you about your results, firstly that it didn’t go up. That is great news. Now you got to start breaking down how you are living. I do this by dividing my diabetic life into 3… 1) Food intake 2)Medicine Intake and 3) Exercise. I’ve been playing around with these 3 for more than 10 years now. And it changes all the time because we get older and also T2 changes with time. I can give you clues of what to look for but I can never be certain where you should look or change. But maybe look at your blood sugar 2 hours after eating. Good luck. BTW after more than 10 years my A1c has just returned to 6 for the 3rd time - it’s been floating between 6 and 7 all this time.",Dec '20

626,No change in A1c,Type 2,JamesIgoe,1,"Some people have mentioned this, but as humans, we want to see our good side, so we look in the flattering mirror. Maybe this is the reason for the seemingly better numbers, you are testing when your BS is better. To counteract our own bias, you should aim for consistency, and test for better control. From studies I have read, the best time to test is 60 to 90 minutes after your meal. Even better, test when you eat, and test 90 minutes afterward. Since your meal composition, and the highs created by it, are what you want to manage.
As for reducing those peaks, focus on tasty low-glycemic index food, in smaller amounts, so instead of 2 big meals, 4 little ones, or even 5 little ones.
As for bringing the numbers down in general, try exercise, or exercise more, or exercise better. Exercise is key to increasing your insulin sensitivity, and that will help your native insulin function better to bring down your A1c.
If any of this sounds like it might help, ask, and I can expand/explain more.",Dec '20

I have observed it doesn’t always sit exactly the same for every single insertion, sometimes it does sit up than others.
When you push it down and comes back up, that is the stiffness of the not-quite-entirely-inserted sensor wire.

If the wire is only partially in it lies flat, so I assume you will have a decent run on this one.


ah so it gives a bit of a tug when its fully inserted so that the component flaps up?  I was a bit worried because I know the part that goes into the skin is sensitive and the part was flapping up and down i could see what tugging on the sensor needle bit and was concerned I was causing it damage.
Out of curiosity what is the correct way to insert the sensor to get the best results.

The big why?  Presumably something new offers some improvement over something pre-existing rather than merely new avenues for the income stream for the manufacturer. Apparently the peak is earlier with Lyumjev compared to other lispro so Lyumjev works right away.

674,"Rumination, a mindless route to unhappiness",Mental and Emotional Wellness,Terry4,2,"One definition of rumination that I found:

The process of continuously thinking about the same thoughts, which tend to be sad or dark,  is  called  rumination . A habit of  rumination can be dangerous to your mental health, as it can prolong or intensify depression as well as impair your ability to think and process emotions.

I realize that this bad habit is not limited to people with diabetes but I think it makes our challenge with diabetes even more difficult. I wish I was aware of this self-defeating behavior when I was much younger and traversing a particularly rough patch involving divorce and betrayal compounded with engaging in a losing legal battle to prevent my young child’s move far away from me. I lost 10 years of my life dominated by this bad way of thinking.
I am a person with strong cognitive skills and find this ability especially useful in many aspects of my life. Unfortunately, it also makes me susceptible to replaying events over and over with no off-ramp. It could be called analysis paralysis. I wish I had better emotional intelligence during that time as I seemed intent on learning things the hard way.
I did slowly learn some tactics that helped but wished I had been more focussed on treating this insidious habit with persistent antidotes. What are those antidotes?
One of the best tactics for me was communicating my perceived troubles with a caring listener, both friends and professionals. I think however, that one tactic is not enough to counteract this bad habit. A fabric of interwoven tactics works better.
I found that writing, as in a journal, an effective technique. The saying, “onto paper, off of your mind,” describes breaking this vicious circle.
I discovered that physical exercise could distract me from my problems, but again, it was not enough to neutralize my self-defeating behavior.
One thing that didn’t work was a belief that all I needed was some transforming cathartic event that would, once and for all, relieve me of this ineffective and painful thought process. In divorce situations, I think that this illogical conclusion traps many into making premature romantic relationships likely doomed to failure. I was lucky enough to avoid this particular trap.
In the last few years, I’ve adopted a meditation habit that I think would have been a potent tactic to break the rumination trap. It’s effective but not a quick fix, however.
Anyway, you get the idea. Do you observe this self-defeating behavior in yourself? What immediate tactics work for you to break this cycle and what things have you adopted in the long-run to defeat rumination?",Nov '20

681,Medical Supply Companies,Type 1 and LADA,Terry4,3,"I’m on Medicare with a private insurance supplement plan. I had been using Byram for my Dexcom supplies but their policy was to only ship monthly. For me, every 30-day shipment date was delayed due to a revolving set of reasons.
These delays were only about a few days but Byram indexed the next shipment opportunity based on the last delayed shipment date. When I raised the issue of “calendar creep,” the customer service rep didn’t seem to understand that this practice would soon lead to me living without Dexcom supplies. They didn’t seem to appreciate the importance of CGM use to my health and safety.
I switched to US Med and now receive a 90-day supply, nine sensors and one transmitter, every 90 days, like clockwork. I’ve now received three shipment from them, all on time. The last shipment I received arrived 89 days after the prior one. I only had to respond to one email per shipment to trigger each delivery.
With Byram, I suffered making multiple phone calls to them, forced to navigate their patience-eroding phone menu, and often told that they needed paperwork from my doctor that I later confirmed had already been sent. Byram was hyper-focussed on getting paid while my needs as a Medicare customer who depended on timely shipments seemed unimportant to them.

705,Insulin coverage on Medicare Part B … another gotcha at least at CVS,Type 1 and LADA,John_S2,,"@Don1942:
I think that the short answer is that: “It depends … on a lot of things.”
Note: all of this part B stuff is only for insulin that is used in pumps that are classified as DME (Durable Medical Equipment) under Medicare and not for normal insulin vials or pens used for MDI.  To complicate things, I understand that an Omnipod can either be DME or non-DME.
If you DO have a pump that is DME, then the insulin that it is used is SUPPOSED to be set up with a CPT part B code.  As near as I can tell, however, 90-95% of folks using a DME pump, still get their insulin under their Part D (Prescription) plan … even though that is technically wrong.
If I am not mistaken, Medicare part B is supposed to cover 80% of the Medicare-allowed cost of a 30 day supply of insulin.  (after, I think, a $195 annual part B deductible).
Some of the factors to consider include:
How good is your Medicare supplement plan?  Will it cover some or all of the non-covered 20%?  Will it cover your part B deductible?
Is your insulin of choice in the formulary?
How much insulin will you get for a 30-day supply?
Do you need to fill your prescription at more than one location? (Easy with a part D prescription … impossible with a part B insulin prescription).
Note: I think that everyone’s numbers are likely different and for some people, living with the Part D co-pay MAY BE cheaper than doing it the proper way … but, for SOME PEOPLE, their Part B insulin is actually free.
This probably takes some homework … and you may not want to ask your pharmacist if you already have a pretty good co-pay deal under Part D because going the Part B route may actually be more expensive.
After I have a chance … and after I pour myself a glass of wine because this stuff is crazy-making … I will try to post some of my specific numbers as an example.  However, my numbers are simply my costs and calculations and your costs and calculations will likely be different than mine.

But the 780G is supposed to fix the one thing that made the 670 a failure for me and many others, namely that the target BG for the algorithm was fixed at 120. This resulted in A1C’s in the neighborhood of 6.9 (per their own FAQ), which was no good for those of us with much tighter control than that (though people habitually running >7 generally liked it). The 780 by contrast will allow you to set the target as low as 100, which should make it much more responsive in correcting highs and allow you to achieve results more like those of us who are used to getting high-5/low-6 A1Cs.
Re the Guardian sensor system and all that annoying over-taping crap: that’s also supposed to be done away with in their next version. So yay. I think it’s supposed to also get rid of the 2x/day calibration requirement but don’t quote me on that.
Of course if they really had a sudden attack of sanity they could ditch their kludgy CGM system entirely and just open compatibility with Dexcom.

To get a pump system covered under Medicare, the pump must NOT require daily calibrations for meals and other actions . Medicare qualified the Tandem with g6 sensor, but not the 770 with Guardian. Why? Because FDA never approved Medtronic’s pump for use without needing calibrations for routine daily activities.

If worse comes to worse I can always go back to using dexcom until Medtronic updates their sensors.

742,Diabetes + COVID vaccines: what you need to know,COVID-19,MilaStaff,1,"WRITTEN BY: LALA JACKSON
Editor’s Note: We have a simple goal: tap into the power of the global diabetes community to save lives.  Learn more about what you can do as a person with diabetes 1 to keep yourself and others safe from COVID-19 until we’re all safe.
This article was last updated Monday, December 7, 2020.
Following a recent outpouring of positive clinical trial news, COVID-19 vaccines are coming soon. The upcoming vaccine roll-out has left many with questions about timing, safety, and what to expect – particularly those with diabetes or other underlying health concerns.
Here’s what you need to know about the COVID-19 vaccines on the way:
WHAT VACCINES ARE THESE?
In November, Pfizer and BioNTech announced positive results from the conclusion of their COVID vaccine clinical trials, quickly followed by Moderna. Each is in the process of receiving FDA approval in the United States, with emergency approval meetings happening for each in mid-December.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines went through the standard three phases of clinical trials – Phase 1, where it is administered to a small number of people to show initial safety, Phase 2 to hundreds of people split into groups by things like age and background to show how different types of people react to the vaccine, then Phase 3, in which it is given to tens of thousands of people, tested against a placebo. Because of the speed needed for development, both vaccines were approved to go through animal clinical trials at the same time as human Phase 1 clinical trials.
To be approved, the FDA requires the vaccine work in at least half of those who receive it. For both vaccines currently undergoing emergency FDA approval, early analysis from the National Institutes of Health independent data review board (DSMB) saw that 94-95% of those who received the vaccine in the trials became immune to the coronavirus.
Both of these frontrunner vaccines are mRNA vaccines, a type of immunization that does not use a whole virus but instead employs a piece of genetic material to create antibodies against the novel coronavirus. Each vaccine requires two doses, given three to four weeks apart.
Other vaccines – different types of immunizations made by multiple companies – are currently in clinical trials with results expected early (and throughout) 2021. 58 different vaccines are currently going through human clinical trials; in any trial where participants exhibit worrisome symptoms, the trial is paused and cannot proceed until any issues are corrected.
DO COVID VACCINES AND DIABETES MIX WELL?
Some clinical trial participants have reported mild side effects of the vaccines, much like how some people experience injection-site soreness, mild lethargy, a low-grade fever after other vaccines. Important to note – none of the vaccines undergoing approval in the US have any strain of the real coronavirus in them, so it is not possible to get COVID-19 from the vaccines themselves.
These mild reactions some people experience after vaccines are typical and not cause for alarm – they are a result of the immune system going into action as purposely triggered by the vaccine, creating the ability to fight against the actual virus were a person to be exposed to it.
Because of the mild symptoms experienced by some, it is important to stay vigilant about blood sugar levels for the first 24 to 48 hours after receiving the vaccine. The symptoms may impact your BG, so check your levels frequently, stay hydrated, and be familiar with your sick day routine 1. The mild symptoms you may experience after the vaccine are significantly safer and more easily managed than potentially getting the novel coronavirus itself.
As we currently understand, you are not more at risk to catch the novel coronavirus if you have diabetes, but if you do catch the virus, you may be more at risk for more severe complications from COVID-19, particularly if you have been experiencing consistently elevated blood sugar levels.
If you have specific concerns or worries, make sure you speak to a healthcare provider you trust (or keep tuning into Beyond Type 1 coverage of COVID-19 to hear from the healthcare providers we trust).
GREAT, WHEN CAN I GET MINE?
When you will get access to a COVID-19 vaccine depends on where you live, what you do for work, and your risk-level for acquiring or experiencing severe symptoms of COVID-19. People with diabetes are considered to have COVID-related health-risks 1. Many countries across the world will not be getting enough vaccines for their population for at least a couple years. Other countries – like the US and UK – have already invested in large amounts of vaccines, with more coming quickly over the next months and year. The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will be considering emergency approval for each of the initial vaccines in mid-December.
If you live in the US, this NY Times Calculator 8 will provide an idea of your “place in line” to get access to the COVID-19 vaccine. As voted upon by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, healthcare workers and nursing home residents will be prioritized first, with up to 24 million likely receiving their vaccine in December 2020, followed by other essential workers, including first responders and teachers, in early 2021, dependent upon FDA approval.
People who are not essential workers but live with COVID-related health risks – like those over the age of 65 and/or with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity or other immunocompromising conditions – may be able to receive the vaccine in early to late spring. All others – those who are otherwise healthy and children (as clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine in children are just starting) – will likely need to wait until late spring, summer, or into the fall.
In the US, vaccines will be free, with the federal government paying the vaccine developers directly. They will likely be available in many of the places flu shots are typically distributed – drug store and grocery pharmacies, medical offices, and possibly school clinics. The timeline for each of the vaccines is dependent on FDA approvals, followed by funding for distribution and logistics set up in each state.
STILL HAVE CONCERNS?
Individuals have expressed some hesitation to personal vaccination for COVID-19. This is an understandable feeling – vaccines do not typically make it through development and approval this quickly. Particularly for Black, brown, and indigenous people in the United States and across many places in the world, deep-rooted medical racism and exploitative medical experimentation, including with past vaccines like the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, has led to understandable distrust in vaccine administration and the healthcare system at large.
Here’s what we know:


The speed with which the vaccines were developed was unprecedented. However, the clinical trials these vaccines had to go through were strict and the reporting of their safety and efficacy had to be unequivocally proven and replicated. Three phases of clinical trials, including a Phase 3 with tens of thousands of participants, had to prove safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. Phase 3 of the clinical trials were also double-blind, meaning neither the trial participants nor the company that created the vaccine knew if participants were receiving the vaccine or a placebo. Data was reviewed by the National Institutes of Health independent data review board, and final approval for the vaccines must be provided by the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, composed of scientists who have no ties to the companies by which the vaccines were produced.


Black, Native, and Latinx communities have been hit hardest by COVID-19 because of systemic and medical racism, with Black Americans dying from COVID-19 at twice the rate of white Americans. Ensuring equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is vital to work against the deep impact of systemic and medical racism, but this must be coupled with understanding distrust due to violent medical racism throughout the US’s history.


We don’t know for sure what percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity, but we do know that the more people who are immune to carrying or spreading the virus, the better. Those who are willing and able to take the vaccine are helping to protect everyone in their community.


If, after doing research from reputable, science-based sources (we recommend science communicators like Jessica Malty Rivera for easy-to-digest and accurate information), you are still not comfortable taking the vaccine as it becomes available to you, continue to practice safe health measures to protect yourself and others from the novel coronavirus 1. Until the majority of the population is vaccinated, we cannot rely on herd immunity. We must keep those most vulnerable among us safe until we’re all safe, practicing simple actions like wearing a mask and social distancing to do so.


2020 has been hard; at many times, scary and filled with grief. Working toward getting our communities safe and healthy is important for a multitude of reasons, and will take a united effort. Ensuring you have a plan for when you will get vaccinated once you can is vital to keep yourself and those most vulnerable among us safe until we’re all safe.",Dec '20
743,Diabetes + COVID vaccines: what you need to know,COVID-19,John58Type 1 or LADA,,"I’d like to toss a few concerns out there which have not been publicized. First of all, if your state follows the CDC guidelines, Type 2 diabetes will put you in line ahead of the generally healthy people. Type 1 diabetes will not, you will not have priority for the vaccine, unless you have other conditions. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html 2
Second of all, I have not found any clarification about the age cutoff of 65 for priority. All through the pandemic we were shown statistics indicating a higher risk of hospitalization starting at age 60, not 65.
Thirdly, many states have expanded the list of “essential workers” to include tech workers, bankers, real estate etc. As I understand the vaccine prioritization here in WA (based on their draft policy) a 64 year old Type 1 diabetic will be in line with 29 year old bankers and tech workers (who are working from home), probably late spring 2021.
Does that seem right to anybody?",Dec '20
744,Diabetes + COVID vaccines: what you need to know,COVID-19,ChrisP,,"It’s odd that it specifically list type 2.
Also “essential workers” it seems like half the country is essential.
A couple months ago we had a lock down in my county. Almost everything was still open.
I was consider an essential worker and I’m a programer. In my case I can work from home but I was technically allowed to go into work being “essential”.
When it comes to vaccines while I want one asap, I hope someone like me isn’t really consider as “essential worker” as hospital workers, paramedics, teachers etc…
It’s going to be tough to get all these vaccines out as fast as possible. The most important thing is to get it in as many people as possible, that will eventually start slowing the spread and make us all safer.
Better to be quick getting people vacated then spend more time figuring out what is more fare/optimal.
They did have 10ish months to think about and plan for that though.",Dec '20
745,Diabetes + COVID vaccines: what you need to know,COVID-19,cardamom,,"The T1 thing makes sense (said as a T1 diabetic). Type 2s are clearly at increased risk—at this point, the research doesn’t conclusively suggest T1s have the same risk, so that’s what I’ve been expecting for a while now (and have said elsewhere on this thread). It is entirely appropriate and accurate to classify T1 as “might” be at increased risk. Lots of things people think might qualify them as higher risk are in that category, like asthma, taking immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune disorders, etc, because the data just hasn’t shown those to be conclusively linked to risk. The conditions listed in the highest risk category are the ones with overwhelming evidence. IMO, they should use those two tiers in those orders, since that’s the best evidence-informed practice.",Dec '20
746,Diabetes + COVID vaccines: what you need to know,COVID-19,John58Type 1 or LADA,,"I am fine with “might be” at risk being behind “significant” risk.
On a personal level, risk mitigation is the overall goal of vaccination and a “might” person could have good reason to want or need to mitigate that risk by getting vaccinated. Not sure about the other 63 year old Type 1’s out there, but I have been hunkered down for 8 months in order to mitigate that risk. On a personal level, and in consultation with my endo, “might be” was enough to hunker down. Now we are told that “might be” is not enough to get priority for the vaccine.
I am not fine with the lack of gradations to the prioritization below age 65. I believe the cutoff age of 65 is arbitrary.
In WA it appears that a 64 year old Type 1 is going to be at equal priority or possibly behind a 29 year old “essential” banker or tech worker. Despite the clear evidence that hospitalization and etc. risk are much greater for any 64 year old. And despite the fact that Type 1 “might” further increase that risk. And despite the fact that many of the “essential” workers are and will continue to be working from home.
I know it’s hard for the powers that be to inject a more gradational prioritization into this but I think they went too far in the opposite direction.",30d

748,Diabetes + COVID vaccines: what you need to know,COVID-19,MM1,,"I think if T1 (or T2) is hospitalized with COVID, part of the problem is that many hospitals want to administer all meds, including insulin.

But if your health deteriorates, they will likely take over, using injections even if you’re on pump.",28d

 greymore:

I think medicare plans differ, especially Advantage plans.  Since strips are no longer “bundled” (as with G5, thus covered as DME), some get strips covered as RX/Part D plan.  But usually with additional notes from doctor and documented logs turned in.  Doctor may note that in your case, the numbers are not accurate at all times, and you may have symptoms of pending lows/highs that don’t match dexcom.  Thus BG checks are required.",3d

755,Dex6 VS strips,Type 1 and LADA,Jane_Vaugh,2,"I’ve been on the Medtronic system for years and always needed strips but with insurance the Contour strips were too expensive so I bought them out of pocket on Amazon. Now on Medicare and a Medigap plan, thus far I’ve gotten 3 orders of Contour strips. I’ve had the Dexcom G6 for a few months and just got my TSlim pump with Control IQ. With the G6 I might calibrate once after inserting a new sensor and that usually straightens the sensors out for the remaining 10 days. I’m not exactly sure if I can get my strips refilled again but I have enough boxes to hold me quite a long time because I’ve always hoarded supplies. I’m so incredibly tired of finger sticks for the last 30 years. This morning with the G6 and TSlim Control IQ, I don’t have to calibrate before my morning bolus. That’s the first time since I started using a pump 21 years ago! It is so very sweet! Hallelujah!",2d
756,Dex6 VS strips,Type 1 and LADA,ChrisP,2,"Probably 5 out of 7 days a week I don’t use blood meter at all. Sometimes if I see a high or low that I’m not sure about I’ll double check with a finger stick. Also the first day I put on a new Dexcom sensor I might double check numbers that are suspect.
I always carry my blood meter with me or in the car just in case I need it but Dexcom is what I use for 99% of my decisions.
Before Dexcom I was using 10 strips per-day (new type 1). I hated never feeling like I knew if it was OK sugar wise. Having constant readings from Dexcom has been the best life improvement since diagnosis.
My insurance covers dexcom with prior auth paper work from Endo. They also cover 4 strips per-day.
I think its criminal that without a CGM 4 readings per-day is considered enough.",2d
757,Dex6 VS strips,Type 1 and LADA,John70,,"It’s not that I don’t trust the Dexcom. But I still use my meter a couple times a day and recalibrate the Dexcom.
Reading between the two some times meet exactly ,other times it will very +/-  20-30 points.At this time it’s just a personal thing to me.
But however you handle it.  Check it it with your Endo Doc.",2d
758,Dex6 VS strips,Type 1 and LADA,greymore,,"Wow thanks lots everyone. I never thought of amazon. I use contour next strips and don’t need many as the dex6
is pretty accurate. I hoard these supplies too and finally went through all the ones I had when using the dex5. I sure don’t miss finger sticks
and life is better with the dexcom as I am prone to lows and can’t always tell.",2d
759,Dex6 VS strips,Type 1 and LADA,ChrisP,1,"Early on with the Dexcom I would calibrate but after a few years I have a different opinion.
I think calibrations should be avoided.

The first day of a new sensor don’t calibrate at all
Don’t calibrate unless the dexcom is consistently off by the same amount in the same direction.
If the dexcom is on average off by 10 or less its not worth calibration

Example Dexcom is reading around 20 high all the time compared to meter.
Because the Dexcom is using an algorithm and projecting your blood sugar when you have fast rises and fast falls its more likely to be off. When your sugar is level its more likely to be accurate.
Extra calibrations actually lead to getting worse results from the dexcom.
If your dexcom is off by more then 50 points more than a few times I would request a new sensor.
This is just based on my experience, maybe others have witness different trends in the meter vs dexcom results.",2d
760,Dex6 VS strips,Type 1 and LADA,greymore,,"I agree. I seldom calibrate the dex6. Over operating gets things swinging. It seems that the dex6 is slower to respond
to corrections. Last night it woke me with a low alarm and I did 15 grams of carbs but it didn’t turn for quite awhile and I
went back to bed. I checked with the Bayer and there was about a 20 point difference. No calibration needed.",2d

Had another GD diagnosis at 25, again controlled with diet. Stayed around 165lbs then got a prediabetes diagnosis at 28, I’m 29 now. I have since lost 25lbs and test my blood sugar daily.

811,Should I be worried about LADA? Please help,Type 1 and LADA,cardamom,7,"Nothing about what you’re describing sounds particularly like LADA vs T2 to me. I’d wager a guess that you’re prediabetic/early stage T2, especially if you’ve got a family history of T2. Alcohol inhibits the liver’s release of glycogen (glucose store) so if your body doesn’t alter its insulin response effectively, it could make you hypo. Same thing with exercise—if your body is over producing insulin (which it tends to with insulin resistance, i.e., Type 2), it might not dial that back enough to prevent a hypo. You can certainly ask for more tests to be done like c-peptide and antibodies, but right now, if I were you, I’d focus on learning what you need to do to keep your blood sugars in a good range (like eating a snack before exercise, eating with and testing after drinking and/or minimizing drinking) and know that however your diabetes does or doesn’t develop, that’s what it will be like—figuring what works and going with it. It will be ok no matter what!!",16d

813,Should I be worried about LADA? Please help,Type 1 and LADA,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,3,"Having GD in the past seems to be one of the precursors/signs to getting diabetes later, but usually it’s type2. Also having hypos without taking insulin is also a sign of  type 2.  A lot of type 2’s have hypoglycemia before they get full blown diabetes.
Type 1’s lack insulin so they go too high and usually remain too high before they start on insulin. Although there are a few few variations of diabetes out there. To know if you are a type 1 you would need a antibody test, which if positive means you are a type 1, although there are some type 1’s out there that don’t have the antibodies but don’t make insulin. And a C-peptide that tells you how much insulin you are making. Low or low normal is a sign of type 1, high or high normal is a sign of type 2.
But what you are describing fits type 2 more. A type 1 lacks insulin and LADA is a type 1. It’s just a term used to describe slower onset type 1 . What happens with LADA/type 1 is you stop slowly making insulin over time until you completely stop. That muddies the waters and helps cause LADA/type 1’s often to be misdiagnosed. What happens with a type 2 is they still make insulin, they just don’t use it well. A type 1 loses weight because they can’t utilize the food they eat because they lack insulin to do so. A type 2 is more prone to gain weight until they get their blood sugars in better control, then they can lose weight.
It’s important as a type 2 to keep your blood sugars stable, that usually means smaller meals and watching what you eat. Proper snacks in between meals can help that. But as soon as you eat something sugary your blood sugars will shoot up because as a type 2 your insulin isn’t working well, it’s called insulin resistance. But eventually it usually does work and your blood sugars drop back down to more normal ranges.
People use exercise to help bring down their blood sugars because it helps force glucose into the cells to be used. Taking walks after you eat actually helps a lot of type 1’s and type 2’s. If you are dropping because of exercise that means exercise is being very effective in what it’s doing. So either change the timing of your exercise for right after you eat or eat a protein snack, maybe a few complex carbs a half hour or so before to help stabilize your blood sugars.",16d
814,Should I be worried about LADA? Please help,Type 1 and LADA,Terry4,2,"I wouldn’t worry about whether you will be diagnosed with LADA or not. But I would aggressively pursue getting a correct diagnosis. The C-peptide and antibody tests should help clarify.
While I am a LADA T1D, I don’t buy into the idea that one type of diabetes is worse than another. They’re all tough to live with and if you don’t treat them well, unless you’re very lucky, long-term complications will creep in.
T1D can require closer attention to your health but that has some benefits, too. Either way, you can live a long and happy life with either form of diabetes. But you do need to take care of business and not fall into a denial trap.
In the year before I was diagnosed with T1D, I experienced several episodes of reactive hypoglycemia. They occurred following a highly processed breakfast cereal, milk and fruit breakfast. After a few hours, I went low, felt shaky, sweaty, and irritable. When I ate a candy bar, everything felt better.



 stefjonge:

I was at 58 after 30 minutes of a pretty rigorous workout, I didn’t eat directly before using the bike, but had a low carb meal about three hours before.


This looks like a reactive hypoglycemia episode to me, compounded by your rigorous workout.
Reactive hypoglycemia is not definitive for T2D and can be a symptom of T1D with a slow onset or LADA. Many doctors miss this diagnosis and sometimes are reluctant to do the C-peptide and anti-body tests. There are several antibody tests and just because you may test negative for the most common GAD-65 antibody does not rule out T1D.
Good luck. Push to find out what kind of diabetes you’re living with, learn as much as you can about its treatment and then take action!

815,Should I be worried about LADA? Please help,Type 1 and LADA,Marypat,1,"I agree with Terry4.  It sounds like reactive hypoglycemia.  Before my LADA diagnosis in 2008 I spent years in a cycle of reactive hypos a couple hours after a high sugar / fast carb snack or meal followed by another food frenzy to to counter the lows.
I also had GD with my second pregnancy, followed the diabetes diet while I was pregnant and then spent years making up in extra carbs for the few months I ate low carb while I was pregnant.  I gained about 30 lbs over the next 20 years, but I did not care at the time.  When I experienced vision problems in 2005, I was misdiagnosed as a Type 2.  And it took a couple more years of a low carb diet and exercise, before a sharp nurse practitioner ordered the GAD65 antibody test to diagnose LADA.
My message is to take care of yourself. Don’t give up on exercise, but always have some fast carbs / glucose tabs available if you have a hypo.  Eat and drink in moderation.  It may take some time before you get a correct diagnosis - if any.  However, be aware that there are a plenty of doctors who do not understand LADA.  Even my first endocrinologist got it wrong.
Worry and stress will likely make everything worse.  Be aware of your situation and try -one day at a time- to make good (or better) decisions about diet and exercise.",16d

822,How do you sustain long-term motivation against Covid-19?,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Terry4,7,"As I write this, I’ve read many recent reports of a worrying rise in Covid-19 infections all around the world. We’ve been at this project for many months now. Many of us radically changed our social interactions motivated by the reasonable fear we felt about the virus driving this pandemic.
In the Northern Hemisphere we enter the dark winter months, a time when viruses find ideal environments for transmission: holiday parties, heated low-humidity conditions, and minimal ventilation. The siren song of cultural customs and tradition entice us to relax our vigilance. “It’ll just be this one-time; I’ve otherwise been disciplined and deserve this social respite,” we rationalize.
I’ve read many accounts reasoning that depriving ourselves of our usual social interaction is bad for our mental and emotional health. I feel this persuasive tug yet always come to the overwhelming conclusion that life and death risks legitimately over-ride my mental and emotional health status.
Besides, there are tactics that can mitigate the damage to our social lives. While they may not be as satisfying as face-to-face human interaction that we crave, phone calls, Zoom meetings, and written communication can help us safely survive.
All of us here share diabetes as a life-long health burden. We all understand the long-term challenge of diabetes. It is a marathon, not a sprint. In that way we have all been forced to create skills that can sustain us over the long run. I’ve found this to help me keep my eye on the prize when it comes to Covid-19.
The recent news of promising vaccines does indicate that we may be nearing better times. I think we will find that things will get better for us in 2021. The first quarter should see vaccine deployment in the front-line health care workers while the second quarter may very well witness vaccines for the vulnerable population of which we are a part. Of course, uncertainty remains high and we all need to calibrate our hopes against reality.
I’m an introvert, so I know the social concessions I’ve made are easier for me than it is for extroverts. I’ve found phone conversations with my close family can sustain my mental and emotional health in a reasonable balance. I’ve paid attention to my nutrition and exercise routines as well.
I have made deliberate and considered concessions to increased risks of several in-person medical appointments: cataract surgeries, dental visits, and a few blood draws. Except for the dental appointments, all parties were wearing masks. I also visit the grocery store about once per week but do so during off-hours with a targeted list that minimizes my time in the store. My grocery store now has complete compliance with mask-wearing, a condition not present last spring.
I believe that I’ve been able to balance the added risk and keep it to a reasonable level. This is not something that we can measure but simply a judgment that we each can make.
How do you feel you’ve been managing the long-term nature of surviving Covid-19? Have you compromised with your social preferences, especially with the usual holiday celebrations. I declined an in-person holiday meal invitation from my adult daughter; she understood and only raised the topic to solicit my position.
I think we’re getting closer to the end of the challenge and I encourage everyone to not lose sight of the real goal - surviving to a better day. I fear the decimating action of Covid-19 in the next 90 days or so. We should not let our guard down now! The end of this pandemic is in sight.",Nov '20
823,How do you sustain long-term motivation against Covid-19?,Mental and Emotional Wellness,JamesIgoe,4,"Maybe this why I work as a software developer, but I am engaged by things on my computers, so sites I regularly go through, plus things to take care of, and since it was always this way, it hasn’t changed as much for me as it has for people that are highly social. Once everything is done, and I wrap up, I usually spend time with my spouse, in a routine, having dinner, watching obscure foreign quiz shows and Swedish noir, as the consistency can help reduce anxiety.
Also, I’ve long been fitness-oriented, so the rowing machine I bought for the pandemic helps, as does living in a condo with a park and playground, where I can take pleasant walks and play basketball. Also, at least once a week I take mini-hikes around Manhattan, from 5 to 7 miles, through the distinct neighborhoods.
My wife is more social than I am, although more introverted, and she arranges a couple of Zooms with friends that I attend, and she then also attends numerous online meetings for The New York Society for Ethical Culture she is part with her mother. Nicely, the pandemic has made her more tolerant and less impatient.
As for my health, I lost weight initially, and now back to my usual, but my health hasn’t suffered at all, and in fact, is better, as I mostly take care of myself, my environment is very controlled, doctors do the prescribing, and little has changed. That said, I do have a few minor issues that I will see someone for, slowly advancing Dupuytren’s contracture and mild RA in the other hand.
The things I no longer have and have no realistic replacement:

Weekly dinner out with family
Cultural events, like Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall
Museums, the biggest loss for me, and although I can attend a few easily, like The Met Museum and MoMa, I have not yet
Time at the gym, the long hikes, and the museums were often combined into outings done on one day over weekends, making the other just a workout day, so that has been disruptive, but in truth, although I miss them, I am happy regardless

The upsides:

Time spent in training courses, and although work-related, gratifying
Better diet and A1c

I shared this on LinkedIn recently just after Pfizer announced it prelim results:
Even with a vaccine, there are still going to be months of physical isolation, and this provides some ideas to get through, like routine, optimism, micro-goals, and more…

Thank you for your thoughts. I’ll add a bit of my own perspective:
What do I miss the most: opera and travel … and the social elements of each.
I try to remind myself every day how lucky I am during this pandemic.
In particular, as a retiree I can easily limit my daily interactions. Plus, suddenly “fixed income” is like Nirvana … whereas a year ago it was almost cause for pity.
The dog and I go for 3 nice, long walks per day totaling 8-12 miles in a low density area with little traffic. On most of those walks, I’m no closer than 30-50 feet from of other people … but have my mask on the entire time. The dog is in charge of route that frees me to think or just enjoy being outdoors.
I’ve got a brother and a close friend that are on oxygen if they are not sitting down. I’m thankful that I’m not in an equally precarious situation.
While grocery shopping is probably the scariest thing I have to do, I find that takeout meals are a great comfort. Far better than I can prepare for myself, virtually zero contact for me or, equally important, the much higher risk restaurant staff. Plus, I know that I’m helping a small business stay afloat during these challenging times.
I do keep an eye on Covid data at the county, State, US, and world level and every few days download some data to look at a few things for myself. It helps me to better deal with much of the (politically motivated) noise out there.
I keep planning travel, even though it may have to be cancelled. For me, having something to look forward to is more beneficial than the disappointment if it has to be cancelled.
Enough from me …

I don’t go to the doctor, dentist, or even get labs done while isolated. I know what my A1c will be because it seldom changes much, so I don’t need a lab for those results.  CJ114 helped me figure out how to order a cholesterol tester from China, so I can test my lipid levels at home.  I have stents so it is important that my LDL levels stay as low as I can get them. I can’t take statins or the newer injections due to severe side effects. In a last ditch effort my cardiologist suggested I take a supplement he had heard about which might lower my LDL 10%. I am thrilled to share that my LDL level dropped from 114 down to 47. My husband tested his cholesterol too and his was quite close to his lab results from March 2020. I realize that we aren’t sure if LDL levels are important, but I have probably seen 7 or 8 cardiologists in the last 10 yrs, and they all think it is.
I must say that I am feeling the pull of the holidays. Our son lives 1/2 hr away and we message daily and video chat now and then. We have seen him about 3 times from a distance. I sure would like to hug him, but we won’t until we are convinced it is safe to do so. My husband and I will celebrate the holidays alone and will do our best to have a good time.
Like Jameslgoe, my husband and I have a routine of eating dinner together and watching TV in the evenings. It is something we look forward to every night. It is good to hear that this is helpful.
We get our groceries delivered and we pick up our prescriptions in the parking lot of the pharmacy we use. We rarely see anyone, but a neighbor from a distance occasionally. We talk with and email friends. I will be glad when this is over, but it will be a long time until I will feel safe.
What do I miss? Our 15 1/2 yr old dog, who died in June. We were able to adopt a cat who was being fostered by a friend, so we have a pet to love again. I miss traveling to big cities and going to art galleries, museums and just seeing different people. I miss the trip to Europe that we were going to go on to celebrate our 50th last June. I hope that someday we will be able to get on a plane again. We shall see. At this point I would be happy if I could just get my hair cut.",Nov '20

Clean up and rearrange, remove the clutter the has accumulated more than usual. I find this cathartic.


Buff up one’s online presence for work, since time is now less personal and wholly remote, I’ve started taking online courses that result in badges and certifications. I’ve always enjoyed learning, but I’ve come to feel that it isn’t appreciated unless visible to others, hence the focus on a tangible result. This could also be an effect of the medical environment I work in, with a focus on certifications and degrees, as opposed to finance


Improve one’s social interactions online, so sharing and responding better to others.


Although we now spend much less, without travel, dinners out, work lunches, and clothing, I have spent a bit more on making my computer space nicer, where I spend 12 hours a day. I have more equipment than most people, and it can become cluttered, so I’ve recently purchased a few items to neaten as well as beautify, a shelf for the back of my iMac to hide equipment, a high-end mouse, Rocketbooks that are erasable and reusable to replace my paper notebooks, as well as added a computer graphics tablet. The latter is both personal and for work.


That said, since I am nearing retirement, I do think about how I will transition, and contributing via mentoring, education, and coaching might be part of that, but may be more important now, to get out of one’s little self-oriented bubble.",Nov '20
834,How do you sustain long-term motivation against Covid-19?,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Sally7,7,"Wow, @Terry4, this is a tough one. And I am coming at from a very different view point.
I am one of those who is going to work everyday. And yes, I a very thankfully I continue to have a weekly paycheck and health insurance. I also am not sitting at home staring at the walls. I go to work everyday and do my 8 hours.
It has been a very long 9 months. And I have seen first hand how people’s mind set has changed. At first, everyone was in panic mode. Everyone was very concerned and willing to do what the health professionals were saying. As crazy as it was early on, people were concerned.
Now, people are tired and they don’t care anymore. I am in a state that masks are mandatory when out in public and whenever I doors. But it is amazing how many people don’t wear them correctly or at all. No one understands what 6 feet looks like. I am running away from people all the time at work. So many just keep getting closer and closer, and as I back up and away, they keep coming closer. Can’t tell you how many times, I have to beg people to backup and I can help them find what they need. But wow, I feel like I have gotten this far with all the protocols my employer has put into effect and as we get closer to a vaccine, I might not make it due to people complaining how tired they are.
I am so tired. I miss going out to eat with family and friends.I miss having friends over. I miss going to the zoo, wild animal park, seaworld, museums in the park. I miss a lot. But I have made it 50 years with my diabetes and I don’t want a virus to take me out.
So, I spend my off days at home. Playing with the dogs, walking the dogs, reading books, watching tv, sewing masks for myself and family and friends, scrapbooking, gardening. There are things I usually do and I still do. It’s just a lot more quiet.
I am just hoping and praying that people understand that we have to keep at this. It will get much worse if we don’t stay at this. I had the hardest conversation with my daughter and her boyfriend who were were going to have over for Thanksgiving dinner outside on the patio. I had to tell her she couldn’t come over because they made the decision to go to Mexico this weekend. I can’t take that kind of risk. Thankfully she understands our thought process but I am amazed that they made that decision. My son, who lives with us still because he couldn’t transfer to a 4 year university due to everything being virtual. He lives with 2 older parents, both with pre existing conditions, and he works with seniors has not seen his friend in person since March. It has been painful.
Can we get through this? I think we can! I think those of us who deal with a chronic condition can handle anything thrown at them. We got this! I just keep plugging along! And pray everyday that people will get it to help save our healthcare workers. If we think we are tired, just think about what they are doing everyday without the support they need. We had a nursing shortage before this and now with so many getting sick and being physically and mentally exhausted!
Ok, enough of my ranting. Just please everyone be safe and smart! And please if you need to talk, know there are organizations out there you can call! Hang in there everyone!",Nov '20

And your case is especially inspiring since you deal with the added risk of living with T1D.
I agree that the mood of the general population has morphed from concern, panic, and preparation last spring to one of fatigue with all things Covid. I sense that that fatigue is generally more prevalent in the younger and less vulnerable groups, a sad reality that I don’t know how to deal with.
I acknowledge, however, that many members of my age cohort have decided that they just don’t care about public health measure surrounding Covid-19.
I think that the less vulnerable groups might think that people like me, older with significant comorbidities, are over-reacting to things. I guess that difference of opinion comes down to just how vulnerable each group feels about this threat.
Oregon Health and Science University emergency room doctor, Esther Choo, makes an impassioned plea for fellow Oregonians to step up and do the right thing.

Now is the time to double down on the only truly effective measures to stop this virus: wear a mask, keep your physical distance, wash your hands and for the next two weeks, please stay home!

We saluted our healthcare heroes last spring by banging pots and pans every evening. They are now pleading with us to honor that sentiment. They deserve our cooperation.

It prompts me to pair my bluetooth to the DexcomH3 receiver every 1-1.5 minutes. If I don’t answer the alert and press the “pair” prompt, my transmitter/sensor disconnects from Xdrip and I do not get readings. Not great for sleeping which is when I need those alerts. I turned on my old Dexcom receiver 3 days ago and it has no problems detecting the transmitter data…ever. It’s just that the sound isn’t loud enough for me to always hear an alert which is a reason why I stopped using it. I do not know how to fix the problem other than to remove Xdrip and re-install the app…if that will even help the problem Grrr. I don’t think it matters but I have an LG V60 ThinQ that was purchased in October.
Which brings me to my next issue. I have not figured out how to upload my data to Dexcom site. I entered my Dexcom username/password into Xdrip but nothing happens. IDK if I am doing something wrong or if it is somehow related to my bluetooth problem. But, if I uninstall the app, I lose all my data. I have an endo
MD appointment Thursday and can’t go there with less than a week of data for the past 3 months.
The other issue is I am supposed to go to endo educator TOMORROW for my 3 hour pump training. How am I supposed to do that if I can’t get my readings properly from my Dexcom equipment?
I am a tech idiot and can’t figure out how to fix it. No one in my house knows what the problem is. I even went to the bluetooth settings in my phone, unpaired everything and then paired devices again. My car bluetooth, no problem staying connected but Xdrip…still no.

I think it would be a big benefit to you, even if you only enabled it over night. You used it before, can you just restart it?
My take is that people get disappointed in various looping tech when they expect too much out of it. What looping is really, really good at is overnight management, during overnight fasting. That should work well out of the box.
It is much more complicated for looping to get meal management dialed in, because of delays in insulin and digestion, and sudden changes in eating, exercise, etc. while awake. So start off with the expectation that looping is mostly for overnight sanity, and add in meal management during waking hours only as experience allows.

Carb/insulin ratio varies more - counting the carb, different types of carb, different foods eaten with, different digestion speed, etc. So use your best guess, but bear in mind it shouldn’t affect you overnight. Also, eat and take your last food bolus at least a few hours before bed so it will have less impact overnight.
Basal rate is dialed into your pump already, and correction ratio is something I can rely on, unless I am still digesting and throwing more food into the blood. So measure correction ratio some time when you are high after your last food and insulin are finished. Hopefully you’ll find a value that is stable, like I did.",4d

Not exactly though. Some of these vaccines are creating responses to the covid virus’s spikes (mRNA) vs the whole virus (viral-vectored). So there could be variability in exactly what the immune system is being given as a prompt to attack, even if the end result is that it kills the same virus.

I am very active and my Dr was always very specific about what kind of exercises I could and couldn’t do due to the effect they could have on my eyes (absolutely no push ups, be extra careful with sit-ups and crunches, no heavy weights, ect.) so I really was expecting him to recommend me having a C-section due to any pushing. He shocked me today and said it is totally up to me whether I want to have the baby naturally or opt for C-section instead.

A serial killer is loose in my neighborhood. The authorities have warned all of us to stay in our houses and to not approach any strangers. The authorities know who he is, but they have not been able to capture him or to stop him. He killed an innocent man, a year younger than I, in my neighborhood two weeks ago. Last night, he killed an elderly man in this town. A month ago, he hit a woman so hard that she was in the hospital for over a month. Then he attacked her husband, so he ended up in the same hospital.
This serial killer is so hard to capture because he has no pattern. He kills men and women, young adults, teenagers, children, and even babies. And he uses horrific means to murder the innocent. Rather than swift deaths, he tortures them. He inflicts his victims with terrible pain, and then he sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly suffocates them or starts a reaction in them which causes eventual death.
A few nights ago, my neighbor lady had a huge gathering of family and friends. They carried on as if the killer was not roaming the neighborhood. For all they know, he was right there among them! But the killer has no recognizable face that the police can put up in a wanted poster. He pretends to be like everyone else… until he chooses his next victim. I do not socialize with others; I stay home. When I must go out, I hide my face in the hopes that he will not recognize me later. I am scared, so I stay home.

You can buy a monkey fist, but this is how you make one. The elderly guys on the street carry these all the time (make one that is larger than this). Sometimes they tie it to a large metal crucifix that fits into the pocket. That makes it easy to grab and swing at someone on the street.

I do that because I had a pod failure one time with a larger dose the first time after a pod change and had a pod failure. Tech support suggested starting with a small dose to make sure everything is working then take a correction dose. Often with a pod change the BG's will have been high for a while so if you make the first dose a correction dose, it is often a large one I'm working on ways to avoid those high BGs at the end of the 3 day pod life by trying other insulins than the Apidra I've been on since using the pod.

Excellent! Since last October I have restricted my carb consumption to < 30 grams/day. Since then I have slowly lost seven pounds. My target weight is now set to 150 pounds, a number a I picked since that’s what I weighed at the end of high school. Seeing your numbers makes me consider that I might do better at < 150 pounds.
I see weight loss as a way for me to lower my high blood pressure and hopefully get off of my meds. The one thought that gives me pause is that a sustained health crisis can often consume significant body weight and carrying a few extra pounds offers some insurance against that threat.
@SarahMichelle – Good luck with your keto-diet implementation. The carb cravings will stop after a week or two.  Drinking bone broth is a great tactic to minimize these cravings due to the extra sodium it provides. Many people don’t make it past this initial challenge and then don’t accrue the many benefits that a sustained effort will yield. It is so worth the effort; don’t give up!",Feb '19

Terry, it’s funny. When I started 6 months ago, 150lbs was also my target. Secretly, I never thought I’d get there. In the meantime, I’ve relearned everything I know about good nutrition, throwing out numerous “healthy foods” that have been pushed on all of us for years. When I reached 150, I plateaued for 2 months and even put weight back on, but only because I can’t eat much more than 45gms of protein a day (T1D renal issues).

I suggest you pick up a bottle of MCT oil to help you slide into ketosis far faster. MCT’s are medium chain triglycerides, which are near-instantly digested and sent to the liver where they produce low levels of ketones (yes, you want ketones in your bloodstream, they are your new fuel now that you’re not consuming carbs).
Once you’re more fully into ketosis, you can back way off on the MCT oil, as all your ketones will be produced from metabolized body fats.
IMPORTANT - There are suggestions all over the internet to “take a tablespoon or 2 of  MCT oil”. I’m warning you right now not to do this, as it turns out MCT oil is a far more powerful laxative than anything on the market. Less than a teaspoon (perhaps every morning or evening) is all I’d take. It also can cause severe stomach cramps when taken initially so don’t start too quickly.

 ArcherAidan:

type 1s aren’t able to process ketones properly. Thoughts on this article?


Here’s the paragraph that likely informed your comment.

People with type 1 diabetes should not try to achieve ketosis through the ketogenic diet or otherwise. Because people with type 1 diabetes don’t have insulin, they cannot metabolize ketones, which are gradually flushed through urine in people without the disease. For people with type 1 diabetes, ketosis can result in an accumulation of ketone acids in their bloodstream known as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), says Dr. Greenfield.

This is nonsense! People with type 1 diabetes  can process ketones as energy just like gluco-normals do. I say this because I have successfully utilized a low-carb, high-fat diet for the last 6+ years and spend much time in healthy ketosis.
This Dr. Greenfield embarrassingly suffers a common confusion about ketosis vs. diabetic ketoacidosis. The rest of the cited article makes this distinction between ketosis and DKA very well, more than once. Dr. Greenfield’s quote is not factually correct. Ketones can be metabolized by most tissues in the body and the brain can run quite happily on ketones. Not all ketones are flushed out by the kidneys.
People with T1D do take exogenous insulin. Perhaps the good doctor was talking about DKA that precedes initial diagnosis when T1Ds do not have any native or external insulin added.
As I’ve written before about the difference between ketosis and DKA is like the difference between a light breeze and hurricane force winds. Many medical professionals have historically confused these two different states, especially in the dietitian ranks. I must note that this is improving but Dr. Greenfield reminds me that this confusion is still muddying the waters for many patients.",Feb '19

946,Interesting read on the ketogenic diet,Food,Hammer,1,"I will say something on this.
I did the keto diet when I was first diagnosed.
I lost weight, and kept my BG numbers down (mis-diagnosed as type 2, so no insulin yet.)
I finally got on insulin, but kept at the Keto diet because it was working!
I did have one episode where I was going into DKA with normal BG numbers (I was between 110 to 120 at the time.)
I got myself out of it before I had to go to the emergency room (even though I probably should have went,) by eating carbs and large doses of insulin.
I didn’t have a full grasp on being type 1 yet, and how my body worked. But I was blindly going by my BG numbers to guess how I was doing.
After that I got ketone strips to test with!
I highly recommend testing your ketones to make sure you are in a safe and healthy zone when going on a keto diet. At least until you have a good feel for how your body reacts to this kind of diet.",Feb '19

Greenfield was my doctor for roughly a year.  He was excellent at calculating insulin infused thru IV to keep me steady during my stay in the hospital for surgery.  I’ve never had such accurate delivery of insulin to balance out the carbs I’d get thru various IV’s.   I switched docs when I no longer worked near him, but I have nothing but good to say about him other than he was ALWAYS very late for appointments.  Sometimes more than 2.5 hours late.   Say what you will, he is one of the best endos in the South Bay.

Is it the point that people ""with type 1 diabetes should not try to achieve ketosis through the ketogenic diet or otherwise?


Do you disagree with my assertion that “people with T1D do have insulin” since they must take it to survive?


Do you think that all instances of ketosis lead to DKA?


Your personal experience with Dr. Greenfield paints a much different picture than the article did. If the doctor’s position was mis-portrayed by the article writer, then that left me with a skewed sense of his competence.
I have read many accounts from professional medicos who don’t understand that ketosis is a daily fact of life for almost all people. It’s how our body compensates for lack of food when we sleep for eight hours and don’t eat. The demonizaton of ketosis is often asserted by professionals who support the low-fat and highly processed carb diets, the standard American diet or SAD.",Feb '19

type 1s aren’t able to process ketones properly.


The article, especially the statement “Type 1s aren’t able to process ketones properly” is absolutely false, and there are 100’s if not 1,000’s of keto practicing T1D MD’s that dispel this old fashioned myth. Perhaps as Terry suggested the good doctor was misquoted?
More to the point, T1D’s are more readily able to control their ketone level with proper blood glucose than T2’s, as T1’s can monitor their BG and inject (pump) the lowest possible insulin levels required to maintain target blood sugars. Insulin is effective at doing 3 things: metabolizing glucose, storing excess energy as fat, and lastly putting the brakes on rising ketones.
If insulin is high, ketone production (ketogenesis) is blocked. If insulin is low, ketone production is increased.

I do stay hydrated most days. I am an avid tea drinker by day and water drinker by night. Tea or water goes everywhere with me.
I use Skin Tac on the adhesive when I first apply it and then I touch it up all the time with a Q tip under the edges as needed. That is usually after  I wash my hair (longer shower and I think the shampoo and conditioner loosen it easier) and after I snorkel. But sometimes it needs touching up.

I’ve always suspected this is the largest factor that matters.  I’m not quite that good yet, I usually run 98% 70-160, and I definitely go over 140 sometimes.  I used to reliabily get 30 days from a sensor, but seems like lately it’s 24-26.

I’m also a huge water drinker.  Most people are dehydrated and don’t even know it.  In my previous profession we always had to advise our test patients to drink their water… And it was like pulling teeth!  “But I don’t like water”, in a whine that would make a toddler proud.  I don’t know if it’s changed, but the popular hydration protocol at the time was half your body weight (in pounds) in fluid ounces of water, every day. The average American adult male weighs nearly 200 lbs, so that would be 100 ounces of water daily.  85 fluid ounces for the average 170 lb American woman.  (I had to look those weights up, had no idea the averages were that high.  Google source may be wonky, but the math remains the same)  It may have become stylish to carry a water bottle around, but I don’t believe many people are actually drinking that much.  I became fanatical when I finally started to understand that you can’t move waste products and toxins out of your body when there’s no interstitial fluid and no excess fluid to flush the lymphatic system.  I knew hydration was important for steady readings, but perhaps it does play a really critical role in sensor life, too.
I definitely think there’s a body chemistry element, too, though.  Which unfortunately is outside our control.  I’ve got a few control idols on this site, who I know haven’t gotten the same sensor life I have, despite having better diabetes management.",Dec '20

Interesting theory about the greens, too.  We rarely eat lunch in this house.  We’re more big breakfast and dinner, and no time for lunch.  We will often drink an Amazing Grass drink midday, though.  I like the plain flavor with a little added citrus, because I can’t stomach sweet tasting drinks at all, but it comes in tons of flavors, too. Never really considered that it might have a beneficial affect on body chemistry.  I just think of it as “instant salad”… and it’s way easier to carry out into the farm than a proper lunch.

Going by simple math, you should be drinking about 85 ounces of water a day, or 2.5 liters   Personally, I think if you need to nickle and dime every ounce of fluid in your food to meet that criteria, then you haven’t created a satisfactory water drinking habit, yet
We don’t usually have to talk about salt in drinks, but while salt is an important nutrient, it would also fall into the CRAP category I mentioned earlier, because it’s dehydrating just like caffeine, refined sugars, alcohol, and processed chemical ingredients that need flushed from your body with… Water.   So no, you can’t just count a bowl of campbell’s soup as water.  If we’re talking condensed soup, where you know exactly how much water you add to it, I suppose you could count some, but not all of the water added.  You have to account for the negative affect of the salt in the soup.  However, not all soup is created equal.  If we’re talking homemade soup made from homemade stock that has nothing other than water, bones, and the juices extracted from the vegetables in it… Then heck yeah, I’d let that pass for your water content.

We are a permaculture farm, as are our friends we trade with.  So that probably sets us apart from the norm food-wise.  Think along the lines of organic, but without all the governmental BS and fewer loopholes to add crap to the food.  We don’t grow or feed with any commercial or chemical products.  The cows are grass finished.  The grass was intentionally seeded with a mix of greens for optimum nutrition.  The grass is only ever fertilized with a homebrewed mix called “compost tea”, which is primarily worm poop, molasses, and compost fermented with healthy bacteria.  They spend their whole life in green fields.  They never get injections (the rare emergency antibiotic if one gets sick excluded), see a feed lot, nor a bucket of corn. The chickens are primarily free range and scavenge most their food from the field plants, and insects in the compost pile.  We do save the sunflower seeds from our summer sunflower wind-break to supplement their winter diet.
The fruit and vegetables we grow are similarly grown in a symbiotic food forests that fuels itself without external inputs… Not these perfect rows of single crops that rape the land of all it’s got, so it has to be pumped full of lab created supplements.

 earthling:

I get you have to use the pump for control IQ, but why in the world is it so darned short ranged??


Because that’s exactly what Bluetooth is.  Bluetooth uses a very weak radio signal that can only travel about 30 feet and is easily blocked, which is precisely why it’s available for open use and not a limited use/licensed frequency.  It’s available to use freely for these short-distance communications precisely because there is little practical use for it otherwise and it’s too weak to wreak much damage if someone tries to employ it inappropriately.
The problem isn’t with the pump being more weak or defective.  It works exactly like your cell phone and receiver do to communicate with the transmitter (sorry @MM1, but all the talking is done via Bluetooth, even to pump and receiver).  The problem is with the close proximity and all the possible interference the signal can face trying to get from one place mounted on your body to another place mounted on your body.  There’s a lot of chance for something to disrupt the signal. This is one of those problems that largely goes away once the pump trains you how to place things happily.  Moving the pump away from our lumps, bumps, curves, and miscellaneous interfering appendages will actually improve connection.  The pump trained me to put it on the bed next to me at night, rather than attaching it to me, or else I get dropped communication alarms.  I don’t know why, but I’ve never seen much of a problem with this during the day.
The one thing Tandem could do better is rearrange some internal components so the Bluetooth antenna isn’t behind the screen.  But I think that’s one of those, no win situation things.  My perfect wear placement requires the screen to be facing me, otherwise I would look like Ironman all the time with a brightly lit chest bulge.  But that’s just how I like it, I’m sure it’s a 50/50 split on directional preference.
@MM1 had a great point about not being able to use both the pump and receiver, though   The G6 can connect to one primary medical device (pump OR receiver) and one secondary device (smartphone or standalone watch mostly).  If you’re trying to use BOTH the receiver and the pump, they’re going to fight one another and the information will only go to the strongest connection.",Dec '20

I tried using my t-slim pump to connect with my G6 receiver for awhile. I didn’t like it though, due to how close it has to be to where my sensor/transmitter is on my body to stay connected and show me readings. So I turned off the Dexcom function on my pump and went back to the receiver that came with my G6 kit. I’m a lot happier that way, though you’re right, I can’t use Dexcom Control IQ this way. I read enough about people disliking aspects of that system to decide I wanted to stick with what I’ve been doing that’s working ok for me.
I’m guessing it’s just me with such preferences. I think if I were either younger, or older and in hospital/nursing home care, Control IQ would rock and I’d turn it on.

If the t:slim x2 & the Dexcom receiver don’t use bluetooth to connect, then what do they use? You appear to be saying that the Dexcom G6 transmits using two different protocols.
That seems unlikely to me if for no other reason than it increases the product cost. Why on earth would Dexcom do that? What benefits would it provide to justify the extra cost & complexity?

I PROMISE, all the communications are done via Bluetooth (BLE).
Page 326 of the Dexcom G6 user manual specifically states that it will not accept communications any other way:

The G6 System is designed to transmit data between the transmitter and designated
display devices in accordance to the industry standard BLE protocols. It will not accept
radio frequency (RF) communications using any other protocol, including Bluetooth
classic communication protocols.

Bluetooth Low Energy technology is a  type of wireless communication used in  cell phones and many other devices.  Your t:slim X2 pump and a CGM  transmitter wirelessly pair together with  other devices using Bluetooth wireless  technology communication. This allows  the pump and transmitter paired  devices to communicate securely and  only with each other.

Either the Tandem rep was confused, inadequately conveyed something, or you misunderstood something.
I assume what was meant is that the X2 accrually has TWO Bluetooth radios/antennae.  When they rolled our Control-IQ (and also updated Basal-IQ at the same time), they added the Bluetooth toggle button to the interface.  There was a lot of communication at the time, and again later when they rolled out the T:connect app, because there was confusion about the purpose of the button.

Hi Trying:
No I do not use arms for sensor as I sleep on my sides and am afraid that an arm position would result in frequent compression lows when transmitter gets buried in mattress.
For me the best positions are in a straight line between the belly button and xiphoid process.  That way I can sleep on either right side or left side and transmitter still gets line of sight to receiver.  There is enough real estate in that area to move the sensor up or down up to a couple of inches so that insertion areas get a a few weeks of rest before they are reused.",Jun '19

My son’s phone easily picks up the signal right through the mattress, floor and double-brick wall when he goes to bed and accidentally leaved his phone on the charger in the kitchen.
To the OP: FWIW my son mostly wears the sensors on his arm, but sometimes belly or upper buttocks. The arm seems to suffer from less lag between CGM and measured BGL than the upper buttock (along with higher and lower spikes. Both are similar in terms of compression lows (which are due to physical compression of the area the sensor is in, and nothing to do with obstruction of the bluetooth signal) but this would vary depending on your sleeping position (he rolls around a lot). The belly is our least preferred spot, it peels off the quickest and fails soonest because the skin moves the most. A tug on the sensor (which could be from leaning against a desk, contact sports or just skin folds moving when bending over or wriggling around) causes the filament to move under your skin, leading to a ‘sensor failure’ - sometimes these can come good if you wait a while and restart them, but if the filament has pulled out too much it is toast.",Jun '19

 Dylan_Sutton:

We are all different and what works for one person does not necessarily work for another.  I have a low BMI 18.5 and have read a lot of posts of individuals with low BMI having issues with Dexcom CGM readings.  For me, line of sight is very important.  I don’t even need much compression to cause a compression low, by wearing the sensor just above the belly button, all I need to do is turn onto my stomach on mattress and even with holding myself up with my arms so transmitter fully touches the mattress without compression, my BG drops about 50 points with receiver just 2 feet away on night table.  If I snuggle a partner and just have transmitter touch skin of partner I get total signal loss.
There is an ongoing argument if it is a bluetooth signal issue or filament in fluid issue.  In reality it is probably a combination of both depending on individual and situation and equipment.  I am on Dexcom G5 and receiver.  Even with Dexcom there are several variables such as if you are using a receiver or a phone, which app you are using if with a phone, which transmitter G4,G5, or G6 and if you are on blue tooth which BT version you have and which Dexcom version of software you are running.  My mattress is memory foam and maybe that is even a contributor.
You are lucky that your son’s signal will go through mattress, floor, brick walls and leap tall buildings in a single bound.  I am not so lucky so obviously what works or does not work for me does not affect your situation.  You claim your son still  gets compression lows from time to time.  I keep line of sight for past 8 months and have not had 1 compression low.
Belly is best position for me and by using opsite, have never had a sensor pull out due to folding skin, sports, furniture, seat belts etc.  and by keeping line of sight between transmitter and receiver never lose or distort signal when within 20 unobstructed feet between transmitter and receiver.",Jun '19
1043,Dexcom G6 Sensor/Transmitter in Arm?,Diabetes Technology,Dylan_Sutton,1,"From everything I’ve read about Dexcom, all the processing happens on the transmitter, and the app or receiver just displays the values calculated on the transmitter. The app or receiver (or pump) also let you enter a calibration value, and send sensor start/stop commands to the transmitter so it knows which inbuilt calibration curve to use (based on time since sensor start), but the processing still happens solely on the transmitter. Interrupting the Bluetooth signal shouldn’t be able to affect the values displayed, it’s a digital protocol with checksum so it (whether phone app or receiver) should either show the value sent by the transmitter or nothing at all.",Jun '19

 Dylan_Sutton:

“should” is I think the caveat here.  We all know that BT is suseptible to signal distortion.  There is also a possibility of positioning of sensor filament in the interstitial fluid that could affect what the transmitter sends.  There are two different scenarios.  1 is signal/no signal and I can make that easily happen even with transmitter within 2 ft of receiver.  2 is what I believe to be signal distortion from compression low.  Once I start to roll onto my stomach inserted sensor, my BG drops 20 - 60 points, usually more in the 40-50 range.  Again, I can easily make this happen by lightly rolling onto sensor and then comes right back to normal within 5 minutes when I roll back off sensor.  Since I can deeply bury transmitter into mattress, or very lightly bury into mattress with same modified BG results, my assumption leans more toward BT signal distortion than change in filament position in fluid.  I had fun a while back showing a roller coaster curve on my receiver by rolling on and off transmitter several times to show that it can be totally artificially induced.",Jun '19

It seems you have pretty limited options. I respect your bold, honest exploration. Your criticism is super valid. Strange that no one else has bumped into this before.

1069,Returning Tslim insulin pump,Diabetes Technology,mohe0001,1,"The way to think about your dosing would have this:
Most of the time, when we talk about basal rates, we are talking about an amount of insulin that is delivered over the course of an hour.  But, when we talk about your dose, its only being delivered over 15 min, so its 1/4 of the amount of insulin (15 min is 1/4 of an hour).
Typically, A basal rate of 1 means that we deliver 1 unit over 1 hour. A basal rate of 2 means that we deliver 2 units over an hour.
You were delivering insulin over a much shorter time period - a quarter of an hour (1/4 of an hour).
So, instead of delivering 0.1 units per hour, you delivered 0.1 x (25%) = 0.1 x 0.25 = 0.025 units per quarter of an hour (15 minutes). So, you have to divide the dose by 4 to make it the same as how we usually talk about it.
There are 4 quarters in a dollar. You were only delivering a quarters worth of insulin.
So, 0.1/4 = 0.025
0.025 is 1/4 of 0.1
image780×663 48.1 KB
If, instead, you delivered that same dose (0.1 units) over 30 min, or 1/2 an hour, then
you would need to divide 0.1 units by 2.
0.1/2 = 0.05 units
Twice as much time = twice as much insulin.

1070,Returning Tslim insulin pump,Diabetes Technology,Dee_Meloche,,"I read that too. Medtronic is going to partner with tidepool. They are going to add bluetooth so that users can select the system that works for them. Medtronic realizes that people were having insurance problems because Medicare didn’t cover Medtronic’s sensors. It put those people at a disavantage. They also realize that their 670 system wasn’t cracked up to what it is supposed to be. It needed 3 or 4 fingerstick calibrations for the sensor to be accurate. It locked people out of automode, The new pump will also have an adjustable  target and automatic corrections if carbohydrates weren’t calculated properly. Sounds very promising indeed. I think medtronic realizes that they can’t compete with dexcom because that is all dexcom does is cgms. In my government program they say I won’t become eligible  for a new pump until 2022. They are going from when my vibe  got replaced by my 630. It should have been in 2021. Oh well, by that time maybe the 780 will be available.",Jul '20
1071,Returning Tslim insulin pump,Diabetes Technology,Dee_Meloche,2,I really appreciate your heartfelt reply but to tell you the truth I felt so much safer on my medtronic when I connected to it on Sunday after supper. Tandem was saying that “we have the insulin pump with the smallest basal rate.” Turns out the only way to achieve that is with a series of starts and stops at certain intervals. It may be “pretty slim” but I have to do what works for me and medtronic’s pumps do that.,Jul '20

Her normal dose using Medtronic pump is delivered over hour.
The issue is that tslim pump requires a minimum .100 data entry per segment basal rate.
It allows .101, allowing .001 precision above .100.
To mimic what Medtronic pump can do, she was using 0 segments + .100 segment.  Her total basal is unusually low.
She gave it a good try, but its fault of pump to not allow segment less than .100, when the micro-delivery can deliver .001 per pulse.",Jul '20

1076,Returning Tslim insulin pump,Diabetes Technology,T1D40yr,5,"I think people are splitting hairs here. Who has a basal rate less than 0.1 per hour? For a person whose basal is only a mere 20% of their daily dose, that’s a total daily dose of only 7 units per day. That’s incredibly unusual. And, as was pointed out, you could alternate with a basal of 0 for short periods of time to achieve a lower effective rate. Furthermore, I seriously doubt a Medtronic pump could accurately or reliably deliver a dose so small.
As far as converting fractions to decimals is concerned, get a calculator. Enter a 1. Divide by 4. There, you have your entree for 1/4th.
The bottom line is which pump results in better control. And frankly, you need a pump that integrates with an accurate and reliable sensor for that. Medtronic doesn’t; Tandem does.",Jul '20
1077,Returning Tslim insulin pump,Diabetes Technology,Dee_Meloche,,"I am now thinking about getting the 770. The cgm will get more accurate and easier to insert and no calibrations needed except on the first day. I do that with my dexcom, no big deal.

1102,2021 Insulin $35 monthly copay with medicare,Type 1 and LADA,Aeonn,1,"Hello community of experts. . .
I dropped the ball on this topic and not up to date.
I am T1 with 11 yr old out of warranty T-slim pump not in use doing MDI at the moment and playing catchup. Poor control I am embarrassed to admit.
Pharmacist said can’t verify the new $35/month and until putting new script through. Several said never heard of it and do insulin script every day. I am going there shortly to drop off a new script and we’ll see in a couple of days when it’s ready.
By tonight I am completely out of insulin and have to figure out something immediately.
My copay had been running over a grand per month. Called my insurance company today and held for 3 hours to ask, then call got disconnected.  Called back and held for over another hour before I hung up.
In other news. . . two years ago I D/C’d insulin pump use after giving up on finding anybody near me or by mail to fill insulin scripts under part B for use in a pump. Initially I had a place doing it then they stopped. To my knowledge nobody is doing it in my State (Florida) despite people here saying they get it that way. That’s a side bar issue.
I can always use the OTC cheap R from WulMurt for a day or two. My insurance is an advantage plan. My concern is that maybe I have to “opt in” or some other gotchya snag which I likely scr*wed up to get the $35 copay.
I just hope this works out smoothly for those of us who end up in the donut hole the first week of each new year.
Insulin for $35/mon copay seems like the impossible dream.

Understanding Medicare's New $35 Insulin Price Cap 9
New policy slashes insulin prices for people with diabetes on Medicare, but what are the nuances of this change? Here's what you should know.





Seems to apply to Medicare Part D.
If using pump, usually cheaper as Part B, but I think you can choose Part D and get $35 price.
Likely to be confusion by pharmacies, and whether their billing systems are updated.",6d

stay on the part d plan I have now. With the new $35 scam it would cost around $1000 and without around $700. What a useless pile of crap.",5d
1107,2021 Insulin $35 monthly copay with medicare,Type 1 and LADA,MM1,,"Not sure I understand your situation.  If you have a Part D plan, it would be $35.  If there is deductible, doesn’t matter.
REVIEW THIS:
Importantly, this new Medicare $35 cap impacts all of these coverage stages, meaning patients will not be required to pay the large deductible first, or the often higher costs experienced during the “donut hole” stage.
This chart from CMS breaks it down nicely, showing even if you have Part D deductable, it doesn’t need to met for the $35 price.  Note the right hand side.
Certainly you may have a case where Part B is better than $35.

Complete scam to me. I just looked at it and would require a more expensive part d plan.


How much do you pay for your Part D?  I just paid my Part D premium today for the full year and the total premium was $194.40 so the $35 monthly insulin cap would be a substantial saving.  I will, however,  keep buying my insulin out-of-pocket as the formulary on my Part D is Novolog and I have always preferred using Humalog so can afford and am willing to pay the difference to stay with Humalog.  Maybe you should just find a lower-priced Medicare Part D insurance during the next open enrollment period.
Now is not the time to look at your Medicare Part D insurance plan.  Not doing your research during the open enrolment period, does not a scam make!!!  That is on you.",5d

 CJ114:

formulary on my Part D is Novolog and I have always preferred using Humalog


I’m the opposite.  I prefer novolog, and last year my insurance switched to humalog.
However, I found a “cash pay” alternative to get $99 novolog for up to 3 vials.  But that likely ended year end, hoping to see if new offer is available.",4d
1110,2021 Insulin $35 monthly copay with medicare,Type 1 and LADA,Aeonn,,"I have a part C plan which means an advantage plan. That also means I have part A,B and D. My insurer is United Healthcare and I am in Florida. And specifically for the $35 per month insulins, I am in, and one must be in or get excluded, what they call a senior savings model which means that no deductibles apply for getting the so-called $35 benefit any time of the year, donut hole or not. But when the pharmacy put through my script apparently, they told me, since I have been a pump user historically, any new script they see for my insulin in 10mL vials they process as of now under part B not part D meaning my 20% copay is many hundreds more than merely $35 a month. I cannot verify this but it is what I was told today. This is hard for me to believe but apparently if I am scripted for Kwickpens then the insurer automatically puts the copay under my part D and there’s no confusion with part B.
In the past we all wanted insulin under part B because it was less copay than under D but not with the $35 a month plan it is just the reverse. I can use any insulins by any route. I couldn’t care less about staying with a pump. I just need the insulin. I know how to best use all of them and various combinations. Anything is better than the OTC R or N by Relion brand sold cheaply at WulMurt. That’s a familiar fall-back plan out of desperation for pumpers who run out of Novolog or Humalog in 10mL vials regardless of the concentrations. For that matter, i can get Kwickpen insulin into a pump if necessary and adjust for the concentration if the Kwickpens are U-200 by using half the dose volume to equate to the U-100 even though we are told not to do this.
Long story short, Kwickpens may (or most likely if not definitely) come under the $35 plan now but vial may not for prior pumpers.
More confusing, apparently insulin lispro (humalog) is covered as U-100 but not U-200, they told me (although I cannot verify) under a part D $35 copay but for Lyumjev the $35 monthly cost applies to any amount of either U-100 or U-200 per month. Makes no sense to me why that is so but let’s presume it is since I was told so by Optim-Rx which is the mail order arm used by United (and maybe others).
As an additional aside, Lyumjev comes in U-100 and U-200. But I am not familiar with it. I never used it. I presume it is new or newer.
The bottom line remains paying as little as possible for insulin(s) by high-dose T1 people like me.",2h

1127,T:Slim X2 users - is there a way to add more insulin to cartridge?,Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,2,"Yep.  Go through the normal change cartridge procedure, adding your insulin when it tells you to insert a new cartridge.  Hit the unlock button and wait for it to register the cartridge.  Then, pop the cartridge back out BEFORE hitting the fill tubing button.  Don’t remove it completely, just move it free of the piston.  You want to be ready to lock it back in place.  After the pump thinks it has filled ten units, you can seat the cartridge back into it’s proper place.  This is the only tricky part.  You’ll get an error message if you put pressure on the piston.  You have to time it right so that you snap the cartridge into position while the piston is retracted.  You’ll be able to tell the right time by listening to the noises the piston makes.
In my experience, it never registers the full amount of insulin after doing this, but it will keep updating the amount and eventually does register it all.
Unfortunately, there’s no easy way to just skip the fill tubing process altogether.  At least not yet.  I think it might be coming in the next software update because a lot of people don’t change cartridges and infusion sets at the same time.",23d

There’s nothing wrong with stating the perspective that you and your family take with regard to your sense of vulnerability.

Making a sincere commitment to getting together once this health crisis has passed could help your friend to look past your obvious difference in worldview and focus on what you’ve shared in the past. If your polite and kind response is rebuffed or taken badly, that is beyond your power to control.

Around Halloween, I was talking with coworkers and neighbors about how we love Halloween and love answering the door to the hundreds of kids that come through. But this year, lights were off and decorations downplayed because the three people in our house are compromised or work with people who are. Everyone was very supportive and understanding with our thought process.
Now Thanksgiving has reared its ugly head. My daughter and her boyfriend who is our one household we spend time with, has made the decision to go to Mexico last weekend. I of course was very upset because I had to tell her we couldn’t have them over for dinner. I thought maybe they would cancel their trip but no, they went. So unfortunately we will not be having dinner together and won’t be celebrating together. She understands where we are coming from but wow, really? I am hoping they can pull it together for Christmas because we have never not been together for Christmas. Thanksgiving was always the holiday she didn’t come home for due to costs of trying to come home for both holidays while in school and after getting a job in SF and NYC. Last year was the first time she had Thanksgiving dinner with us because they have moved back to San Diego! But here we are so closed but so far away.
If your friends don’t understand how important your health and well being is, you may need to say goodbye to a friendship. But all of my friends and family have been very understanding to our views. Please be safe and do what you feel is safe. I had planned on dinner being outside this year but now that it is just our household, we are back inside. Maybe if they want to come by, set the guidelines out clearly and firmly and if they can meet them, great and if not oh well, maybe next year. So sorry it has come to this.

Our daughter and her family have taken social distancing as seriously as my husband and I, and so I still feel comfortable visiting with them. The only other person who is being vigilant is my mother in law, who just turned 90. The night before her birthday, we decided to make a “suprise” visit to her. We stayed in a hotel, which I cleaned with Lysol several times before feeling “ok”. My husband went and had a surprise socially distanced and mask-wearing visit with his mom. He didn’t even hug her. The next day was our granddaughter’s 7th birthday & since they have been on “lock down” since March, ordering groceries, home-schooling, son in law working from home, we made a surprise visit to her and then headed home. The issue is that we have another daughter, two of our sons, three more grandchildren, and my mother in that same area - none of whom have taken Covid very seriously. Our other children were ok, and understanding - even without me divulging my diabetes. My mother was very upset. We have explained that we are overweight, over 60, and both have high BP and so we are being extremely cautious. We also live in an area (Michigan) which has been very heavily affected.
She and I have struggled with this from the beginning. She is still working as a school bus aide for handicapped preschool children. A very noble job that she loves, and so she refuses to stop working, in spite of the risk. She insists that she cleans the bus, wears her mask, sanitizes her hands - but also acknowledges that the children don’t always keep their masks on, and, that there have been several cases among the bus drivers and the other aides. She still does her own shopping, even though I had been ordering food for her (until I found out she was still going out.) She visits friends and attends a church that does not believe that you need to wear a mask - rather, you should have “faith”.
I acknowledged that I had hurt her by not visiting, and then explained again that we have different mindsets on our approach to staying safe. I apologized for hurting her, and told her that we would just have to agree to disagree. Just as I cannot stop her from working, shopping, going to church and visiting friends, she has to accept my decision NOT to do the same. I didn’t tell her she was wrong (even though I believe she is), I just said we had different mindsets. I wish I could say that it made things better.

1148,Prediabetes - test all the antibodies?,Type 1 and LADA,flippingbean,,"Hi,
TLDR: what are the tests that one is recommended to absolutely get done to rule out T1/LADA?
long version:
My blood sugar has been coming back high in lab results, suggesting prediabetes.
I’m interested in knowing if I might be at risk for T1/LADA. I don’t have insurance or a primary care, so I’m trying to research on my own.
My google tells me it’s best to test for GADA,ICA/IA-2,IAA and ZnT8, plus fasting insulin, and insulin response to glucose?
Is it necessary to get all of those? I’m trying to weigh out my options narrowed down to the following 2:
Ultalabs $300 panel:
insulin response to glucose x4 (I imagine that’s 3 hours starting with fasting?)
GADA
IA-2
and a bunch of other things I’m not concerned with right now but maybe I should be?
Request-a-test offers a $400 panel of just the 4 antibodies: GADA, ICA,IAA,ZnT8
Does one of the panels above offer enough insight to rule out T1/LADA, in conjunction with the information I already have, or if I need to buy one panel and add other tests a-la-carte.
Background:
A year ago my A1c was 5.7, BG 177 on a non-fasting blood test (which my GP who ordered it said was normal but I suspect otherwise) .
Last week I did a GTT and it came back as follows:
fasting: 85
1hour: 199
2 hour: 199
3 hour: 103
I’m 35 yo, very active, BMI <20, 5’6/120lb don’t like sweet foods, naturally eat about 100g carbs/day max. I had to really force myself to eat 150 for 3 days before my GTT and it made my stomach wonky for days afterwards.
Until this past June I was eating 3000-4000cal/day spread over about 5 meals+snacks for the past 8 years (so I bet before June I was maybe eating 300g carbs/day). Then June-Aug I raised a puppy and neglected all my eating and sleeping patterns, eating once a day and subsisting mostly on adrenaline. Since August my stomach shrank, I eat less than half what I used to (but don’t think have lost more than 5lbs, didn’t know my weight before and haven’t noticed any change in weight). No matter how much sleep I get I can’t get enough energy so I figured it was time to investigate my BG numbers from last year, which was what prompted me to do the GTT.
I got a finger pricker yesterday and have been getting readings of:
morning high 98
daytime hungry: mid 80’s
1hr post full meal 130-140
2hr post full meal 130-155
post light meal (still hungry after eating) 120’s

Try cutting your carbs to under 50 per day for 3-4 weeks and make up the calorie count with good fats such as Avocados, Almonds etc.  Look into Keto for a couple of months and that should resolve your BG issues.  Then you can readjust your diet from there by staying on a Keto diet or modifying to something you prefer.  I am similar frame to yours at 5’9"" 125 lbs, eat 1 meal a day at lunch and have tons of energy on my fat adapted body diet and about 25 carbs/day.  I eat in the 800 calories per day range.  Avocados and nuts are your friend until you have the basics figured out, not a ton of testing.  Just get a periodic A1C test from UltaLabs, maybe every 3 months to start.

Nothing ever really gets ruled out in medicine.  Just because you are not T1 today, does not mean you will not be T1 or have cancer or something else a few years from now.  You may want to do a base Cholesterol test and if your LDL-C is increasing, then you could do an UltaLabs subfractionation test and alter your blood with diet and supplements to protect potential future heart issues as well as your pre-diabetes.

There’s generally no reason to rule it out unless you don’t respond to type 2 medications, and need insulin.  If you need insulin, there’s usually much better insurance coverage for delivery options if you’re type 1.

Insulin pump

 An insulin pump is a medical device used for the administration of insulin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy.
The device configuration may vary depending on design.  A traditional pump includes:
 Other configurations are possible. More recent models may include disposable or semi-disposable designs for the pumping mechanism and may eliminate tubing from the infusion set.

I adjust the dose up or down versus a target blood glucose level: 120 mg/dL as read from my CGM.  If higher I increase the dose, and if lower, I decrease the dose.

Yours is 7 and that’s nearly half of the 15 they teach you to count carbs in. Also called exchanges way back when.
So you can just double that and get very close.

It’s actually extremely accurate.  Tandem has shared the accuracy data with everyone, but unfortunately I was never able to find accuracy data for Medtronic pumps to compare it to. Check out page 308 in your owners manual.
Over the years, I’ve seen many people share that they had to adjust their pump settings since moving to Tandem, that they simply couldn’t transfer them exactly. You learned how to optimize your settings to work in your Medtronic pump(s), but it doesn’t mean that those values that worked for you were “true”, just that they were adjusts you made to optimize how the pump(s) worked for you.

You have already gotten some good suggestions from @Jim26 and @rcarli for checking that the pump is pumping and that the tubing is properly filled. In my experience, each “pulse” of the tubing fill registers about 0.3-0.4 units and moved the liquid about 1” each time along the length of the tubing. If you are using 23” tubing, I find that it takes 12-13 units to fill the t:lock connector and the tubing.
Is this your first infusion set with the t:slim or have you used several?
Every once in a while (like 1-2 times out of 100), my infusion set (I use autosoft 90), will not leave the Teflon tubing in my skin and it will be folded across my belly (rather than in it) underneath the adhesive. As a result, insulin is getting happily pumped with no alarms, but none of it is going into me so BS skyrockets. In that case, you can apply a new infusion set and then do a “Load” where you only select “Fill canula” with the existing cartridge and already filled tubing. That of course assumes that your cartridge and tubing are properly filled … which may or may not be true for you right now … but it will only use 0.3 U. That may be another thing to check.

Try not to get frustrated or discouraged.  
Once you have this in line, the rest will follow … but, always be prepared for those variances!  They happen.  I call them gremlins.  There are so many variables to consider.  That is one place you might be able to work with.  When you are basal testing, keep your days, afternoons, or evenings level - don’t do extra work, walking, gardening, stress, get the same sleep, … and so on.  Then, after you get one time-segment down, take a break for a few days and then go to the next time-segment, and so on.  You can do this!
If your bg creeps up or down by more than 30 points, then the test needs to be repeated, until you no longer have a variance of more than 30.  Now, if it is 35 or even 40, I might not worry too much, but they set the number at 30 for a reason.

 tedos:

For some people, yes.  Be patient with yourself and with the test.  Remember you don’t want any added stress to mess with the testing, so if you need a breather/break, take a few days off between each segment.  Three days, without going over or under 30 points from your starting point, that’s all you need for each segment, then put that segment aside and go to the next.  It will take time to fine tune them all individually and then once you’ve done that, look at the entire picture.



 tedos:

i can’t even get consistency with that.


I think it would help to see your bg numbers and times at this point.
Consistency isn’t what you’re going for.
You need to be three days with no more than 30 points difference, up or down.
So, if you start the basal testing for your first-segment and your bg is 130 when you begin, you shouldn’t go over 160 or below 100 each day of the three days you’re doing that segment.  Edited to add: Each day you test before you begin, so the next day you may begin at 160, so you don’t want to go over 190 or below 130.  The next day if you begin at 110 you don’t want to go over 140 or below 80.
Then, if you need it, give yourself a break for a few days before you move to segment-two, following the same 30 points up or down.
Integrated Diabetes calls the segments I’m referring to as phases.  There are four - morning, afternoon, evening, overnight.  They suggest beginning with the overnight.
This all takes time.  Three days for each segment/phase, followed by a few days break (if you need it), times four segments/phases is at least 12 days.  If you go high or low during any of the segments/phases and have to start over, or if you take a few breaks between segments/phases, that will add more time to the basal testing.",29d

Thanks @Tapestry .
Yes thats what I mean re consistency.  It’s not the same BG every night but the BG doesn’t float up or down over 30 points - I get all three variations hence not consistent .   It’s like I can get no floating +/- 30 points for 3 days and the next week, i start getting them so my basal which I thought was right, is wrong the next week.  When do I lock it down if it keeps changing?
I show you what i mean, here are 4 consecutive days of data (with the same basal setup) between 12am to 9am (my overnight basal).  I’m rocking it on tuesday with a flat line.  But monday it says I’m not enough around the 2am mark, wednesday says the same but more subtly.  Thursday tells a different story and my basal is not enough even before midnight.   Which day do I use to make my basal adjustment, they tell different stories? 
Note that when then start floating away, I do bolus to curb it in (I know I shouldn’t bolus during a basal test but as the BG drifts away, in my mind the basal test is over already).

I understand.  It doesn’t happen overnight or in a period of four days or ten.
When you go low, below 70, you need to end the test, lower your basal (the link explains this) and then restart the test.  The same is true when you go high.
Be patient with yourself and with your body’s way of telling you it needs more or less insulin - and do that, slowly.  It took me over six months before I had my basal where I wanted it.

It’s risen from 4.1 mmol (74mg) to 7.8 mmol (140 mg) this morning and arrow is still trending diagonally upwards.  Once I bolus, my basal test ends.",28d

Hopefully one of the experienced people will be along. I would guess that becomes a part of your basal testing. You would correct that and move on. If you can eat a decent meal mid afternoon and do the miss the evening meal basal test again. If the rise is similar every time, add to your pump hourly basal rate for that dawn phenomenon time period. A CGM or even Libra would be a big help while you do this. To see the time it starts to rise and to set from. Saves setting the alarm clock to test. The goal would be to pretreat it, so you don’t wake up high, if it’s a similar rise every morning.

1202,Is it basal or bolus dosage that is wrong?,Diabetes Technology,TapestryType 1 or LADA,1,"@tedos  What you need to do is written about in the basal testing link I posed earlier from Integrated Diabetes.  When you go low or high during your basal testing, you cancel the test, decrease or increase accordingly, and then start the test again.
I know you said you’ve already read the link on basal testing and Gary Scheiner’s book, Think Like a Pancreas, but it would be worth a second look :).

If your blood sugar drops by more than 30 mg/dl during the test period, the basal rate is probably too high.  If it rises by more than 30 mg/dl, the rate may be too low.  The basal rate should be changed in increments of .05 to .2 units/hr depending on your usual settings and the magnitude of the rise or drop that took place.  The next day, re-test to see whether the adjustment produces a steadier blood glucose level.  Continue to adjust and re-test until steady blood glucose levels are obtained.
…
Note that basal rates are usually changed one or two hours prior to an observed rise or fall in the blood sugar, since the rapid-acting insulin infused by the pump takes about an hour to peak.  For example, if your blood sugar rises between 3 am and 7 am, you would increase the basal rate between 2 am and 6 am.  Also, keep in mind that it is rare to have multiple “peaks” and “valleys” to a basal insulin program.  The vast majority of people require one peak and one valley.
Fine-tuning basal insulin can be complex. Don’t hesitate to reach out to a member of Integrated Diabetes Services’ clinical team for a helping hand. Our phone number is: 877-735-3648

But when my BG is sitting around +/- 10mmol(180mg), my corrections doesn’t seem to make the slightest impact.  If my correction was supposed to be say 0.5units, I seem to need to be injecting an extra 3 units (and I do this manually with a pen syringe to rule out site and insulin issues) before it starts to come down and even then it falls short of  landing at my target BG.  Particularly during night time where I struggle with the reduction in BG the most.
My correction factor is already strong sitting at 1u:2mmol/L (32mg), I’m not sure whether I should make it any stronger, when its combined with a bolus for a meal, it seems to be okay but when I’m just correcting a BG without bolusing for food, it struggles.

Yeah I was so excited when I had days of consistency. You would think overnight would be the easiest to test as there is no food and IOB is zero, some nights I’m travelling steady, others I drift low, I’ve had nights where in climb too!!  I can’t win.
I had the same breakfast over two consecutive days without exercise.  One day, my BG came down nicely and stayed steady around 100mg,  the next day I was sure I would nail it.  But my BG just kept rising and I had to bolus twice to get it back down.

If he’s diagnosed with diabetes, he’ll never be able to get new insurance again, but the company we have now is treating us horribly. American health insurance is tragic, but that’s not the topic here. So help me out with this doctor-less diabetes treatment situation.
His numbers have been below 200, but above 130 after meals. He’s making some huge changes to his diet with my help, and has started eating low carb and started to exercise more. This seems to be helping, and he’s losing weight.
But I think it might not be enough; I think he will need to go on medication. Without a doctor in the picture, this is problematic. I subscribe to Jenny’s view in her truth about oral diabetic drugs article (http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14045911.php 1), wherein metformin isn’t an effective way to prevent the onset of diabetes. It just masks the onset. Instead, I like acarbose, and I want to start him on it. I understand that patients start off taking 25 mg of acarbose 3 times a day (eaten with the first bite of every meal) and then adjust their dose thereafter, up to 50mg and then no more than 100mg. Possible side effects include gas and diarrhea, which can be limited by eating less carbs and especially less wheat. It should be avoided if there are problems with “iron deficiency, kidney disease, liver disease, stomach/digestive or intestinal disorders, any allergies.” It interferes with “‘water pills’ (diuretics), thyroid hormone, steroids, digoxin, estrogen hormone, birth control pills, phenytoin, isoniazid, other drugs that treat diabetes, phenothiazines (e.g., chlorpromazine), niacin, adrenalin-like drugs (e.g., albuterol, metaproterenol, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine), calcium blockers (e.g., nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem), certain digestive aids (e.g., amylase, pancreatin).” Used alone, there should be no hypos, but we’ll start checking his blood sugar more often and be prepared for it.

Maybe I went into this without understanding the dynamics of how the pump really works or maybe I have unrealistic expectations but, OMG, I am so stressed seeing my numbers after I eat! They are HIGHER than when I was injecting 6-8 times daily. Is this normal or should I be looking at other data to see that this is the correct treatment modality for me?
I have my first cartridge and tubing change tomorrow. I am mildly concerned. Is it normal to discard this much insulin? I currently have 145 units of insulin in the cartridge. It seems like such a waste. And, lets face it, insulin isn’t cheap. I have a $90 month co-pay.
I had 1 hour of training on this thing so I’m sure there is A LOT I don’t know. The clinical educator at the endo office could not get the Tslim to pair with my phone and connect to the TConnect app. Then again, he was genuinely confused when I asked him a question re: the pump and FOTF. He asked me what FOTF was. Makes me think maybe I should seriously consider getting my certificate in Diabetes Education. I called Tandem and they got me paired up to the app and running. The endo educator told me there were only three things I needed to know about/use on the pump. Oh boy. I feel woefully underprepared.
Last night, I told the pump the amount of carbs to bolus for my meal. The screen said “bolus infusing” and I put the pump in a shirt pocket (I stole hubs shirt…it’s huge on me. He’s a 5x but it had a pocket!). I checked after my meal and the pump said “Bolus not delivered”. IDK why. I really wasn’t sure what to do. My BG was already rising from the meal and wasn’t sure if I put the same number of carbs in the pump if it would cause a low or if IQ would adjust, so I told the pump 8 carbs less than I actually ate. What do you folks do when you encounter such issues? Why wasn’t the bolus delivered? What do you do if you forget to bolus before the meal?
I would appreciate any tips, tricks, advice that you, the community, has to offer this newbie. It’s silly things that trip me up…like getting dressed this morning.

I would start out by adjusting it 5% lower right off the bat.  Such as, if you currently have 1 unit:50mg/dl programmed, I would change it to 1:47.5 .  You can see, it’s a small change.  It’s not going to matter much in the long run if you overshoot your target BG by 2.5mg/dl, but it empowers the system significantly.  You may ultimately make much larger adjustments, but that’s a good place to start.
Also, you don’t have to change your cartridge at the same time as your infusion set.  Insulin does degrade in the cartridge, though.  Most users report zero issues with a week of use, though.  What you do is just insert a new infusion set and remove the tubing.  You probably want to save it somewhere clean, like in a ziploc bag.  Plug in the old tubing that’s still connected to your cartridge. Now go into the load screen and do nothing but click on the “fill cannula” option.
Options > Load > Fill cannula > All deliveries will be stopped.  Continue?  ✓ > Start > ✓ in the top right corner > Resume insulin now? ✓
You likewise don’t have to change your infusion set when you change the cartridge.  That’s why you want to save the unused tubing.
I’m with you on the insulin is money thing, too.  There is actually about 15 units of unusable insulin left in every cartridge.  This is a complete renegade move and you’ll have to decide if it’s worth it to you, but a lot of us actually suck that 15+ units out with the syringe and add it to a new cartridge along with fresh insulin.  Insulin degrades, though, so this move has mixed feelings.  Personally, I don’t have any issue doing it.
Also, the pump doesn’t have to live in a pocket.  My preferred location is right between my breasts.  I can clip it to the bridge of my bra if I’m wearing one, or to the neckline of the tank I’m usually wearing wearing if not a bra. You can also clip it onto the waistband of your bottoms. You can buy or make waist pouches, garter belts, arm bands, etc…  Another lesser known option: Get yourself some baby socks, readily available at the Dollar store, and a safety pin.  Pin the sock inside any clothing item that doesn’t have a pocket, and slip your pump into the makeshift baby sock pocket.  Works best without the case on it.",9d

 SusanS:

Is it normal to discard this much insulin? I currently have 145 units of insulin in the cartridge. It seems like such a waste.


I consider it a waste and I have never discarded my current insulin reservoir when changing an infusion site unless the reservoir was empty. You can prep a new infusion set by skipping the “Change Cartridge” step in the “Load” menu. Just disconnect your old set, connect your new one and select “Fill Tubing”. At least that’s what I did for my last site change.



 SusanS:

I checked after my meal and the pump said “Bolus not delivered”. IDK why. I really wasn’t sure what to do.


Check the “History” section on your pump for error messages that might give you a clue as to why the bolus was not delivered. Also, double check your “Insulin on Board” (IOB) to double check how much of the bolus was delivered.
You can enter a bolus by simply specifying how many units of insulin you want to deliver. Figure out how many units you wanted to deliver to cover your meal, subtract any that may have already been delivered, and then just bolus that number of units. You do not need to specify carbs when you bolus.
The pump will treat it as a “correction” bolus, but that’s OK. This way you avoid double counting the carbs.",9d

This may be of no use to you, but I had problems figuring out how to remove/relocate the metal clip on the back of the t:slim case. The link below is to a post I made that points to the (slightly outdated) Tandem training video about how to do this. If it helps, great. If not, just ignore.

1249,My first pump,Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,1,"Just thought of another forewarned newbie thing.  When you do change your cartridge, don’t panic when it shows you an unusually small amount of insulin.  It makes a general guess, and will say something like “120+” or “180+” until the pump delivers ten units of insulin.  After it’s delivered those 10 units it will give you a better approximation, but it’s still a rounded value.  It doesn’t start counting down in single units until you get down to the bottom of the cartridge.",9d

he was genuinely confused when I asked him a question re: the pump and FOTF.


If you had referred to it as somewhat similar to “Dawn Phenomenon” chances are he would have had a better idea what you were talking about. Just because it’s discussed in the Diabetes Online Community (DOC) does not necessarily mean it’s a term your medical support folk will know about.
Of course, someone is going to post a reply telling me that FOTF is different from DP. OK, fine. But my guess is that it’s related. I would also guess that the way you’d want to deal with it is to bolus for it before you get up. ",9d

1255,My first pump,Diabetes Technology,SusanS,5,"OK. I have no idea how to make setting changes or what my settings are. All I know is that my target BG is 112. IDK if that is a preset standard number or if the endo educator programmed that number in. I also see that IQ does not dose additional insulin unless I am over 150-155. I did not get any insulin the past 2 nights because my BG was in the 130s. Prior to starting a pump, my morning sugar was 110s to 130s. I have been 140s to 150s the past 2 mornings. Post meal, my sugars were <170 just about 100% of the time. Since pump, I am seeing 170 to 200+. I guess my A1C will be going up.
I guess I will have to look at videos. I hate watching “educational videos” because people speak too slowly. I always hated classroom learning for the same reason. Guess I need to get over myself, put on the big girl panties and suck it up.
I just called tandem because I got a message that my pump stopped delivering insulin. They explained it to me and it’s working again. But they offered to have one of their local educators reach out to me to set up a session. I am taking them up on it and I will make a list of questions.  ",8d
1256,My first pump,Diabetes Technology,Sally7,2,"My suggestion here is meet with a pump trainer not a CDE. My CDE had never worked with a Tandem pump so she sat in on my training session with the pump trainer. I have meet with my pump trainer a few times over the years.
Once just to go over how to set up computer to pull reports. This was before being able to look at pump settings on my phone. I have also meet with them on infusion set issues.
And I am sorry but the first lesson is really just getting the pump fired up and working. There is no training on what the pump can actually do. I mean who was taught back in the day about extended bolus during your first session?
So first off, welcome to the pumpers club. And I hope you didn’t think it was the cure for all that causes you problems with your diabetes. It took me about 6 months to finally start feeling ok with it but that was 20+ years ago and things are a lot easier now.
And sorry about the post meal surprises. But that and overnight were the main reason for me to finally switch from 5 shots a day to a pump. I so wanted to have a baby. And thankfully the pump and a lot of hard work made that possible.
Hang in there. It will get easier. And remember what works for me might not work for you. Each of us is an experiment in the making. But I do really suggest asking for a one on one session with your pump trainer, not the sales rep. They have all the tricks that they have learned from others over the years.
Good luck! And I will say, this system has made my life so much easier. I really don’t think much about my diabetes throughout the day! And after 50 years, I am so ready for easier!",8d

Personally, I think you would benefit greatly by reading something like Pumping Insulin by John Walsh and Ruth Roberts.  It’s pretty much the pumpers handbook, and will be the best way to educate yourself since your management team is lacking.  You might even be able to find it in your library.

It’s pretty obvious your basal rates are too low.  I think it’s normal for them to start low and increase it as necessary, though.  Doctors are much more afraid of lows than highs.  It isn’t a problem so much in the short term, but if they make you wait much more than a week to adjust your settings, it IS a problem.
We can help you right now with your morning sugars, though.
Did they not teach you about sleep mode?  Sleep mode was designed to give the pump tighter control while you’re inactive and fasting, because there are no other external factors to screw with your insulin needs.  It will aggressively adjust your basal to keep you between 112-120 all night.  You can turn it on by clicking Options > Activity > Sleep: START.  The regular Control-IQ algorithm won’t resume until you follow the same pathway in the morning and click “STOP”.  While you’re in that activity menu, though, you’ll see an option for “Sleep Schedules”.  You have two different setting options, such as one for weekdays and a different one for weekends.  Go ahead and set up a schedule now that will turn Sleep mode on and off for you automatically.  I would highly suggest you set a time that begins about 2 hours after you usually finish your evening meal and extends to your typical breakfast time (this will also help cover dawn phenomenon and FOTF).
Unfortunately, your pump is going to struggle to achieve that goal just yet because your basal rate is inadequate.  I’m not comfortable advising you to change that, but you may call and ask your endo or educator to increase it for you, or you can take it upon yourself to raise it.  It’s generally accepted that 5% changes are safe and acceptable.  You run no risk of severe hypoglycemia with just a 5% change if you’re already running high.
The one thing I WILL help you with now that will make your nighttimes better is getting your correction factor down.  This is the setting that enables control-iq to influence your BG.  The higher the number, the slower and milder the changes.  The lower the number, the faster and more extreme the changes are.  (Edited, because I suck at proofreading.  Thanks @irrational_John ) Too low is a bad thing, though, as it will overcorrect at both highs and lows, leaving you on a wicked roller coaster ride.
Too change it, you need to learn about your “personal profiles”.  This is where all your background insulin settings are.  You can have up to six different profiles, because our insulin needs aren’t the same everyday.  You might need/want a different profile for high activity days, sick days, weekends vs weekdays, etc…  It’s fine to start with just one, though.  You don’t know yet when that particular profile isn’t working for you until you have more time with it.  (Personally, I have 3.  My regular profile, one that delivers extra insulin for sick days, pms, etc…, and 1 that delivers less insulin for really high activity days when I otherwise might fight lows a lot.)
Click on Options > My Pump > Personal Profiles.
The first item on this list is “pump settings”.  There’s nothing too important in there other than it lets you customize how much insulin is delivered if you “quick bolus”, which I’m guessing they didn’t teach you about either.  I have mine set to 0.5 units.  If you hold the silver button until it beeps or vibrates (depending on your sound settings), you will see the Quick Bolus screen pop up.  Every further click of the button will tell the pump to deliver some insulin.  Since I have mine set to 0.5 units, if I want to deliver a 2.5 unit bolus, I would click the button 5 times.  The pump will then repeat 5 beeps or vibrations back at me and I will long press the silver button to confirm.  It’s easier than it sounds.  Do it a few times watching the screen and you’ll catch on quick.  This allows for discreet bolusing without even removing your pump, because you don’t actually have to see or touch the screen.
The second item on the list will be the only basal profile you currently have set up.  It should say “on” next to it.  Go ahead and click on it.  If you scroll down to the second page, you can rename that profile to something more helpful.  I would suggest “starter”, because you want to save the initial settings your doctor gave you.
Now scroll back up the first page and click “duplicate”.  This will initiate a new profile great you can tweak without affecting your doctor’s settings.  Click the check mark to confirm you want to do this.  I would call it something like “testing”.
Click anywhere in the box labeled “timed settings”.  This is the heart of your pump.  I’m guessing you only have 1 segment at the moment, starting at midnight.  Eventually, you will want to add other segments where you need different amounts of insulin, such as a higher one in the early am to account for dawn phenomenon, and then a reduced one the after the DP passes and you don’t need the extra.  You can see right in that 12:00 am box what the basal rate, correction factor, insulin:carb ratio, and target BG are set at.  If you want to edit it, click on that box.  Click on “correction factor”.  Whatever that number is, reduce it by 5%.  You can use a calculator if you want, (current correction factor value) x 0.95 = new correction factor value.  Once you enter the new value, click the ✓ to confirm.  Click the check again to save the new timed segment information.
Now, you need to actually turn your new “testing” profile on.  Click on “testing” (or whatever you named it), and then click on “activate”.  ✓ to confirm.  You’re now running your newly adjusted profile.
Note, I feel comfortable guiding you on this because it’s a SAFER option than the inadequate starter settings your doctor set you up with.  It will make Control-IQ better at preventing both highs and lows.  I also think it’s an option most professionals, except the very best, ignore.  Generally, they only change insulin values, even though it’s only one of many factors that influence pumping.  You should confidence to make small 5% changes, and see for a week or so how they work for you.",8d

 SusanS:

OK. I have no idea how to make setting changes or what my settings are.


Here’s a link to a Tandem vid about setting up personal profiles.
Getting Started with Personal Profiles on the t:slim X2
Editing your pump settings is not that hard to understand, but it can be a tedious process. Just something we all have to deal with. 
This video discusses creating the very first profile on the pump. Since your trainer already set that up, it is too early for you. But it will you point you towards how to view or edit your profile on your pump.
I suggest before you change your profile settings you first duplicate (copy) them into a profile with a different name. This saves the old settings for future reference. It also makes it easy to switch back to the old settings should you want to.
Always look at the date of any tutorial material you come across. In my experience the older Tandem stuff can be out of date. As it updated the pump’s software over time, Tandem also changed the pump’s menus. Older educational material may still be of use to you, but it won’t necessarily match the screens of the t:slim x2 you are using. You’ll need to allow for that.
Tandem also has a collection of user guides & Quick Reference sheets in PDF format which you can refer too. For example, here is a link to the quick ref for t:slim x2 user profiles.
As with the videos, keep in mind that some of the material may be out of date compared to the version of the pump you are using.",8d

Nice to know that I’m already (self)trained.  
I guess I just have a different perspective than many others. My first pump was a MiniMed 507 which was delivered to me along with supplies in December 1996. Included with it was a book containing a number of articles about using an insulin pump. After reading through some of the articles and the pump’s documentation, I took a guess at a basil rate, filled a cartridge with insulin, slapped in an infusion set and started using the pump.
A week or three later I went in for an appointment with the educator at the office of the doctor I was seeing then. She was surprised when she found out I was already wearing/using my pump. That was how I first found out that folks are supposed to be “trained” to use a pump.

Yet resilience can never emerge without adversity. For us, diabetes has supplied that adversity, often more than we’d like.
Since I live alone, I now spend long periods unpunctuated with regular human face-to-face contact. I rely on long phone calls and a few zoom calls  to mitigate my aloneness. It’s not ideal but reality can force us to adjust and wise adjustments define resilience.
I feel buoyed by two ongoing worldwide events as I hide from this pandemic: a SpaceX mission and Vendee Globe, a single-handed around-the-world sailboat race.
SpaceX just launched a crew of astronauts to the International Space Station a few days ago. That crew deliberately chose to name their space capsule, Resilience. In interviews the crew acknowledged the broader social context of pandemic, political disagreement, and racial justice as motivation for their choice of naming their mission.
In a press conference featuring the five astronauts this morning, their common acknowledgment of their respect for science seems poignant to me. It makes a whole lot of sense in this setting. Respect for science forms the basis for their immediate survival.
Science also provides the basis for our survival in this pandemic. While many things remain unknown about our future in the next year or two, I confidently see the product of science, a vaccine, will be our common lifeline. Even our crude tools to manage our time without a vaccine, widespread mask-wearing, keeping physical distance, and washing our hands all give a respectful nod to scientific reality.
The Vendee Globe sailboat race starts and ends in France and will take place over the next three months, starting just over one week ago. Single-handing a sailboat all the way around the world, particularly its course through the Southern Ocean, is built on resilience. The sailors, both men and women, all must be resilient as they must rely on their personal resources, both mental and physical, to complete this grueling challenge.
The last 37 years of my life since a T1D diagnosis, is built on the foundation of many scientific achievements: the discovery of insulin and the technology to produce it, blood glucose test strips and the meters to read them, insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors, and automated insulin dosing systems.
I realize that resilience goes well beyond the scope of science but I find the interplay between science and human resilience an inspiring one.",Nov '20

All they have to do is process 1 form. But, they can’t or wont. So, I have to spend months of relentless effort. They tell me I have to go to the legislature and change laws in order to make it not be this way anymore. I am only 1 person and I cannot keep making up for all the failures of so many other people and entire systems. They almost brought me to my knees this year.
Finally, at the end of business day, some nurse found one of the many, many forms I had submitted and promised that they would call me tomorrow.

1299,The impact of insulin rationing on mental health,Treatment,MilaStaff,,"WRITTEN BY: T’ara Smith, MS, Nutrition Education
“Will I be able to pay all of my bills this month?”
It’s a question people with diabetes who ration insulin have to ask themselves when it’s time to choose between refilling a prescription and paying bills.
Insulin rationing is, unfortunately, a reality for people living with diabetes — both Type 1 and Type 2. A 2017 study showed 1 in 4 people with diabetes has rationed their insulin due to financial hardship. Rationing insulin includes underusing the prescribed amount of insulin needed to maintain glucose control, not filling a prescription, limiting carbohydrate intake, or stopping it altogether. Unsurprisingly, it is likely to lead to poorer glycemic management and can lead to death from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) 1, particularly in people with Type 1 diabetes. Not only does insulin rationing have a major impact on physical health, but it also takes a toll on one’s mental and emotional health.
It certainly makes sense, right? The costs of insulin have skyrocketed over the years, tripling over the past decade. In general, financial distress is strongly associated with depressive symptoms. 
People living with diabetes are already reminded of their disease every day. The stress of worrying whether or not you can literally afford to live is just one more addition to the already enormous mental health burden of living with a chronic disease.
“People with diabetes most often ration insulin because of cost, which is influenced by having no insurance, being underinsured, and family priorities,” said clinical psychologist Alicia McAuliffe-Fogarty, Ph.D., who also lives with Type 1 diabetes. “Nowadays, we have increased costs of medications, co-pays, and insurance, as well as the cost of living. So often people have to make these hard decisions: do I feed my kids? Can we survive without water and electricity this month so I can get insulin? These are decisions no one should have to make as insulin is a life-sustaining medication and without it, people will die.”
People with Diabetes Have Increased Risks for Anxiety and Depression
People with diabetes are two to three times more likely to suffer from depression and have elevated rates of anxiety, as I know all too well. For me, insulin rationing exacerbated my anxiety surrounding my diabetes.
The year I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, I was set to age out of my mother’s insurance several months later.  One of my major concerns was being able to afford my Lantus prescription. It had only been $25 under my mom’s insurance plan, but the list price without insurance was $400-$500. I knew I had to find a way to get covered, so I took out a loan to get insurance through my school. Unfortunately, insulin was still hundreds of dollars with my new coverage, so there were weeks I went without taking my insulin consistently until I was able to get Basaglar. The thought of suffering from complications, specifically a stroke or a heart attack, weighed heavily on my mind for months. It made living with diabetes more difficult, even scary.
Unhealthy and Healthy Coping Mechanisms to Insulin Rationing
There are healthy ways to cope with diabetes distress, such as getting support from professionals and loved ones and prioritizing self-care. But not all coping mechanisms are healthy. McAuliffe-Fogarty has seen patients resort to substance abuse, suffer from eating disorders such as anorexia, using expired insulin, dropping out of school, and forgoing opportunities to afford insulin.
“No one wants diabetes. It interferes with your life in every way,” said McAuliffe-Fogarty. “People with diabetes experience more mental health issues than people without diabetes, especially depression, which makes it more difficult for them to manage their disease. Often people try to escape or self-treat how they are feeling (e.g., sad, anxious, etc), and develop unhealthy coping methods. People with diabetes need to be treated as a whole person, both their physical and mental/emotional well-being. This includes their diabetes management, how they are feeling and functioning in other aspects of their life – their family life, ability to access basic necessities of food, clothing, shelter, medication, etc. to prevent and/or treat these issues.”
She also notes how people who struggle to obtain insulin won’t waste it even if it’s expired because it’s such a valued commodity. Any individual would take expired insulin to stay alive, especially if they’re already making other sacrifices in other parts of their lives and those of their families.
“These sacrifices include parents not taking the jobs they want, not being able to send their kids to dance lessons, not being able to take vacations, and making career decisions to get health insurance — all because they need to pay for diabetes supplies including insulin,” said McAuliffe-Fogarty, who will soon publish a study on this subject.
And for people who are hesitant to ask for help? Some may be too proud to do it, according to McAuliffe-Fogarty, and forgo basic necessities such as insulin. She’s also seen patients ration insulin, eat fewer carbs, and exercise more to avoid asking for help.
“The stress of the cost of insulin stresses people out and to add insult to injury, further increases their blood sugar,” said McAuliffe-Fogarty. “Also, in many cultures, it is embarrassing and taboo to ask for financial help, so people don’t. They often feel guilty of being a burden on their family and try to make do with what they have. Accessing life-sustaining drugs is a huge issue in this country and should not be this difficult for people to stay alive.”
How Health Providers Can Help Relieve Distress from Insulin Rationing
At the end of the day, insulin should be easily accessible, period. Being able to take insulin as prescribed,  is self-care, and reduces the stress of having to make life-or-death decisions. McAuliffe-Fogarty gives some practical tips she offers her patients to deal with diabetes distress from insulin rationing, tips from which other healthcare professionals, including primary care physicians, could use.
“If patients cannot afford insulin or access it, we make that a priority, whether it’s problem-solving on how to pay, calling the patient assistance programs right there or calling to ask for help from some non-profit organizations,” said McAuliffe-Fogarty. “The process that pharmaceutical companies have to provide financial assistance is getting a little easier but it still requires some work and documentation proof on the part of the patient. Often people don’t know what they are asking for or fill out the forms wrong, so making this a priority and doing it correctly with the patient so they get their insulin is important. Also discussing options such as the lower cost Walmart-brand insulins to tie them over is of discussion. We, including myself in the 1980s, used these types of insulin for years, and are still healthy. Although not ideal to use them with the newer insulin on the market, according to the data our A1cs weren’t much different sadly. So using these insulins is a very viable option for people.”
She also suggested doctors need to do more than simply asking patients if they need more refills for medications and getting frustrated with patients who don’t follow their recommendations. Doctors should also be inquiring if a patient is experiencing issues paying for those medications. For example, McAuliffe-Fogarty recalls seeing Type 2 patients who need insulin but remain on metformin because that’s all they can afford.
A Mental Burden People with Diabetes Shouldn’t Have to Bear
There’s no need to lecture or shame a person with diabetes on how insulin rationing is “wrong,” either. People with diabetes would always rather have an abundance of insulin than worry about where, when, and how the next batch of insulin vials or pens are coming. Those with diabetes don’t underutilize our prescribed insulin because we like seeing high blood glucose numbers and the other physical effects of hyperglycemia. There is no joy in making the tough decision to forgo insulin until the next pay cycle in order to pay rent or buy groceries (that some don’t even have enough insulin to bolus for!)
These decisions can have deadly consequences. Notable stories include Alec Smith, who died in 2017 at the age of 26, after he was no longer covered by his mother’s insurance; Jada Louis, who had to choose between paying her rent or $300 for insulin 1 and passed at the age of 24 after being hospitalized for DKA; and Meaghan Carter, a 47-year-old nurse with no health insurance, who died alone on her sofa on Christmas Day in 2018 3.
We live in the age of “self-care,” where we’re inundated with memes and colorful Instagram graphics on how to manage stress and protect our mental health. For people with diabetes, included in that self-care routine is knowing we have enough insulin to live to see and  enjoy  another day without undue financial burden. It also means reaching out for help and seeking help from a mental health professional and having access to resources to help us get insulin when we need it. It also means  not  falling into the traps of unhealthy coping mechanisms such: as starvation, substance abuse, and forgoing other positive quality of life goals.
Rationing insulin because there’s no other option is a life-or-death issue. Life with diabetes, in general, already has its ups and downs. But, shouldering those ups and downs with the uncertainty of being able to consistently get vital medication to survive is a mental and emotional burden no person with diabetes should have to bear.",May '20

1333,How to speed up your insulin absorption,Type 1 and LADA,obxdiva,1,Smaller boluses will be absorbed more uniformly. Let’s say I need a large bolus. As it gets larger it absorbs more erratically so you might not get a consistent effect. If the same amount is split into smaller boluses they have more spherical surface area under your skin so they will absorb more uniformly.  This aspect is seen more often in insulin resistant folks who need larger doses and at some point they still can’t get good control. Moving to a concentrated insulin = smaller boluses and more reliable results. Faster overall? Could be by having more surface volume. I have not seen speed versus bolus size specifically addressed.

I’ve gone through the various threads on restarting a sensor and I understand there are various ways to restart a sensor, what worked initially stopped working over time.  I gather the removing the transmitter method is the most up to date and attempts have been made to restart the 8L***** successfully.

Stop sensor
Remove transmitter
Wait 30 - 60 mins
Insert transmitter
Start sensor using original sensor QR code

On step 1, do you wait for it to expire automatically then stop or stop it before it dies?
I’m assuming all the steps above are done using the dexcom app.  What do I need to do on the pump? Do I need to stop and start the sensor on there as well?  Edit - I’m on the TSlim pump",Oct '20

All of the steps you listed will work on current transmitters and sensors except I haven’t ever waited an entire hour to restart the sensor. I don’t restart sensors regularly but did last week since there was a mix up with my shipment and I didn’t want to be down to my last sensor. I removed the transmitter and waited 15 minutes (timed it on my phone) then reinserted the transmitter and started it up as usual. You can manually stop the sensor or wait for it to expire on it’s own.
There may be a big difference from the new reading versus a finger stick so in my experience I will calibrate it in sections of no more than 35mg/dl or about 2mmol/l at a time. This is important or you will get calibration errors and those are annoying. Good luck!",Oct '20

Is that right


Nope. 
If honestly doesn’t matter which device you use first.  There are people who do it either way.  Personally, I chose to do all starts on the pump, just so there’s a record of it, since I use a 3rd party app, but it doesn’t matter.  For Tandem users, I would suggest using the pump for starts just because the “scan the 4 digit code with your camera instead of manually entering it” feature of the app is glitchy.  You run the risk of being forced to calibrate twice a day (and potentially miss pump intervention when the sensor is waiting for the calibration) if you use this glitchy feature.
One of the things that DOES matter, though, is that you only enter the startup code into the first device, then choose “no code” for the second device.
Also, there is zero need to wait 60 minutes.  People keep “padding” the time, just to be sure.  And then the next person who follows their instructions also pads the time, and it’s compounding in their repeated instructions.  You only need 15 minutes, but the timing is important.  14 minutes and 59 seconds may not work for you, and it won’t work if you stay timing before you remove the transmitter.  Both of which are common mistakes.
There should also be a step where you clean the contacts (the 2 metal polka dots) of both sensor and transmitter.  Any gunk that’s accumulated in there can cause sensor errors.  I start the timer after I do this very quick step, because it pads the timer for a few seconds to ensure I wait more than the minimum 15 minutes.


Stop sensor on both devices, or wait for the session to expire naturally on both devices.


Remove transmitter using a tear-drop shaped hair clip (the ones you bend to snap shut), guitar pick, or test strip.


Clean the metal contacts on both the sensor and transmitter with an alcohol pad.


Set timer for 15 minutes.


After the timer expires, and not a moment before, reinsert the transmitter and start the sensor on your first device.  (Starting on the T:slim X2 is my personal preference)


Enter the startup code.  Those of us that do restarts will usually take a photo of the startup code to reference here.  I’ve also started taking a picture of the lot number and expiration on the back of the plastic packaging in case there’s a problem and tech support asks for this. You can also choose “no code”, but you will be required to enter 2 calibrations immediately after warmup and an additional 2 calibrations every day for the rest of this session. The benefit of “no code” is that it avoids the hassle of step 8…


Start the session on your second device, if using, using the “no code” option.  It will join the session already running.


After the 2 hour warmup, your first reading WILL be high.  Maybe VERY high.   Anyone using Control-IQ, or other automated system, should turn it off, so the pump doesn’t deliver a false correction bolus.  You will have to calibrate, but do so carefully.  BIG jumps may lead to rejected calibrations. I try to use a “rule of 40”.  You don’t want to calibrate more than 40mg/dl (2.2 mmol) or 40% of the false high G6 reaching, whichever one is SMALLER.  In this instance, it’s nearly always going to be the 40mg/dl (2.2 mmol).  Note: the error seems to be less when my BG is close to my lower range limit


If you have to more than 1 calibration because the difference was more than 40mg/dl (2.2 mmol), wait at least 15 minutes (3 data dots) to do the next calibration.

Thanks for the details that was very helpful!
Regarding this comment, I’m curious whether it makes a difference.  When I started my first sensor session last week, the DE got me to enter in the code into my pump and then scan the code in for my phone.  This means I must have chosen the use code option.

 tedos:

Most definitely NOT.
The first day wonkiness has more to do with your body’s reaction to the trauma of the insertion than anything wrong with the programming.  You will have to calibrate it, and there’s zero reason to wait.  You just have to do so gently.
As to entering the startup code twice…  Admittedly, I’ve entered it in both pump and app, too, with no dire consequences.  It’s come up quite a few times with Tandem’s tech support, though.  Somewhere in their training, they’re taught that it does matter, though I personally have no idea why.  Since there’s so much debate about what causes the system to misbehave, I figure it’s just worthwhile to pay attention to this as a possible contributing factor.  



 tedos:

You can’t really screw up the algorithm with insulin delivered AFTER a calibration.  But if you require multiple calibrations (my first reading can easily come in 100mg/dl higher than reality, that’s too big of a difference and would get rejected if I did it all in one calibration), you CAN screw up the next calibration you’re waiting to do.
In a perfect world, you shouldn’t require a correction while you’re trying to get your newly restarted sensor calibrated back in line.  I’ve developed a weird quirk of doing more fingersticks in my two warmup hours without data than I used to do in a single day.  I strive REALLY hard to be between 80-100 mg/dl (4.4-5.5 mmol) when the first data point registers… Soley because it makes calibration easier.  So my corrections have been done and stabilized before I get to this point.
In an imperfect world where you need the correction bolus… If you’re high, I think that correction is more important than getting your Dexcom pretty and aligned.  Go ahead and bolus.  Technically the calibration rules still apply (in range and steady), do it’s best to just ignore the data until you can get to a point where you meet the calibration rules.  I’ve been known to break them on occasion, though, because I’m impatient.  Just know that if you break the rules, your information will be off and require more calibrations later to bully it back in line.
Honestly, it’s all this first day of a restart calibration fussiness that has taught me the right behavior for calibrating and not to fear it.  Those who aren’t restarting and haven’t been through this many calibrations just don’t have the experience with it to know the little innuendos.  It sounds complicated to write it all out, but the reality is that it becomes intuitive quickly.
It IS intimidating and annoying, though, especially at first.  You kind of have to decide which is the better annoyance for you.  Would you rather have a BIG annoyance that only lasts a short time before the dex falls back in line, or would you do better with a small but contestant annoyance?  If the latter is your preference, then choose the “no code” start up and do the mandatory 2 calibrations a day.  The flat and steady calibration rules still apply.  Personally, I think it’s easier to wrestle it back in line at the beginning and not have to worry about it again.",Oct '20

One thing that happened was my sugars were stubborn all afternoon so it has been sitting around the 11 mmol/196mg mark for about 3 hours.  While this is out of range, its not terribly high. But not sure whether this is the cause of the problem because the inaccuracy happened after this 3 hours when my sugars were starting to come down.

 tedos:

Is it common for the sensor reading to be out on the last day?


I can’t say I’ve noticed this, no.
The Dexcom algorithm sort of smooths everything out, though.  It uses the previous two values to help figure out where to plot the next graph point.  If your sugar is changing rapidly, the graph much be a little off, but catch up in a few plot points.
Most commonly, inaccuracies are just due to dehydration.  Could you have forgotten to drink your water?  You’ve got to be hydrated the you to have movement in the interstitial fluid the Dexcom measures.
It’s possible you could be nearing the end of your sensor life, too.  I do find i need more calibrations in the end to bully it into line.  I did my 2nd restart yesterday, putting me at day 21, and now I’m in the phase where I’ll fingerstick at least once a day just to check if it’s drifting.  Until you get those post-prandial figured out, you won’t get the crazy long sensor life.  It’s still worth trying the restart, though.
You’re still doing fingersticks anyway, right?  I’d go ahead and just do the “no code” option for this first sensor at least.  It will require two calibrations a day, but it won’t fight you on them. And then you’ll be able to really see how long your sensor will last, Sir we know if end-of-life is an issue.",Oct '20

Typically you should always enter the code on first use of sensor.  You should be prompted for it during start, or you choose no code.

A little history, have been T2D for over 20 years, diagnosed in my early 30’s, I’m now 51. I’ve been through most oral meds, Bydureon, Byetta, and have been on Lantus for about 7 years and recently added Januvia 100mg to the Lantus 30units taken in the morning. Most recent A1C in June was 7.
The main reason for my post is in the past year or so I’ve had 4 or 5 severe lows after dosing my Lantus. For example:
805pm - 160
854pm- 36
This scares the crap out of me. The most recent one was two weeks ago and again, large, fast drop in a short time frame.
My doctor recently switched me to Tresiba and have been taking 26 units in the morning along with the 100mg Januvia. I experience DP and have been running around 150-180 fasting, which I know is high. But I’m scared sh*tless when it comes times to dose Tresiba. Shaking and testing every 3-4 minutes until I’m convinced my sugar isn’t going to crash.
I don’t want to live this way. I need to rebuild trust but I’m at a loss how to do that. I also would like some answers about why my BS dropped so fast with Lantus. My PA-C and endo are both puzzled. I have thoughts about this but…sorry, it just sucks.

Well, you get the idea. A hundred and one things including your diabetes pills all affect your blood glucose. Have you thought about using a continuous glucose monitor?

Your endo and PA can only make guesses after you give them the rough details of what happened after a scary low. The CGM will warn you in real time that you’re about to walk over a cliff.
After 37 years of using insulin, I think flying blind without a CGM is a poor choice and risky business. I apologize if my strong opinion may offend; I’ve crashed and burned too many times. If you use insulin, you will eventually go low. There’s no getting around that.

I don’t feel bad about these numbers.
We are in such a high risk time that running a little higher might be preferable than running on the low side (especially if you have seen some disruptive/concerning lows).
I’ve been running aggressive insulin dosages that put me on the low side and I have also had some severe lows during the pandemic. I don’t think that was practical. I now believe that I was being a little irresponsible, given the current state of the world.

1384,T2 diabetes and anxiety,Type 2,jean63,1,"I guess I’ll chime in on the CGM cheerleading team. I was surprised when my docs wanted me on a CGM even before they had me on insulin but I am so glad I went ahead and got one. I rarely get low’s, especially at night, but one night my alarm went off at 70 saying I’d be at 55 in ten minutes. Maybe you could set your low alarm a little higher, that way, you have time to react and treat. My sugars usually are high at night, so I don’t know why I had a low  like that. Also, they loosen the guidelines for blood sugar control for seniors because of low blood sugars. Low’s are particularly dangerous for those of us in our “golden years.” A blood sugar of 36 is very dangerous. I hope that never happens to you again. I wouldn’t dream of going on any kind of insulin without a CGM, specifically because of nighttime lows. Good luck to you.",19d
1385,T2 diabetes and anxiety,Type 2,cardamom,2,"The reason you were having those issues w Lantus is almost definitely specific to Lantus (and other biosimilar insulins) and how it works. When you inject Lantus, it crystallizes in your tissue due to pH differences in your body, and then those crystals dissolve slowly over about 20-24ish hours to work as insulin. That’s great when it works, but if you accidentally inject into a blood vessel, Lantus doesn’t crystallize properly and can instead all start working right away (or this may happen to some of the dose). Then instead of a gradual effect, you drop like a rock. Tresiba doesn’t work like this at all, which is probably why your doc switched you (neither does Levemir, but that tends to require 2x a day dosing). Do not worry about the same thing happening—it won’t. There is no way to use Tresiba that will result in a quick drop. That said, with Tresiba, you want to raise the dose very gradually, giving each adjustment 3-4 days to fully kick in, before raising again, because it is so long-lasting.
Also you may need a CGM, but you really may not, if the Lantus issue was the only time you had that kind of low. It will never hurt of course, and if you can get it great, but I don’t think from just what you’ve said alone you have reason to be anxious without it.
Good luck!",18d

You have NO idea how satisfying this is to have an answer vs my PA-C saying it was an “anomaly”. I am about 60 lbs overweight and never thought I could inject directly into a blood vessel due to having belly fat. I did take out a syringe and a pen needle and compare the two. Yes, the pen needle is about half the length of the syringe.

There are generally not any forbidden medications with insurance, but rather they have preferred ones you can get without jumping through hoops, and other ones that are not preferred require “prior authorization”.
The preferred drug list should provide notes on what is required to achieve prior authorization from the insurance company.  In my experience, it usually means you have to have tried all of the preferred drugs, and the treatment options “failed”.  My doctor says it’s pretty easy to declare treatments as “failed”, if you really want a non-preferred option.  Side effects like pain and/or irritation, nausea, or allergic reaction count; as do things like inability to comply with the prescription (a drug that requires 2 injections instead of 1 might mean you’re not able to take the second dose appropriately), and not being able to achieve treatment goals with the preferred medications.
There should be an online physician portal for your insurance company, where the doctor logs on to complete a prior authorization request (PAR), answers the questions, and submits for approval.  Done this way, it shouldn’t take more than a few days for a response.
This writing letters thing doesn’t sound like an appropriate nor effecient pathway.  Letters don’t mean a thing to insurance companies, except for maybe when you’re contesting a decision.

I have been a data nerd (15 to 20 manual BG readings per day). and excessive record keeper. I have a background in statistical analysis.  My control has been very good to excellent over time.
My take on the 670G  system at this point mirrors some of the comments in this thread, though my conclusion may be somewhat unorthodox , but follow me for a moment.
The sensor/transmitter, pump combination is the first generation of one companies attempt at a hybrid “closed loop” system.
The pump part of this system is fairly mature at this point, the stepping motors have gotten better able to deliver smaller and smaller amounts of insulin. The upgrades in pump technology has certainly allowed diabetics an opportunity at better control.
Medtronic has always offered terrific support, though now it seems they ARE following a script for the calls.
I have had my run ins with short sensor life (one lasted an entire thirty hours!), and multiple calls to the help line, at all hours of the day. I have had no trouble getting sensor replacements for my short lived sensors, using the initial online reporting that is allowed and followup calls.
My feeling about the entire system is that all of us using this system specifically the CGM are, that unwillingly, the current users, are still part of a beta test group.
I would like to tell Medtronic that I have incurred significant expenses to use their system, and if we are part of their product development they should minimize our costs. The original FDA approvals were certainly done in a clinical environment with little if no costs to the participants
My data, which used to be my own, is now visible to them, without using my password. I am sure that I “allowed” their access by signing in initially.
Medtronic has recently announced a collaboration/partnership with Dexcom, among others. This seems to be a tacit acknowledgement that there are better CGM platforms and that the next generation will abandon their own for a better one.  When and if that happens, sign me up, though I cant afford another sizable financial investment at this point.
I understand that we are all on the cusp of significantly better control. I was seduced by the idea that I might not have to put so much effort into my care, even if for a short period of time

1413,Compression Lows,Diabetes Technology,Jay6,,"This may be a new opening of an old wound. I have seen and heard of COMPRESSION LOWS rearing its ugly head this fall. I am trying to wrap my head around the term and what is happening in the body. Does this seem like a good description?
BACKGROUND: Compression lows are caused by the person’s body pressing against the mattress, pinning the CGM sensor/transmitter (CGM) between the person’s body and the mattress during sleep. First, the interstitial fluid (IF) is the fluid around body cells. Most of the time IF is exchanged with fluids in the blood vessels. During this exchange, IF glucose is enriched and cellular waste products are removed from the IF all over the body.
THE PROBLEM: When a person is in sound sleep and is mashing the CGM into the mattress, the IF is also mashed. It is this mashing or compressing of the IF that causes the IF not to exchange as it normally does. Since the cells around the CGM sensor wire continue to consume (eat) the glucose available in the compressed area around the sensor wire the glucose in the area drops.
OBSERVATION: It is this low reading in the CGM data is usually seen as a nearly level data graph and then a sudden drop of the glucose level. Because it is a low brought about by the pressure on the CGM, the term COMPRESSION LOW has been offered in pumping circles. Because the Compression Low is a low glucose only in the area of the CGM, a finger stick performed in response to a LOW alarm will show NORMAL. The variation between the finger stick and the CGM data leads to frustration and bewilderment, believing technology is the source of the error.
The next observation is the blood sugar measured by the CGM will return to a value near where the CGM line was before the drop in CGM value. The near level line, the drop & alarm, the finger stick of different reading, and the return to the near pre-alarm value is the full picture of the COMPRESSION LOW.
I would really like to get feedback. Thanks all.",Nov '20
1414,Compression Lows,Diabetes Technology,Tim12,2,"The scientific papers I’ve read mention “reduced glucose diffusion”, which I think matches your theory, but also indicate that compression effects on oxygen concentrations and other interstitial chemistry as well as temperature. Quoting https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3879750/ , “Susceptibility of Interstitial Continuous Glucose Monitor Performance to Sleeping Position”:

“What are the potential mechanisms of sensor inaccuracies during sleep? Laying on subcutaneous CGMs may cause pressure-induced or temperature-induced physiological fluctuations. Interstitial glucose sensors rely on adequate blood flow to the interstitial space for accurate measurement. Further, interstitial glucose sensors are sensitive to oxygen tension in the interstitial space; fluctuations in oxygen tension can affect the accuracy of the sensor.32 1 Finally,  in vivo  testing has also demonstrated that temperature has a profound impact on both subcutaneous oxygen tension and sensor output current.33,34 Pressure applied to tissue in the immediate vicinity of a sensor may decrease blood flow and oxygen tension and increase temperature, resulting in the CGM inaccuracies observed in the present study. Specifically, decreased blood flow to the capillaries immediately surrounding the sensing electrode is expected to depress CGM readings because of reduced glucose diffusion into the sensing area. Decreased oxygen availability in the tissue will also depress CGM readings due to the oxygen dependency of the enzymatic conversion of glucose via glucose oxidase. Warming of the area due to laying on the CGM will likely have the opposite effect and increase sensor signals. Clearly, CGM readings are influenced by multiple factors, including glucose and oxygen availability from the nearby vasculature, temperature, and other potential unidentified factors (e.g., temporary release of interfering substances during localized pressure or temperature, direct mechanical pressure on membrane elongation, or tension).”

I think that @Tim12‘s reference makes the important point that the compression reduces the blood flow locally … being more important than “squishing” the IF itself.
I have wondered whether one could make a BG measurement just adjacent to the sensor during a compression low and get a nice, real datapoint to test this theory. I rarely get a compression low, but maybe it would be interesting to intentionally induce a compression low to test this out.

They do a correlation between CGM’s on same and different sides, but I don’t think this is what you are suggesting.

Sensor excursions were strongly correlated with sleeping on the side of the sensor. For example when  not sleeping on the left side , left-sided sensor excursions occurred for 13.4% of time points (50 out of 372;  Table 1 , rows 1 and 3), whereas when  sleeping on the left side , left-sided sensor excursions occurred for 32.4% of time points (56 out of 173; Table 1, row 2). Using Fisher’s exact test on the contingency table, this correlation is significant ( p  < .001). Correspondingly, right-sided sensor excursions were much more common when sleeping on the right side [18 out of 143 (12.6%) time points] than when not sleeping on the right side [25 out of 402 (6.2%) time points;  p  < .001].

Thank you for posting that article and I have now read the whole thing … in addition to your extraction of key parts. Interesting indeed.
To answers your question, yes, I was suggesting taking a blood sample meter measurement adjacent to the sensor at the same time that one was experiencing a compression low. I actually wear my sensor on the back of one arm. While I’ve always done finger sticks, I know that a number of people use the inside of their forearm so was guessing that one could also draw a sample from either belly or upper arm depending on where the sensor was affixed.
I doubt that most lancets would penetrate the sensor adhesive fabric and, even it it did, the blood would like wick into the surrounding fabric instead of into the BG strip. As a result, if I try this experiment, I though I’d wait until a sensor session is about to end, then peel up the adhesive on one side of the patch, then compress the area and try to measure the near-sensor blood glucose at the same time that I’m seeing a compression low.
Of course, reading the paper that you posted is both easier and has better statistics …

Glycemic index (GI)  – a system of ranking foods containing equal amounts of carbohydrate according to how much they raise blood glucose levels. For instance, the carbohydrate in a slice of 100% stone-ground whole wheat bread (a low glycemic index food) may have less impact on blood glucose than a slice of processed white bread (a high glycemic index food). The GI is an additional meal-planning tool to help one understand how carbohydrate foods can differ in their effects on blood glucose (“Glycemic index” on TuDiabetes).

When I first was starting on the G4, I read about the possibility of breakage of the wire in the skin. I looked at the angle of insertion(about 45 degrees), and decided that pulling the sensor straight up off the skin could bend the wire fairly sharply at the skin surface, likely inviting a breakage. By lifting the adhesive carefully at the narrow end of the G6 transmitter, and lifting the adhesive pad on both sides, and finally at the wider end, holding a finger on the transmitter to keep it from lifting yet, the transmitter holder can then be lifted at the sides and pulled a little above a parallel to the skin surface and then moved away from the insertion point. The sensor wire has never broken for me in more than 4 years. Just be sure to pull the wire straight out of the tiny hole, rather than bend it around a corner.
The G6 wires are finer that the G4 wires, so they can likely break more easily.

 Looking_for_Answers:

What are the pros and cons of the pumps you have used? Which pump did you like better?


That’s a great question, but kind of a deep rabbit hole to start down as everyone weighs in, and personal preferences factor in to a huge extent. When you’re attached to a medical device that’s doing deep metabolic adjustments inside your body 24/7/365, things that seem like very small inconveniences to begin with can get to be major annoyances over time. So this topic is almost guaranteed to end up with people saying they could never live with PumpA because of X, and others weighing in to say they love PumpA in spite of X, or X never happens with their pump what are you talking about, or X is just not a big a deal to them and they couldn’t use PumpB because of Y, etc etc.
But the big things to consider are


Tube vs tube-free. If tubing is gonna drive you nuts, then your only choice is Ominpod, which has a pretty big fan base. A lot of us find tubing turns out not to be as big a PITA as it seemed like it was gonna be so other things matter more.

Tubed pumps: Medtronic vs everything else. These days “everything else” mostly means Tandem. Both now have CGM integration with hybrid-closed-loop control, meaning your pump responds to data from your CGM to dynamically control basal insulin delivery in real time. But there are big differences in their tech and CGM integration

Closed loop features and CGM integration. This is the big crux because they’re all doing the loop thing now, or developing it (Omnipod), and if you’re used to a Dexcom CGM that’s going to be a big checkmark against Medtronic which requires you to use their proprietary Guardian3 system. Which is frankly not nearly as good as the Dexcom (I know, I’ve used both). Tandem and Omnipod both integrate with Dexcom, but Omnipod’s looping capability is still in development.

Remote software update. Currently Tandem is alone in providing this capability, which is a hugely significant and long overdue development. We are stuck with replacing these things only every 4 years, yet the pace of improvements in interface design and looping tech is running vastly faster than that. Imagine if you could only update your phone’s operating system every 4 years at the cost of replacing the whole phone. Tandem’s Basal IQ the first rollout of this system. People who bought a Tandem before Basal IQ became available can upgrade their firmware online and voila. When Medtronic rolls out its upgrade to the 670G, which was a failure for me, It won’t do me any good until my insurance lets me trade in my pump for a new one a couple of years hence.

The upshot of all this for me is that I’m using a Medtronic pump with an unintegrated Dexcom CGM. If I were buying a pump now I’d almost certainly be leaning toward Tandem, largely due to the Dexcom integration and remote update capability. Those features alone would likely outweigh some of the other bits and quibbles I’ve picked up from other users along the way, mainly having to do with the insulin reservoir loading process and how the delivery mechanism works. It also looks like the control software is more flexible than the rigid Medtronic looping system, which I found very frustrating.",Feb '20

Craig, I’m on day 3 with Apidra and I think I’m seeing some trends similar to what you and sri describe - a faster peak and shorter duration, but I haven’t crunched the numbers yet so I can’t really be sure. If so, that works great for use in a pump (not necessarily for MDIs though!).
sri, you make are really interesting point about immunity - I will have to pay close attention to the first couple days after the switch. Maybe it would be better to do two weeks on each one instead of one…
Hannah, I heard the same thing about Apidra being less viscous. I never really got a lot of no delivery alarms on Humalog, but it will be interesting to see if the absorption is any different!

My own experience was that Humalog was the fastest to work and had the shortest duration of activity.

Apidra falls somewhere in between; it was not as fast as Humalog, but much faster than Novolog. However, my own feeling is that rapid-acting analogs are more hyped than in reality; no fewer than 5 meta-analyses have proven conclusively that the clinical trials on analogs were of methodologically poor quality, did not show meaningful differences in hemoglobin A1c.

I just got some Apidra samples and used them for two meals today. I’d been seeing some highs with Novolog recently–I opened a new pen and was still seeing highs, but possibly my pens were getting old since I bought them in October.
Whatever the case, the first two trials the Apidra worked extremely quickly and it gave me even better numbers than Novolog has been. I didn’t go high at all and was back to baseline by 2 hours and dropped a bit more in the third hour. Nothing after that. Also my blood sugar started to drop at 15 minutes and I think that the claim you could inject after eating might hold up.
The only downside is the Opticlick pen. My mate took one look at it and asked me if it was an extra large vibrator. I don’t think it will fit comfortably in my purse, either. Your point in an old blog entry about what happens if you lose the pen is a real concern, ditto what happens if you want to check that the cartridge hadn’t gone bad by using a new one.

I really don’t have a whole lot of free time and with the long discussion about the differences between humalog and novolog I thought it would be interesting to post something. Hopefully I didn’t make any errors and it came out interesting.
There is a controversy right now among individuals about the differences between the two types of rapid acting insulin Humalog (Insulin Lispro) and Novolog (Insulin Apart). People claim they are the same, they are different and one works better than the other. This post will focus on the structure of the human insulin compared to each analog, and molecular mechanisms of each type, how they are formulated and how each should work. I’m not saying one is better than the other. The actions of each are specific to each person and the choice of insulin should always be a discussion between you and your physician. I have my personal preference and that’s exactly it, my personal preference for how I control my disease.
The first thing is to distinguish between the different types of insulin. This post will focus specifically on 2 of the rapid acting insulins, Humalog and Novolog. I am working on another blog post about how long acting insulins work. While they are different, they can be used interchangably. Pharmacies will readily substitute one for the other if they are out and the patient does not have a strong preference. This has been my experience, yours may/will differ.
So how are Novolog and Humalog different from regular human insulin?
This is a very important topic and will take up the majority of this post because this will explain why one may work better than others.

Very, very, very scary event!!!
As you are always the first to jump in to try to help others facing challenging situations, in that same spirit, I’d like to offer a list of suggestions that may help you unravel this odd and dangerous pattern. Some of these suggestions may seem silly or you may be well further along than this in figuring out what is going on. I apologize in advance if any of these suggestions annoy you … but they are offered  in the hope that they may be of help to you.
For starters, do you have, or can you get, any of the newer shelf stable glucagon?  On two occasions a number of years ago when I had a “scary low”, I was able to self-administer the old dry-mix glucagon. I realize that may not always be possible, but it is a useful option in those situations when juice doesn’t seem to work.
Have you carefully checked ALL of your pump settings to make sure that you don’t have an error or typo?  While I don’t know anything about an OmniPod, it seems as if it is easy to enter an incorrect number for basal rate or carb ratio and yet not trivial to see or find that error.
Have you gone through all of your pump and Dexcom logs and reviewed what you ate for the past 24 hours to see if you have any hidden clues?  I know that I am prone to errors … particularly when I am trending low. For example, for a pre-meal bolus I’ve entered 85 grams of carbs instead of 55 … and not noticed it until many hours later after trying to unravel a crashing low. I have also entered a finger stick BG level in the grams of carb field which is almost always a bad move.
I certainly don’t want to insult you by suggesting that you look for errors, but on more than one occasion I have learned the hard way that I, at least, am perfectly capable of making jaw-dropping errors. While it is certainly likely that you may be experiencing a physiological shift on basal needs, I also think that it is worthwhile to check for possible errors or other explanations.
I sincerely hope that you are having an uneventful night tonight …
Please stay safe!

 John_S2:

do you have, or can you get, any of the newer shelf stable glucagon?


No, I don’t. I haven’t owned glucagon in years. You self-administered, huh? Its possible that I could self administer. Shel stable certainly sounds better than refrigerated because I could keep in next to me.



 John_S2:

you don’t have an error or typo?


I was looking for errors last night. Unfortunately, I was doing it with a BG = 40. So, I will need to double check today. While I don’t expect to find any errors, I do believe that there has been a dramatic shift in my settings because there was a dramatic shift up into wildly high insulin requirements some months ago. I think I am on the downside of that and need to work quickly to drop the dosages.



 John_S2:

Have you gone through all of your pump and Dexcom logs


I’m uploading the Omnipod data into Tidepool now to take a closer look. I am suspicious about user error because I have been alternating between a low dose
basal setting during the night and a high dose basal setting during the day. I might have left the high dose running overnight, or accidentally selected it when my BG was low.

We had someone post on the site about an experience like that.
I’ve read academic papers about murder with insulin and I wrote a paper for my computer forensics class on if you can do forensic analysis of diabetes devices (because my professor was a cop at the St Paul crime lab). He didn’t like my paper, but I think that it was pretty original and asked some practical questions about forensic analysis of medical devices.
They have caught people delivering fatal insulin dosages through the pump. It was sparked by nurse comments that just sorta stuck in my head over the years - offhand (maybe joking comments) that insulin would be the best way to kill someone because it would be virtually undetectable.

After complete vaccination, I would still be wearing a mask and washing hands frequently, since these have positive knock-on effects for ourselves as well as for the unvaccinated. I could then starting walking more, if not to and from work, then longer hikes on weekends and visiting museums. Dining out would come back for us, as would having friends over, and all of those are very health-conscious, as well as careful about the virus, assuming they get vaccinated. I could also then get back to the gym, which pre-pandemic was about 4 to 5 times per week.

Cultural events, in packed halls, would come back later, as would travel requiring flight, although local vacations would pick up.
Forward change wouldn’t be much to implement, but then we need to unwind some practices. The rowing machine I bought for the lockdown would need to be sold. The extra supplies we keep and replenish would need to be wound down. Aspects of extra cleanliness, which aren’t normally helpful, like wiping down deliveries, would simply end.

Health checks and treatments for not fatal effects would increase. There will be pushes to compensate for the education loss suffered by many, if not most, children.

1560,Transition back to real life,Type 1 and LADA,mohe0001,1,"It’s been my experience that whenever there is (even sometimes subtle) lifestyle change, there is risk of surprise attacks from D. Does that make sense?
I’m superstitious about doing new things.
Examples:
1.) When I first flew overseas.

The change in sleep patterns provoked seizures.
Failing to reset the clock on my insulin pump sent the basal patterns into disarray.
The amount of walking/changes in eating that you do in foreign countries was something I needed to learn how to adapt to. The 1st time I was in CN, I only ate white rice and that created stability until I had time to learn. The 2nd time, I was able to eat a variety of things.

2.) The 1st time I skied UP a ski hill

I totally didn’t anticipate what that would do to me. Something like 12 hours later, I was so exhausted and getting such rapid lows that it took me down. But, the 2nd time and every time after that I was prepared for how hard that level of intense exercise hits and ‘how’ it manifests.

Maybe you all are saying that I shouldn’t be so concerned. Maybe your right. But, I have never emerged after a pandemic before and my lifestyle changes have been dramatic during this time. I would like to have some risk mitigation strategies in place. But, I don’t know what to anticipate. I will need to reset my relationship with eating, and my body/activity level, and my brain.
I think that a switch will flip and I will just pour out into the streets in 2 - 3 months. It will be like the end of WW2 and there will be such celebration as I have never seen. I think that I will need to be cautious and keep a close eye on how my body is experiences that event.
The shift out of lockdown will be inherently more risky than the shift into lockdown, for me. There will be an explosion in activity level. I will lose weight. The experience will have physical presentation. It will be a physical experience. The people in these photos from WW2 are at a physical event, not just a psychological one. Events like these are highly physical in nature. They require stamina. When you work with huge crowds in events like these, there is often a huge outpouring of medical emergencies.
Do my thoughts make sense? Like, Springtime is a physical event in Minnesota. But, this is gonna be different.

Eat better, better carbs
Less walking, amounting to hours per week
Less intense workouts that are slightly shorter
Fewer meals out

The overall effect of the changes has been to increase my need for short-term insulin, primarily because of less evening activity, the walk to and from the gym, combined with fewer longer, intense workouts, and with that extra time at home the calorie balance that has shifted to the early evening. Not bad food, but a bit more than usual, since the intense workouts tend to reduce appetite, so after a trek over to the gym, the workout, and coming back, I wouldn’t be nearly as hungry, nor have as much time to eat.

I worry that a bunch of us will have heart attacks if we just flip a switch. I feel a little uncertain about what level of cardiovascular injury might have resulted from lockdown of this length.


I don’t know about others. But with me working from home 98%+ of the time, I get out and about outdoors every single day, walking 10,000-20,000 steps every single day. I hardly ever hit that goal my heart doctor gave me, before the lockdown began in March. Since mid-March I’ve been able to hit the 10,000 step goal almost every single day.
My TIR on my CGM went from mid-80% to close to 90%. Again closely related to me being able to do exercise at times that most help with rapid insulin absorption.

My understanding is that all vaccines — including, for example, vaccines for polio, flu, measles, pneumonia, shingles — have a risk of triggering severe allergic reactions. I get vaccinated for the flu every year and I always get what I assume is the same warning leaflet warning about allergies.
I would not be surprised if eventually some small fraction of people receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine also have an allergic reaction.
In the case of the very few (less than 10?) allergic reactions so far, this included people who were carrying their epi pens with them.

1636,Intro,Community,The_Burn,4,"Hi. At 56, I’ve been T2 for almost exactly 9 years - was a decently-controlled pre-diabetic that accidentally/mistakenly had steroids included with my chemo infusions for a week or so.  Almost overnight, my BG went from 125 to 396.  Unlike with prednisone, when I got off the steroid, my BG never came back down to a pre-diabetic level. I’ve been insulin-dependent ever since. Because I have an ileostomy due to the cancer, I’m unable to tolerate high fiber foods, making it more difficult to eat the way the CDEs & RDs would prefer (and I’ve tried several dietitians/nutritionists who said they understood the juxtaposition, but usually just told me to count carbs & calories, without suggestions for what to replace them with).
Sometimes I’ve been a “good” diabetic and gotten my A1C down in the mid 6s (usually with an Atkins-like diet) and other times, I’ve been frustrated, said screw it and let it get in the 12s. I could blame it on hating fingerpricks or a bad memory, but really I just preferred to enjoy food because life’s too short already.
I started using the 10-day Freestyle Libre almost a year ago and find it a godsend and, particularly, after the change to 14-day with a 1-hour startup.

1640,Intro,Community,TapestryType 1 or LADA,2,"Hello and welcome to TuDiabetes, Russell @The_Burn,
I’ve been using an OmniPod for several years now.  My basal rates are between 0.05 and 0.09 units per hour.  My insulin to carb ratio ranges between 1:6 to 1:30 depending upon the time of day.  My max bolus with the OmniPod is 8 units but I rarely went over a 5 unit bolus (my typical bolus was 2 to 3 units).  My total daily dose (basal and bolus) via the OmniPod was in the 25-35 unit range.
Then life happened.  I started to have highs I could not control, no matter how much I bolused or increased my basal.
I stumbled on something called “tunneling” with OmniPods.  Turns out I was having absorption issues and the insulin was coming back out of the pod (the tunneling problem).  I didn’t realize it for a very long time.  Once I did, I changed a few things.  1) I changed pod placement from my belly to other areas of my body.  2) I only use the OmniPod for basal and I inject all boluses (meal and correction) with a syringe and vial of insulin.  These steps have worked like a charm.
I’ve heard from others in the DOC (Diabetes Online Community) that OmniPod is best delivered in small doses; anything over 4ish units and it begins to tunnel (backup).  I’m mentioning this because I’m sensing your insulin needs may cause similar problems for you and I thought it would help if you were aware of them.
Other podders may have different experiences and work-arounds and hopefully they will come around an chime in!

Get a Dexcom if you can. One thing good about the Dexcom. The alerts, at first they were annoying. Then I decided to use them to my advantage, not just as alerts at being too high or too low already.  But I used the alerts as a warning that I am approaching numbers I don’t want to be at. Although I guess the miao miao right now can be used to turn the Libre into a CGM with alerts.
I prebolus plus I will not even eat my meal unless I am under 110. maybe I will cave on that if under 120 with a graph arrow saying I am dropping. But maybe try when you are sitting at 200 giving yourself an adjustment and wait to eat until you have dropped to a much lower number? As you know with kidney disease you really need
some lower numbers.
What’s great about an Omnipod (any pump) is the ability to adjust the basal rate as you actually need it. Plus the ability to give small adjustments constantly as you need it. That combined with a CGM can really help with control of BG numbers. Look at your CGM see you are a little high, push a button for an adjustment. It’s great.
@Tapestry has some really good points about high doses on the Omnipod. A lot of people have complained about higher dosing on an Omnipod, Plus sometimes you get site failures with any pump and your numbers will go up. It might be best if you are taking bigger doses to do your bolus for meals still in a shot and save your pump for smaller adjustments and basal rate.
The other thing you will run into is the pod only holds 200 units of insulin by volume. So you will get close to using that up in 3 days by basal rate alone. Your needs  of basal usually go down with a pump so you also should have a little more wiggle room for small adjustments in small bolus amounts, You could consider using the double Humalog concentrate , the 200 instead, then the pod will last longer with more actual insulin in it. Trickier to program, but once you understand it, it’s not hard. I use the Humalog 200 in my Omnipod.

The CKD is what prompted this re-evaluation and the decision to pump. It literally came out of nowhere at the beginning of the year and we’ve been modifying variables to verify that it was true.

1649,Intro,Community,DevRose,,Hi.  I’m Devin. I’m new to diabetes and don’t really know what type I am. I’m 41 and I was diagnosed in dka in September with a bg of 473 and an a1c of 12.1. I tested  negative for gad antibodies but my cpeptide was low. My diagnosis says t1d and my first appointment they said t1d but my appointment the other day they said type 2 but i don’t make insulin anymore.  Either way I’m fairly confused by that but im not sure it really matters. I was told in 2019 i may be prediabetic and needed to lose weight (im 5’11 and i weighed 209). That was the first er visit in 2 weeks.  They thought i may be having a heart attack.  2 weeks later i was back for a panic attack.  12 hours after that i was back vomiting blood and diagnosed with  gallstones. 24 hours later i was back with acute cholysystitis and obstruction and had to have surgery. Within a year and half of the surgery i lost 50 pounds. I also started having issues with dizziness and nausea if i didn’t eat.  In August i started to feel thirsty often.  It got worse and worse and my hair started to fall out and i lost 10 pounds in a few days. After about a week and a half of barely being able to get out of bed and almost passing out i went to the er and was in dka. And now here I am.,Nov '20
1650,Intro,Community,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,,"There are a few type 1’s that don’t test positive for antibodies, they don’t know why. My DE is one of those, she makes no insulin but doesn’t have the antibodies.
Don’t let them label you a type 2. Type 1 if you test positive for the antibodies that’s a definitive yes. But if you have low c peptide that is also a yes. A type 1 especially a LADA/type 1 slowly loses the ability to make insulin and their c-peptide will be low normal or low and that can vary some as you lose the ability over time to make insulin. Eventually it lands at zero or close to zero. But your pancreas will keep trying sometimes up to 8 years plus. But a type 2 will test high or high normal because they have a different issue, they are insulin resistant, so they make enough insulin and usually more than normal as their body tries to make up for it.
If you are low on the c peptide, you do not fit a type 2. Unfortunately too many doctors still misdiagnose type 1. I still hear about it. The knowledge is really lacking sometimes in GP’s.
DKA is generally a type 1 issue unless you are on certain diabetic medications. DKA isn’t caused by high blood sugars, it is caused by lack of insulin.
It does matter what you are labeled for most people. Insurance and proper treatment. If you are labeled a type 1 it is easier to get tools we use okayed by insurance. Plus they are more likely to set up the proper treatment needed, insulin, which is critical, pumps, cgm’s which can be helpful etc.
Hopefully someone just glanced at the chart and saw no antibodies and said type 2. Hopefully they did not change the original diagnosis. Sometimes a nurse or doctor or something will not really read the chart???
But you also should get a copy of the results and see what tests they ran. They commonly just test for the one most common antibody test which is Gad, but there are a few other antibody tests. But there are several type 1 types of diabetes that just don’t fit the common molds. There is also one that is caused by steroid use or panceas trauma, sometimes in those cases insulin production can return.

Today is 12/22/2020 and my 10-day sensor will expire on 12/25/2020 at which time will be the 100+ day end of life for my transmitter as well.
I decided with only 3 days to go before I need to put in both a new G6 sensor and a new transmitter that I would experiment wearing them during my CT scan and see if the Siemens dual source scanner, bombarding my sensor and transmitter with x-rays in any way disrupts, destroys or distorts the signal or information sent to my Dexcom receiver. I normally have also asked for the receiver to be taken out of the room and kept in the control room during this procedure. This time I kept the receiver in the room, next to, although not inside the scanner.
The CT Scan had absolutely no effect on either my sensor, transmitter or receiver. BG readings did not even skip 1 dot and stayed normal flatline during the procedure. So, from now on I always plan to just leave my CGM in place and not mess with it in any way when having a CT Scan.
CT scans are becoming increasingly ubiquitous so it would be nice to see others that have had experiences with their CGM and computed tomography to chime in.
Please note if you attempt to do this you are not abiding by Dexcom’s written procedures so you do so at your own risk. Dexcom statement is as follows:
Contraindication
No MRI/CT/Diathermy – MR Unsafe
Don’t wear your CGM (sensor, transmitter, receiver, or smart device) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment.
The G6 hasn’t been tested in those situations. The magnetic fields and heat could damage the components of the G6, which may cause it to display inaccurate G6 sensor glucose readings (G6 readings) or may prevent alerts. Without G6 readings or alarm/alert notifications, you might miss a severe low or high glucose event.

Nope. I just feel my bladder is full and need to pee. I do feel lower back pain but the pain has been there for 2-3 weeks now, and the frequent urination only happened yesterday night.
I might just mention in case anyone has this problem and know how to fix it -  everyday when i wake up, my lower back is really sore.  I go to bed okay.  It’s just when I wake up.  Once I get up and start moving, the pain is gone, but the first thing I notice when I am awake is my lower back is in a lot of pain - it feels like its muscle pain more than mechanical (ie doesn’t feel like a joint is out of place).  I try to stretch it out at night before bed, sometimes it helps and sometimes doesn’t.  My core strength isn’t the best (and probably this is what is causing it) and I have tried some strengthening exercises too.
This pain comes and goes, but when it’s here it lingers for a while.  Sometimes I have it for a month or so and then it dissapears but eventually it will come back.  I’ve been battling this for a while but haven’t been able to find the cause of it.   I was worried it was my kidneys and got a urine test done and my GP says its fine and he says the place where is is sore is not where the kidney is.  I also noticed the intensity is more when i wake up sleeping on my back compared to if i was sleeping on my side.



 MM1:

Have you considered a UTI?


I don’t have any of the symptoms listed.  When i have UTI, i feel I need to pee but can’t and that feeling makes me feel really bad.   But this is different, its just like my bladder is full and I need to go like normally.  It doesn’t burn or feel weird.  I just feel a bit tired after like the 5th time.  It doesn’t lasts.  Might happen for 1-5 nights usually less and then disappears maybe like once every two months.

Avoid hesitating.  Easy for me to say and do because I’ve been doing injections on myself for 50 years and I’m a Nurse Anesthetist so I poke people all the time with big pointy things.

Those discussions provided me with the insight and ability to adopt carb limits in response to an adverse diabetes complication in 2012.
I live with T1D and even though our numbers are increasing, the chance of someone with T1D interacting with someone else in a sustained community-like way in real life is fairly rare. For me, TuDiabetes changed that.
I’m not much of a joiner in my life but this virtual community has materially changed my diabetes life towards a much better trajectory. In addition to launching me into the sustained (8 years now) habit of using food to positively affect my health, it also introduced me through a mentor I met here to the world of do-it-yourself open source diabetes tech that significantly improved not only my physical health but my emotional well-being.

If the sensor wire only went in half way or if it got bent you will have similar issues.

Thing is, BT itself isn’t the must ironclad reliable thing in the known universe. Dx tech FAQ only talks about things like concrete and steel barriers causing problems between your sensor and receiver, but the radio airwaves are getting more crowded all the time and there can be other devices—including plain old WiFi networks—that are operating on the same frequency as Bt and can interfere with it. I believe the signal strength of the G6 is actually improved over the G5 (I had lots more dropouts with the G5 than I do now), but even so it’s bound to be relatively weak compared with, say, your household WiFi network, simply b/c you can only pack so much power into such a miniaturized device whose battery is certified to last for 3 months.
If you have an Android phone you have access to more granular BT settings than iPhones expose. If you do some googling you can find articles about that having to do with tweaking the BT protocol filtering. But with the rate of dropout you’re experiencing and the fact that it has only recently started to appear, I expect some new interference source has recently appeared in your vicinity. If you’ve recently acquired a new WiFi router, that would be one thing to check. Some routers allow you to select different frequency channels.

Yes, sure sounds that way. Not sure exactly what the nomenclature is but it’s possible some bad data has built up in the phone and the BT cache needs to be cleared.

Do you have a back-up plan for pump failures? Any basal insulin on hand? If you do, I think that would be preferable to charging a pump that has already complained with high heat.

1749,G6 app bug blocks alerts,Diabetes Technology,Edward_Reid,,"I’m interested in whether others have encountered this bug in the G6 Android app, which has almost bitten me several times, and possibly bit me bad once.
I’ve observed it a number times in the previous version of the app. I’ve seen enough to know that it also appears in the recent update (v1.8). I’ve pretty sure it also occurs in the receiver. I have no way to check the iOS app.
Report it? I did report it to Dexcom, but customer support is a brick wall trained never to bother software development. I’ve told my endo, who was surprised.
OK, I’m not intentionally being coy, just wanting to set things up right.
Problem: if a fast fall alert is ignored three times (or maybe it’s four), then that alert stops sounding, and more critically, blocks a low alert.
Lots of qualifications there. But “blocks a low alert” should get everyone’s attention.
Start with the fast fall alert. Probably all Dexcom users quickly learn that it doesn’t much matter whether you acknowledge the alert. Unlike with a low alert, if the fast fall condition still exists five minutes later, it will sound again right then. So shy bother? Whether it sounds again in five minutes depends not on your action but solely on whether the condition continues to exist.
But there is a difference after it sounds three (or perhaps four) times without acknowledgement. At that point it blocks. You can see one result in this screenshot of my lock screen: The alert is for a fast fall at 171, but the current reading is already down to 139:
1080×2220 171 KB
This is actually 15+ minutes after the alert – I also have screen shots where the current value was 160 and 150. Normally the alert would be updating the bg value every 5 minutes. And though the screen shot does not include sound effects, I know that the fast fall alert had been sounding until my bg reached 171, and not afterward.
Eventually the alert will sound again if the fast fall continues to exist. I’ve seen it happen but have not ascertained how long it takes. Fifteen minutes would be consistent with other parts of the app.
Now, that’s bad enough. In an extreme situation, the app could be giving you fast fall alerts at 170 and go silent until you reach (say) 100, still in fast fall.
But even scarier, that locked fast fall alert doesn’t just block subsequent fast fall alerts. It also blocks the low bg alert! So – with my settings of 2 for fast fall and 90 for low alert – I could have a readings sequence of 130 (start), 119 (FF alert), 108 (FF alert), 97 (FF alert), 86 (low and fast fall but NO ALERT), 75 (ditto). I’m down to 75 in fast fall and the app is silent.
I do not know whether an urgent low ALARM could also be blocked. I really don’t want to do the experiment necessary to determine.
I assume all the above stuff also happens in reverse with fast rise and high bg alerts. Those don’t happen to me as often and I pay them less attention, so I haven’t documented them. (As they say, low bg is dangerous on a time scale of minutes but high bg is dangerous on a time scale of years.)
This MAY have contributed to a nasty episode on August 26, 2018.After eating a large mango, my bg was 350, so I took 2 units of Humalog – no more because I was leaving on a bike ride. At the time I was using the G5 receiver, After a few minutes it started buzzing fast fall, but this was OK because I was so high. About 40 minutes later, the last thing I remember is pulling off the road into a sidewalk. A few minutes later a passerby called 911, and I woke up looking at an EMT. While my analysis pointed at a perfect storm of about half a dozen causes, I was not then aware of this possible additional cause: if the fast fall and low alerts were blocked, I may have continued riding when I should have stopped and guzzled the glucose syrup that was in my pocket.
This of course depends on the receiver having the same bug as the Android app. I keep trying to turn on the receiver when a fast fall is expected, but I have not managed to turn on the receiver at the right moment. But otherwise they seem to work identically except for parts of the UI and capabilities the receiver simply lacks.",7d
1750,G6 app bug blocks alerts,Diabetes Technology,Firenza,,"I don’t personally use the fast fall alert. Just the urgent low soon, low and urgent low alerts. In my experience if the app has already told you that you are either going to be low soon or are falling the low alert will not sound but the urgent low will still work.
I had a pretty bad low once from this quirk where I was woken up by the urgent low soon alert, I treated it with glucose and went back to sleep but I remained low for a considerable amount of time without getting any more alerts until by BG was 55 and dropping. I too called Dexcom about this but didn’t get a satisfactory explanation either. All I was able to determine is that it wasn’t considered a glitch. It is built in to the software that way, although lord knows why.",7d
1751,G6 app bug blocks alerts,Diabetes Technology,mohe0001,,"I haven’t noticed the issue that you mention. But, I will keep an eye out for it.
My ‘fast fall’ alarm (via the app) is set to a police siren, so I tend to stop what I’m doing and acknowledge it. Except when I’m out walking the dog near the police station. I have, several times, assumed that it was an actual police siren sounding in the distance and didn’t recognize it was a Dexcom alarm. In that case, it did sound a multitude of times. That’s how I eventually realized it was a Dexcom alert.
I’ve been having a bunch of highs, so I think I could easily run some tests.
Do we have any well thought through test conditions for this event that would help clarify things?",6d
1752,G6 app bug blocks alerts,Diabetes Technology,Edward_Reid,,"Test conditions: the problem for me is that the test conditions are situations I try to avoid.  Fast change, especially when nearing a limit.
I suppose I see it most often when my bg has been high and I finally get it dropping. If it’s well over 200 when I first get the fast fall, I can let it sound several times before I take action. That was the case in the image I posted.
Letting it fast-fall down to my low alert setting is scarier. And of course I can’t predict exactly when it will get there. Sometimes I’m trying to catch it happening, but then either the locked alert times out first, or it stops dropping so fast, and I don’t get an observation.
A fast rise of course is less scary, but in that case I’m likely to be trying to treat even more quickly – I can stop a fast fall pretty reliably with a big gulp of glucose syrup, but a fast rise can take longer to deal with, depending on what caused it. (One thing I find interesting about CGM is seeing the result of taking glucose – a fast rise that suddenly peaks and stops.)
I suppose what would help clarify the most would be if I stopped and made notes when I started getting a fast change alert. The reason I’m not certain how many alerts are needed to block is that I forget how many I’ve ignored. 
That’s funny about the police siren. I tried a lot of sounds and returned to the defaults – at least they are the defaults IIRC – because a scale (up or down) for fast change and an arpeggio (up or down) for breaching the limit has an easy-to-remember symmetry for me. I save the siren for urgent low – it seems to be able to awaken me even when I’ve slept through the milder alerts. ",6d
1753,G6 app bug blocks alerts,Diabetes Technology,Edward_Reid,1,"Oh, I didn’t mention, I have the fast-fall alert set for 2 points/minute. Obviously that makes it more likely that I’ll see that alert, compared with 3/min.
Just a few minutes ago, I got this sequence:
168 (alert sounded, did not clear)
153 (alert sounded, did not clear)
143 (alert sounded, did not clear)
136 (alert still showing but did not sound, did not clear)
129 (alert gone)
I did nothing to stop the fall until after the 129. IOW, I cannot plan on any event continuing. But the situation at 136 demonstrates the problem; it should have sounded again. (For those who don’t use the fast-change alerts, they appear to be based on an average of the past three intervals. Thus the drop from 143 to 136 is still in fast-fall because of the previous two intervals. I’ve seen cases where the last change is a rise – have taken glucose – yet I get one more fast-fall alert.)
Oh, why a fast fall? Took lunch insulin, but then that persimmon looked so good I had to eat it right away. Ah … almost like pure sugar. Quick rise, then quick fall.",6d
1754,G6 app bug blocks alerts,Diabetes Technology,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,,"I don’t use the fast fall alert either. I do know it’s a toss up for me to set the urgent low soon every 15 minutes or 30 minutes.  I hate the every 15 minutes because it’s like Pavlov’s dogs, you are tuned that you have to eat something when it goes off. I don’t like that signaling to my brain when whatever I took doesn’t have time enough to really hit completely. So I prefer the every 30 minutes.
I too got hit hard once, when I consumed something thinking I would be okay, but I never went above my low alert and kept dropping until the reaching 55 soon came on.  I started dropping from a miscalculation of exercise effects, so it hit pretty hard. I wish they had a handy “snooze” button. You could “snooze” it to alert you again if wanted. That way you could have it alert you again if you are low in 15 minutes etc under certain circumstances.",6d
1755,G6 app bug blocks alerts,Diabetes Technology,Terry4,,"I don’t have anything to add to what others have already commented. I wonder if you’ve considered attempting to manage the underlying cause that makes you vulnerable to missed fast fall or rise alarms.
It appears to me, and I may be mistaken, that the real source of your problem is excessive swings of blood glucose. Is this happening every day or several times per week? Perhaps this only occurs once per month. Please forgive me if this does not apply in your case.
Since you use the Dexcom G6, the standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation % (CV) measures provide information about your glucose variability. High glucose variability has been demonstrated to go hand in hand with an increase in hypoglycemia.
I don’t discount your observation that the G6 is letting you down in its failure to warn you about rise and fall rate alarms. But I wonder if your efforts may be better rewarded by asking yourself about the root causes of the need for these alarms.",6d

I’m not really trying to address handling the effect on me. I’m trying to create publicity that might persuade Dexcom to fix an obvious bug. Reporting it directly by an individual seems to be about as effective as a similar effort related to the federal government.

I am still using the Blood Glucose (BG) meter which came with my 630G, an Ascensia (formerly Bayer) Contour Next Link 2.4.
I looked at the Tandem t:connect Add a Blood Glucose Meter site only to find that none of the Contour Next BG meters are supported. So there doesn’t seem to be any way for me to upload my BG meter’s data into Tandem t:connect.
Worse, I can’t seem to find a non-intrusive way to add a BG meter result by entering it on my pump. The only way I’ve found so far is to enter the meter BG as a CGM calibration. This seems to get the BG result saved, but I’d prefer also being able to add a BG result without calibrating the CGM. I could do this with the 630G by entering a BG as a correction bolus of 0 units.

In order to add your BG on your t:slim X2 pump, without delivering a bolus, please follow these steps:

From the Home screen tap BOLUS.
Tap Add BG.
Using the on-screen keypad, enter your BG value and tap [check mark]. Once [check mark] is tapped, the BG value is saved in your pump history whether or not a bolus is delivered.
Follow the steps in the appropriate Target section above depending on the results of your BG value.

Keep in mind you can have very similar reactions to gluten and grains without having celiac as well. I have  had reactions to corn and wheat/ gluten / grains for years but was never told to stop gluten and grains. In fact grains are pushed on you by a lot of hcw.
I remember my doctor telling me to try Metamucil for my irritable bowel syndrome years ago, (which is not a real diagnosis). It gave me severe diarrhea within a few minutes, I never used it again after that.
The theory with gluten and grains and autoimmunity is they weaken the gastro lining, leaky gut etc. which results in an attack on the offending particles and eventually the body.
Whether it happens as a result of leaky gut or not I don’t know but I do believe now all those years of IBS caused by reactions to gluten and grains did play a role for me.

1796,Mail order pharmacy is booming – here’s what to look out for,Treatment,MilaStaff,,"WRITTEN BY: JULIA FLAHERTY
Editor’s Note: People who take insulin require consistently affordable and predictable sources of insulin at all times. If you or a loved one are struggling to afford or access insulin, click here.
COVID-19 has prompted many people with chronic illness to consider getting prescription drugs delivered through mail order pharmacies so they don’t have to deal with the risk of in-pharmacy visits. While a variety of options had already been available, the addition of Amazon’s mail order pharmacy in November broadened the options for people looking at mail order as a possibility.
Particularly for anyone reliant on insulin, receiving medication through the mail can come with risks, and the cost-savings often touted by mail order pharmacies may not always apply. Below, we explore how Amazon’s launch may impact the industry, as well as the overall impacts on cost, access, affordability, and convenience that mail order pharmacies can offer.
AMAZON’S DIGITAL PHARMACY
This November, Amazon made a big move into healthcare by launching an online pharmacy. Prime members are eligible to cover their prescription medications with their health insurance, paying a typical copay. If Prime members don’t have health insurance or don’t want to pay for their prescription medication using health insurance, they have access to generic and brand-name medications, some of which are discounted from typical list price.
This Amazon launch comes two years after it acquired PillPack, an online pharmacy known for putting the customer’s prescriptions into one complete packet and delivering it on a monthly basis. By launching its own digital pharmacy in 2020, Amazon has sent shockwaves through the healthcare sector, taking direct aim at its largest competitors, CVS Health and Walgreens, according to Bloomberg. Amazon also aims to compete with Walmart’s pharmacy.
While this launch has undoubtedly caused a stir in the mail order pharmacy market, it begs a bigger question for consumers: “What will the future of mail order pharmacies be?” And, for the diabetes community, “Will mail order pharmacy services offer better savings and convenience for managing my type 1 diabetes?”
IMPACTS ON COST
Depending on the consumer’s health insurance plan, a mail order pharmacy may save time and money. But without insurance, the consumer is unlikely to benefit. Often, through insurance, consumers are given discounts by ordering a 90-day supply (versus 30-day supply) through their health insurance’s own or contracted mail order pharmacy. Whereas, at a local in-person pharmacy, it may cost the consumer more to get the same refill for this select number of days.
The best way to determine if it will save you money by ordering from your local pharmacy versus ordering through your insurance’s mail order pharmacy is by calling both pharmacies to run a cost estimate before you fulfill your prescriptions. Or, if you have the option, you are often able to run a cost-savings analysis through your insurance website, usually found under “Pharmacy Benefits.”
Mail order pharmacies may make it more difficult to submit coupons through manufacturer programs or from GoodRX discounts, among others. Whereas, speaking to a local pharmacy rep may make the process easier and ensure you get the best prices on your medications. Combining coupon programs with insurance can be tricky, often leaving the consumer to weigh which option may provide a larger discount or benefit.
IMPACTS ON AFFORDABILITY
While mail order pharmacies do offer discounts to consumers through various coupon or 90-day ordering programs, many of these discounts still do not bring the price of insulin down to an accessible and affordable place for the general population. While advocates across the United States have petitioned to have insulin prices capped at $100 or less for a month’s supply, many discount programs offered through mail order pharmacies still cost the consumer hundreds, and sometimes even thousands of dollars, for 30, 60, or 90-day supplies.
The cost of insulin depends on the consumer’s access to robust health insurance coverage or eligibility for patient assistance programs or manufacturer coupons. Unfortunately, despite marketing claims from companies like Amazon, there is no clear sign that mail order pharmacies have or will help progress the access to affordable care. Pricing on the medication still comes down to who the product is made by, not who the product is sold directly to the consumer by, particularly as insulin remains one of the most expensive liquids in the world.
For blood glucose monitors and test strips, cost-savings often lie in ordering generic or subscription versus name-brand. Some generic or subscription test strip services offer a blood glucose meter for just $10-50, then a monthly supply of test strips for $8-$50 without insurance. Whereas, with insurance at their local pharmacy, consumers may actually pay more for the name-brand meter and strips because insurance dictates which meter and strips are preferred under their formulary.
IMPACTS ON CONVENIENCE
Mail order pharmacies have been shown to save consumers time. Digital prescription management and automatic refill opt-ins make the reorder process much more efficient and accurate. Consumers are able to easily manage their prescriptions on desktop and mobile devices for many mail order pharmacies today. However, if your prescriptions are set to run at a certain time, it may be difficult to disrupt the cycle if you won’t be home, whether because of work, vacation, visiting friends & family, etc. There is also the risk of medications being left outside your door for too long or even being taken if you live in a place that is generally unsafe for receiving high-cost packages.
For people with type 1 diabetes, you may also be concerned over insulin being kept cool until you’re able to get home and move your supplies to the fridge until you’re ready to use them. Mail order pharmacies generally include cooling packs when sending insulin. Additionally, if you need to start a prescription medication ASAP that’s new, a mail order pharmacy won’t be the best option. You may opt to enroll repeat medications with your mail order pharmacy but enroll new medications with a local pharmacy in the interim.
As mentioned above, mail order pharmacies are also limited in terms of face-to-face interactions, but you are often able to call your mail order pharmacy to ask questions or address concerns. If talking to a person face-to-face is a dealbreaker for you, mail order won’t be the most valuable option. You may also run the risk of medications arriving late or damaged through mail order pharmacies.
Overall, while mail order pharmacy makes sense for a lot of Americans, especially in today’s pandemic world, it may not be the safest, most cost effective, or most valuable option for people with type 1 diabetes. In order to find out if it’s the best method for you, talk to your healthcare team and do your research. Especially when it comes to insulin, getting your medications on time and intact is something you can’t gamble on.",Dec '20

I have no neurological symptoms, but very concerned. Anyone else been diagnosed with very high GAD antibodies and not have neurological symptoms? Has anybodies endo mention to not be concerned about the high GAD antibodies?

I don’t know the number though.
He told me that high number is why I’m having these other issues.

Thank you so much for your response! Out of some of my friends with T1 none of them had as high as GAD as I have. Was yours in the thousands as well? Also, what was the doctors reasoning for putting you on statins? They haven’t suggested it to me!

I so understand your concerns and experience.  I know exactly how frustrating this is.  How can I say that?  Well I have lost about 170 pounds while being a T1.  It has not been easy and it has taken forever (it seems).  I have been at it for about 6 years now.  I weighed a little above 370 lbs.  and today i weigh 197.
i did it in two steps.  The first step was i had my endo refer me to a medically approved weight loss food program.  I ate no more than 1,200 calories per day and those calories were in special protein bars and shakes.  I ate nothing else for over 10 months.
during this tie I saw the weight loss endo every two weeks, and he adjusted my insulin each time.  He insisted my blood sugar run between 140 and 200.  At the start it was hard to stay below 200 and at the end it was difficult to stay about 140.
At that point I went off the controlled weight loss diet and promptly gained 20 pounds.   Not happy with things I started WW (Weight Watchers) and over the next 5 years I have lost an additional 70 lbs.
I consult with my CDE often, my A1C is around 5.8 and my isnulin consumption went from 8 vials per month at the start to about 3 1/2 today.

I know you are kidding, but this is such a real thing, it even has a name among eating disorder specialists, diabulimia. People destroy their bodies and go into DKA doing this (since it “works” by forcing your body into ketosis via not having enough insulin, which means you are constantly on the border of very risky DKA, not to mention doing very serious longterm harm otherwise).

And then I was out in less than 10 minutes (I was literally walked out of the consult room) and was billed $300.   I wanted to ask her to review my pump reports but it is done so hastily in the past without much thought it’s not even worth the effort.  I was told to schedule to see her again in 3 months time and in my head I’m just thinking what for?
I’m so frustrated I don’t get much out of these endo appointments at all and I find them so terribly expensive.  I don’t learn anything new and I’ve been through a few endos and they all are pretty much the same.  At one point I just stopped going.  I only went to see one recently because my pump was due for renewal and it was mandated by the pump company the endo had to sign off.  So really i was paying to get some very expensive paperwork done :(.  I just feel I’m just throwing money away, its so wasteful.

Based on the fact that his questionnaire didn’t even mention the possibility of a patient having CGM, I’m not optimistic.

It’s good that you have found someone that can help!  Perhaps my attitude towards endos would be different if I was able to get some value from my consultations even at such a high cost.
I also once had a endo who got me onto the pump and then after I was on it, I realised she knew nothing about pumping!  In our consultations, she had a million questions on how my pump works rather helping me with my condition.  I stopped going.  It seemed like she got me on because that was the “new” thing people were using to manage diabetes and I was young and tech savvy so was a perfect candidate.  I don’t regret going on the pump though and think it was a good move, but it would have been nice if she could decipher all the medtronic reports to help me.  She never looked at a single one because she didn’t know how to read them… I have since learnt that DE and endos are taught to understand those reports and make use of them.  I find it amazing how quickly my DE can understand what I was doing when she looked at the reports.",Oct '20

Yes!  This is all I want from an Endo!  But that’s a very personal choice   All  doctors, including endos, come in different flavors and personalities.  It sounds like yours is not a good fit for you.
Personally, I don’t like being told what to do by someone who had never lived with or experienced this, and has no idea what the day to day life is.  And especially not by someone who is certified by a board I don’t particularly agree with.  In the US, the AMA is controlled by politics just like everything else, and highly leans on prescription meds as a megical cure.  It’s more “treat the symptoms”, than a wholistic approach.
If you follow their prescribed regiment that their dosing guidelines give, then your data should present as a model patient.  If you’re struggling, or have had numbers, you’re defined as “non-compliant”.  We do have a different classification of doctors here, though, called DO (doctor of osteopathic medicine), which is my personal preference for doctors.  DOs tend to treat the root cause of the ailments, include alternative and homeopathicmedicines alongside traditional prescriptions, and are much more likely to teach lifestyle choices target than dictate a routine.
I no longer see an Endo.  There is only one Endo anywhere remotely close to, and that’s a 3.5 your drive away.  And each visit left me frustrated and angry.   It was everything I hate about doctors!
But then I fi6nd myself a DO Internist (doctor specializing in internal medicine) within my county, who is basically willing to write any prescriptions I want to manage my diabetes… So long as I’m able to self-manage well, because she’s unable to give me specialized advice on diabetes.  This is a perfect arrangement for me! For the first time ever, I’m happy to go talk to my doctor.  I like her!
It sounds like you actually do want a doctor to advise you, though.  If you’re not getting what you need from your medical team, then you need to shop around.  Your doctors work for you.  You’re paying them! Fire the one you’re displeased with and find one you’re happy to work with.
I don’t know if it’s normal in other countries, but in the US most doctors belong to a virtual “Patient Portal”, which gives you access to all your records.  You can see your chart notes, visit summary, all your medications,… And my personal favorite, all your lab results!  The patient portal also facilitates communication between Doctor and patient.

Well I expect the doctor to be adding value.  At the moment I don’t even see what role they play in my treatment.  I can understand seeing one when I was first diagnosed where they explain the in and outs and getting you onto insulin.  A GP probably doesn’t have this knowledge.  But I’ve passed that stage and it seems that their consults are just ticking the box to say I’ve seen one.
It’s not easy to find a good specialist.  It’s not like there is a website with all the listings and reviews - not here anyway.  You really only find one via word of mouth and if you are in luck they are close by.  I did a google on Endocronologist and basically not much showed up.

And they may be able to get the lab results if they are subscribed to the pathology that I go to but in don’t think there is a centralised database for it.  I usually bring a copy with me if I’m seeing a new doctor.
And the other thing is, my GP, the one I see for  flu and other issues, has the authority to write me prescription for my insulin.  I don’t need to visit an endo for it.  CGMS is not funded by insurance or Medicare so there is no requirement for an endo visit besides a pump renewal or the thinking  “you are a diabetic and should be seeing an endo”.  When i go to get my eyes checked, the optom would ask me when my last visit to the endo was, same with my GP so in my mind it is expected that because I’m a diabetic I should be seeing one - Rightly or wrongly.
Thinking about it more, I expect an endo to help me get my hb1ac down and guide me to maintain good diabetic control.  But I don’t seem to get this support from mine or from any of the endos I’ve seen to date.  My DE seems to be doing all that.

Is this a normal doctor or a specialist endo you are referring to?


It’s normal in the US to be required to see a doctor, any doctor really, for bureaucratic purposes.  Both because a lot of stuff that’s available over-the-counter in other countries requires a prescription in the US (like modern insulin, oral diabetes medicine, and sometimes the delivery devices), and because our insurance companies like to make us jump through hoops, otherwise they’ll find an excuse to deny coverage for our life-saving tools and medicines.  Singer states add their own flavor of hassle.  Like @mohe0001 , I had drivers licence trouble because Ohio gave me a medical restrictions card as a teenager getting my learner’s permit.  It required me to submit paperwork from my doctor every 3 months that I was responsible enough with my Diabetes to not be a threat on the road.  Except, I wasn’t able to get my license right away, so stopped submitting the forms when my permit expired… And Ohio responded by suspending a license I didn’t even have.  So I wasn’t able to actually get a driver’s license later when I was able to take drivers ed.  What a nightmare!
The catch is, insurance typically doesn’t care what sort of doctor (and sometimes other types of licensed provider, like a CDE or Nurse Practitioner) you see.  Most diabetics don’t KNOW they don’t have to see an Endo, though.  Also, it’s really up to their GP how comfortable they are handling the Diabetes diagnosis.  Most GPs have a sort of shotgun medical baseline.  I don’t mean that as a negative thing, but we’re only capable of holding so much information.  GPs generally hold onto a little bit of a lot of different things, but are most familiar with common medical complaints.  They’re most likely going to refer a patient with higher needs to someone specialized in that particular field.  But they don’t HAVE to.  If you’re lucky enough to find a GP who’s comfortable with diabetes, they might do everything you need and still satisfy the bureaucratic .",Oct '20

My endo is not the issue, its the system. I have to see someone that can prescribe insulin in the US.

 CJ114:

My diabetes is a lifelong DIY project. My endo is my drug dealer, period. She writes prescriptions for the medications I want and for the dose I feel I need.


That describes me in spades. For the last 37 years I’ve consulted with an endocrinologist every quarter. Except for a period I only went once per year as I rebelled at the idea of seeing someone who gave me little value.
At the 28-year mark, I finally took ownership of my diabetes and I made it my responsibility to learn everything I could about how my glucose metabolism works. At some point in the last nine years I finally realized that my personal knowledge about glucose control and tactics, including diet, exceeded the endos’ by orders of magnitude.
This realization at first left me angry but then my perception softened as I think doctors are also victims of a system that demoralizes them, too. So that led me to my current perception that doctors for me are primarily prescription writers.
The biggest strength of the diabetes clinic practice I see now is that they have a strong back-office that handles all the communication malfunctions of the diabetes supply companies and the payers. I verbally praise the medical assistants at every clinic visit because they are the unsung heroes in my quest to get my diabetes supplies in the correct quantity and on time.
If I want Medicare (US) to pay for my pump, CGM, and insulin supplies, I’m required to see a doctor every 90 days. I don’t seek or need any glucose management advice from the doctor. The good doctors recognize the superior knowledge I exercise and usually just tell me to keep doing what I’ve been doing. The less perceptive ones try to give me unsolicited and under-informed advice. I just ignore it while I keep my eye on the prize: their signature on an Rx order!
I’m less judgmental about all the various rules I must dance to now as I realize that these rules are made for a population and cannot be customized for me. Many people benefit from these rules and I shouldn’t inject jaded remarks into the situation because it doesn’t do anyone any good.
If left to my own devices, I would see an endo once per year or as needed. A diabetes educator or a nurse practitioner might be able to give me some good tips but I’ve already lived and learned most aspects of glucose management and my body of knowledge overwhelms theirs in depth and breadth. I do think, however that CDEs and NPs can deliver a lot of value to new patients and those newly awoken to the need for better management.",Oct '20

With the Medtronic sensors, if your pump loses its connection to the transmitter then, after the pump reconnects, the transmitter will send not just the most recent CGM value, but also all the results saved while the pump was not connected to the transmitter. Does the Dexcom transmitter do the same thing?

Thanks. I am sure I never would have stumbled across that brief reference if left to my own devices.
I am somewhat surprised that it’s only 3 hours. When Medtronic introduced the Enlite they bumped their buffer up to 8 hours (96 readings at 5 minutes per reading). On the other hand, Medtronic’s transmitter signal is weak and it is easy for the pump to become disconnected during sleep (for example).",16d

It seems the “current value” is always sent first and then usually just a little later the fill-in for earlier missed data occurs. But other times I’ve seen it take several 5-minute cycles of “current value” before all the past missing data have been filled in.
I have a suspicion the buffering may not be longer than 2 hours but have not conclusively tested it.
I also have a suspicion that the fill-in happens more frequently/reliably when the transmitter has a less-used battery. Near the 100th day the fill-in of missing data seemed particularly slow but that may have been due to other reasons.",16d

The tests to determine if you are, are first an antibody test. If it’s positive it’s a sign of being a type 1. Some type 1’s test negative and they don’t know why. The next is a c-peptide. This tells you how much insulin you are making.  Low or low normal is a sign of type 1, high or high normal is a sign of type 2. Type 1’s are lacking insulin and that takes a little bit of time to completely happen, sometimes years. Type 2’s are insulin resistant and still make insulin but don’t utilize it properly so they actually are usually trying to produce more to make up for it.
Everyone is saying to watch out for DKA. This is because this is how a lot of type 1’s end up being diagnosed because they get sick from DKA. DKA is caused by a lack of insulin. It can be serious and usually happens only to a type 1. It rarely can occur in a type 2.
I’m not saying you are but sometimes when things don’t make sense you could be a type 1.

 Timothy:

Type 2 rarely go into DKA, however those high sugars can cause a lot of damage.
You might need some insulin.


Yeah, but are Type 2s often running in the 400-500s when fasting, like OP describes? Anyone who does that, regardless of diagnosis, is clearly insulin deficient I’d think, and insulin deficiency is what puts one at risk for DKA. If your body can’t metabolize your blood glucose, even when you aren’t even eating anything new, it’s going to have to switch over to metabolizing fat instead, which means ketones, and if that’s happening at an extreme level, especially combined with the dehydration from high blood sugars,  that is what leads to DKA, which is when your blood chemistry gets off balance. Definitely worth heading off with IV fluids and insulin before it gets severe!
Another rough check for high levels ketones/DKA is to ask someone, if you’ve got someone in your germ pod, to smell your breath. Ketone breath is sort of sweet/fruity. Not nearly as good as an actual test like with urine or blood strips, but if that’s there, time to act.",Nov '20
1904,Newly Diagnosed type 2. Can’t get blood sugar down,Type 2,obxdiva,2,Kudos for reaching out! Get back with your Doctor very soon and share your lack of results. Type 2s are at a disadvantage for treatment because most Docs will stick with oral meds far too long when you actually need insulin.  The suggestion to get with a CDE very soon is great. A personalized review of your meal plans may help. There is so much to learn about carb counting and your personal response to foods.The main point is be your own advocate.  Yes you could be misdiagnosed. But just be pushy on your own behalf to get results you need.  One step at a time and realize you’re in it for the long haul.,Nov '20

Today is Thanksgiving.
Today is typically a high ER traffic day, but you can’t be eating a bunch of stuff, so it might be better to just go into the ER.

You can eat:


Sugar free jello
Celery with peanut butter on it
Salad
A bit of popcorn (less than 3 cups)
Sugar free fluids - like diet coke, water, crystal light flavored water.

If you must eat something more substantial - eat meat.

NO SUGAR SODA, NO JUICE, NO BREAD.

You can buy ketone strips at the drug store.

You might want to call the ER before you go in and let them know the situation.
If it is busy in there, you can always wait outside and tell them to come get you when they are ready. Or, go by ambulance. That’s the way to get in fast (its expensive, but its fast and you won’t be waiting for hours in the waiting room with a bunch of covid people). Its worth the $ because I don’t think that you should get covid now in your current condition.
@cardamom is right about the IV fluids. Your gonna need your blood chemistry checked. Diabetes turns your blood into soup.
@obxdiva, is recommending a CDE - that’s a Certified Diabetes Educator. They need to schedule you with one of those. That will be a nurse who talks to you about all this stuff in an outpatient clinic appointment.",Nov '20

@Jungle, if you feel a little funny about calling an ambulance when you feel perfectly fine, you can always just blame us.
Call 911 and tell them what your blood sugar is. Tell the medics that you are a brand new diabetic and that your blood sugar is very high. Tell them that the diabetics online said that you needed to go to the ER. They will be able to take it from there. If the ER is a mess and they don’t think that you need to go by ambulance, then you should not be charged anything - the ambulance should charge only for transport and care provided during transport (but that’s not always 100% true). They might tell you to drive in (I don’t think they will, but things are strange, now - especially because its a holiday).

If you aren’t ready to go to an ER right now, and you have means of getting to a pharmacy, I would immediately go get ketone strips (simple urine test). Again, if those are registering as high, you need to go the ER no matter how you feel.
Regardless, it really sounds like you need insulin urgently, and not to just wait on the metformin before getting some kind of immediate medical help that provides better treatment options. If you aren’t in DKA yet, you are likely at risk for it with those numbers that high, that consistently. And DKA can kill you—it almost killed me once, and that was awful.

If you haven’t started making ketones yet, you can prevent it with insulin that they can give you to lower your blood sugar.  At the very least go out and get some ketone strips so you can see more of what is going on. Those numbers show a lack of available insulin, and that is what causes DKA. The thirst is a desperate way of your body trying to flush them out. But it is obvious you need insulin so a trip to the ER is the best solution.

Check your history for alerts.  Should alert about a week or so before 90 transmitter days.
If you have xDrip or dexcom app, you should see transmitter start date or days used.
I hope Tandem will add feature to see days used in T:Connect nstead of just status of “battery ok”.  I mentioned this on last call.
Search for restart sensor, and you will find instructions on removing transmitter.
Here’s one example.




Dexcom restarts beyond 8G? Glucose Monitoring


    Curious whether anyone has been able to restart a sensor with a transmitter in the 8H, 8I, 8J series or later? 
If they’ve finally closed off all the hacks, it will suggest to me to keep restarting my current sensor(s) with my one 8G as long as possible to build up my backup supply.

 Robyn_H:

You can’t start a new session after day 100. It gives you a hard stop after 110 days, the max transmitter life. Most of mine have died on their own before I got to 110, though.


So the best case scenario is to restart the sensor on day 99.  I don’t know whether it’s worth inserting a new sensor on day 99 since (as @Jim26 mentioned above)you cannot restart it with a new transmitter.    I wonder how the sensor knows it’s a new transmitter.",9d
1922,Changing a G6 transmitter,Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,1,"You can restart your sensor with a new transmitter.  Same exact way you’ve been doing it, except this time you you need to change the transmitter ID on the pump and your phone.  It’s just not in any of the official protocols since according to Dexcom, you can’t restart.  Normally you would have to call Tandem for a replacement sensor, because theoretically, that sensor can’t be used once you get the “cannot start new session” error, because it’s full of a dead transmitter with no way to remove it.
Of course, we know better.  So when you get the error, just pop the old transmitter out, change the ID in your settings, and insert the new transmitter into your existing sensor.



 tedos:

So the best case scenario is to restart the sensor on day 99.


That’s my tendancy, just in case.  You should be able to get away with doing it on day 100, though.  I tend to do day 99 just to be safe.",9d
1923,Changing a G6 transmitter,Diabetes Technology,Edward_Reid,1,"There are videos on Youtube showing how to remove a transmitter without breaking the sensor. Here’s two; the second is shorter but the first is better focused. The only tools you need are two used test strips.
G6 Transmitter Removal without breaking the sensor

G6 transmitter removal without breaking the sensor
When the transmitter is nearly done for, a sensor change will elicit a warning “this is the last session with this transmitter, make sure you have another on hand”. I think that it then will not allow you to start another new session with the same transmitter, EVEN IF that sensor fails early.
That’s how it’s supposed to work. It appears to be purely based on time since activating the transmitter, not on measurement of the battery condition. Sometimes the transmitter battery dies early. In this case you get a “transmitter battery critically low” alert. When this happened to me a few months ago, it only lasted a couple more hours.
If this happens, Dexcom will replace the sensor, since you cannot [are not supposed to be able to] put in a new transmitter with the same sensor.
However, the transmitter is guaranteed for only 90 days despite normally lasting for 110 days. A few months ago, my transmitter failed at 91 days. Dexcom replaced the sensor but not the transmitter. (I already had a new transmitter and sensors on hand, so it was an annoyance but no gap in coverage.)
Just a few days ago, my transmitter failed (“battery critically low”) at 58 days during a sensor swap. I explained that I didn’t lose a sensor, but they are shipping replacements for both sensor and transmitter anyway. I guess they just assume that “battery critically low” means a lost sensor.
Just recently – past couple of months I think – I no longer have to wait on the phone to report early sensor or transmitter failure. The last two cases, I just filled out the support form online. With the simple sensor failure, I also had to respond to an email with a couple of other questions – just the basic questions they ask on the phone. With the transmitter failure, I did not even have to do that.
I’m not sure how the above needs to be adjusted if you have restarted a sensor. I gave up on restarting because I seldom get good results after a restart. For me, sensors fail at 8 or 9 days about as often as they go a full ten days. I have built up a few to experiment with as a result …

I realize that the cgm needs 2 calibrations per day


Just a reminder. When I was using the Guardian 3 CGM with a 630G, you were required to calibrate every 6 hours for the first 4 (I think) calibrations immediately after the initial sensor warm-up. Calibrations were every 12 hours only after this roughly first 24 hours of more frequent calibrations.
I assume this was because the sensor had still not reached a sufficient equilibrium and needed more frequent calibrations to stay on track. I found this annoying, sure. But my primary goal was to be able to trust my CGM results so I just worked with it.
Maybe it will be different with the 770G. I have not seen any feedback about this from 770G users so I just don’t know one way or another.",4d

I’m new here, and I was hoping I could get some help.
I was diagnosed with type II in mid-June of 2019. I had to replace my first OneTouch Verio Flex in November of that year because the readings were off. I thought it was damaged from travel.

1962,OneTouch Verio Flex inaccurate readings,Diabetes Technology,Peter10,,"I’ve also found the readings from my OneTouch Verio Flex to be a source of frustration.
The general 20% allowance by FDA is bad enough (a reading of say 120 could mean you are anywhere from 96 to 144)! However, even within the meters themselves there seems to be a discrepancy:
Earlier this year, I did a blood test, but I did it as a control test. It was my first test of the morning and I if my BSL was high I didn’t want it to record since my provider can see my results (but not the results when using the control setting, since it’s typically reserved for the testing solution).
I was happy when I saw it was in the “Green” so I immediately took another test the correct way (using a new pin prick), but this time the result was ±30 points higher. I’m in the “Red”!
I understand that you can get two different readings (it was two separate pin-pricks about 30 seconds apart) but this seemed like a big difference.
I’ve repeated this test several times now over a few months (this time using the same pinprick and drop of blood, in the hope of making it more accurate) and the results when using the meter set to ‘Control’ is ALWAYS different by somewhere between ±15-±30 points.
Once again, the difference is annoying but I can understand it’s possible. However, EVERY TIME when the control setting is selected, it is ALWAYS lower, if it were a simple case of two samples being slightly off, then there should be times when the “Control” test on my blood is higher, but that has never happened, It’s as though the meter is designed to show a lower number when using the Control setting.
I’ve done this test also using the test solution bottle and again it is off by ±15-30 points each time and when the control test is selected, the number is ALWAYS lower.
I also found my old OneTouch Verio Flex  (that I had previously misplaced), and there are the same discrepancies with that one: the numbers are ALWAYS lower when selecting ‘Control’ by almost the same margin!
To add more complication when I test my sugar level (again same pin-prick) with both meters the older one shows a lower reading than the newer one (somewhere between ±12-±26 points) EVERY time!
So which meter should I trust to be accurate and which to be wrong!? They both pass the control solution test! Is my sugar low when my old meter shows that I am 65 (using control seting) or am I fine because the newer meter (that is the same model) says that I am 110 (without control)!?
I did another test today (22-DEC-2021) using my new meter only:

Using control solution:
With Control set, it was 121. Using the exact same drop on a new strip AND not selecting a Control and it was 137! A 16% difference.
Using the same drop of my blood:
With Control set, it was 63, but without Control set it was 75!  A 12% difference.

Like I said, frustrating.",17d

If you do the research. I think you will find that the numbers you are getting from Verio Flex, they would consider totally normal and within their tolerances.  You are within the ranges I always got with various One Touch meters before switching to Contour Next One.
You may want to consider a Contour Next One meter if you are looking for tighter results.

Yes the Medtronic is (in my opinion) entirely too sensitive to the least bit of resistance.  This is called occlusion.  There are three things I do in this case.
First disconnect the pump and run a prime.  htis will clear any issue in the tubing or in the cartridge.
Second, be sure you are not using fast delivery.  This is incredibly susceptible to this issue.
Finally, if it keeps happening - hate to say this - pull the site and place a new one.  If the cannula is bent, that is the answer.  Regardless i tend to not put the cannula in a place near the site you just pulled.
If the occlusion keeps happening it might bee the pump motor, though this is rare.  Usually it is the site in one way or another.

Same for me.  I’ve used two different medtronic pumps prior to tslim this year.  Medtronic sensors are terrible.  In hindsight, I should have asked them for my money back for my link 1 and 2 transmitters and sensors - it was the worst value investment I ever made.  I still had sensors left that I paid out of pocket that I didn’t use because they were stressing me out so much because of the inaccuracies.   When i called support, they made it sound like it was only me having these problems and I was the “one off” case that didn’t work so I just thought it was my bad luck.  It was only this year that I realised so many others were in the same boat.  The medtronic pump good and comparable to the tslim I think however, tslim I think is more forward thinking.
It saddens me that medtronic is still the major player in the australian market.  When I had to choose my new pump, I had my mind set on the tslim but my DE tried to convince me to go medtronic.  I think they are trained and have more support from medtronic so they are more comfortable with that pump.  She also gave me the impression the generation 3 of the medtronic sensors were close to flawless.  Thanks to this forum I did my research and found that people are still complaining about their medtronic sensor so it was an obvious “no go” for me.

The sensors were not great. I always gave up on them due to how many false alarms there was. And for away I had  Medtronic pump with Dexcom sensor, which worked very well for me. Their customer service was always great, although I never really had to call them with issues. I mean, the pumps just work! I am still a fan of the durability of these pumps!
But I made the switch because I wanted less work. After all these years, I want less thinking about my diabetes.

Thee are days that I can go 12+ hours without eating, so it’s cool that I don’t need to think about it. I wanted easy and got it now. I also like the fact that as the company comes up with new upgrades, I don’t need to wait for warranty to expire, I can download the new program and keep the same pump.
I will say, just because I like my Tandem, doesn’t mean it’s the best fit for everyone. Picking a pump is a big deal. You need to think about what you really love about your current system and what you hate about it. And you really need to get your hands on one and play with it. Hear the alarms, see about doing a new site change, batteries vs chargeable, computer & phone compatibility. So much to think about. No one pump makes everyone happy.

2006,When I’m getting old,Type 1 and LADA,K_Hjalmar,9,"So I’m starting to get to the point where I can refer to myself as an “oldster.” I’m 73 now, and have had Type 1 for just under 60 years (60 in December).
I’m still in pretty good health. My A1c’s are in the 6’s; my cholesterol is excellent, as is my other bloodwork. We walk daily, 1-3 miles; we do stretching and a little bit of weight work a couple times a week. I’ve got a mild case of Afib, and slightly high blood pressure, but not bad.
I’ve used an insulin pump for about 20 years. I just switched over to a Tandem t:slim and a Dexcom G6 a few months ago, both of which I love.
We have no children. We live comfortably in a medium apartment (by choice, as of a few years ago). My wife has been invaluable in managing my meals and other aspects of my life. I feel like I, and we, are in good control of things right now; certainly I have plenty of experience! 
So my question to you is: what happens when/if I can no longer, due to physical or mental disability, manage for myself? My wife and I have discussed this recently. She is not a techno-geek like I am, and is intimidated by all that goes into managing my various gadgets. She thinks she could manage to handle giving my multiple injections, as I did years ago, but doesn’t feel qualified to manage even the pump, much less the CGM. And of course the t:slim is a bit more complicated than my old Medtronic 580. I won’t inflict that kind of stress on her.
The only alternative I see is an assisted-living place that could manage my pump and CGM adequately. But do such places even exist? It seems to me it would take a lot of high-level skill for a staffer in such a place to be able to provide that level of care. I’d hate to put my life in the hands of someone who isn’t trained for it, and I don’t think I can expect that of most facilities.
Are there alternatives I’m not thinking of? How are some of you other oldsters, especially older-than-me-sters, handling these challenges? I should be able to manage everything for quite a while, I’m sure, but eventually I’ll have to face this problem. Any ideas?

Are there alternatives I’m not thinking of?


Hi:
I am a little younger so similar thoughts cross my mind but not quite there yet as still a very young, active 72 year old this year.  My mother, however, is 98 and has her own apartment in a senior living facility and she can stay there and make her own meals and laundry or go downstairs and be fed and someone comes in once a week for cleaning and laundry and anything else she needs.  The company that owns this and many similar facilities also has the next level up centers that are assisted-living.
That gives the individual maximum flexibility in how to control their own life as long as they are able to.  My mother can hire either on her own or through her facility whatever help she needs to do whatever she can’t handle on her own to come in to help her out.  A few of the tenants, I believe, have full time help living within their apartments, but that staff is still controlled by the tenant.  Just another option you may want to consider depending on where you are living and what facility types are available but the variety just keeps growing year after year.",Jul '20
2008,When I’m getting old,Type 1 and LADA,Robyn_H,,"There are also home health options, where they send someone to your home, as often as deemed necessary.  Not everyone has medical training, as some people just need someone to make sure they’re getting an occasional healthy meal and general cleaning.  But complete nursing services are available, too, for more extensive medical needs. I think that option would assume that someone in the house can at least handle meal boluses and emergency hypo treatments, though.",Jul '20

But she is not diabetic and I have a feeling finding someone that is skilled at handling pump management would be really hard to find. They would have to be trained (on all the pumps) and have familiarity with all the pumps and also diabetes. That might be kind of hard. You probably are more able to find someone that can handle MDI shots because they can start at certain “formulas” they can follow for injections.
I think it is exciting with the new loop pumps. This will help a lot if a doctor or diabetic manager can just program the pump and let it do it’s thing. Sure you might run a little higher than you like, spike after meals more etc…but in the long run better than someone stepping in to do shots because you would have the same issue.",Jul '20

Can you say: “Pull the plug …”.
I have a down payment on a Continuing Care Life Community and will likely move in near the end of 2021 when I will have just turned 72. A new building is under construction …
For us boomers, many of the best senior living options ALREADY have a 5-10 year waiting list that is going up by the year. Also, a number of the places where you can easily upgrade from independent living to assisted living to memory care or full-on nursing have a health entry requirement. In other words, if you wait too long you may not qualify … even if they don’t have a waiting list.
As far as diabetes management, that is a good question, and I don’t have good answers. Here is my guess: if you needed someone to change CGM sensors and or infusion sets, you could probably (but not yet easily …) find someone to do that and I expect that is a skill set that is easier to find in 2-5 years. If, however, you could no longer manage your own boluses, until it gets more automated, I’ll bet there would be pressure to go to nurse (or equivalent) administered MDI because that is a commonly available skill set.
Of course, I expect that we will all live long enough to have fully automated insulin and glucagon pumps where we will only need to worry about an occasional sensor change and fluid topoff … and the system will do the rest!

And that is double for T1.
I will be 80 at the end of this year, live alone on a large farm in rural Wisconsin, and could not even get enough home health help to keep my husband at home. He was in a nursing home for 16 months until he died beginning of this year. I watched patients there line up in their wheelchairs before meals to be given their shot of bolus insulin. I am sure that no one had any kind of insulin pump. And the shots of insulin the nurses gave were probably inadequate. I plan to check out rather than become dependent upon the health care workers out there.
My suggestion to you? Teach your wife about your pump and the CGM. Teach her to change the cartridges and install the sensors. It really is quite simple but needs concentration. Parents are doing it for their children. A wife should be able to do it for a husband. Good luck!",Jul '20

Of course, there are lots of types of facilities that constitute “senior living”:  my brother lives in a place that is all 55 and over … but has NO assisted living or health care. There are the full spectrum (independent, assisted, rehab care, long term, and memory care) and then there are places that ONLY have some or all of the higher levels of care, and certainly have no independent living.
It is certainly tricky.
I apologize if I overstated the waiting list thing … I’m sure you are correct that not all areas have waiting lists and they ARE building new facilities all the time. Finding good staff for all senior facilities is an issue.
In this case, I like doing my homework before having an imminent need. I’ve certainly been to places that seem nice enough on the outside … but things seem not so good once you walk around and get a feel for the place.

I kinda agree with Willow’s position. Although, I recognize how hard it is to ‘train’ someone for diabetes care. You really need the right person. They need an inclination in that direction. I will add one depressing complication. I spent years training the perfect diabetes caregiver and that person dropped dead expectantly. There is no replacement. During covid, the best I have been able to come up with is a special ‘diabetes emergency box.’ If all they do is bring that box to the hospital, that will be good. It contains an ‘emergency folder,’ with emergency care information. It is many pages long and will be confusing.

At 67, I’m a few years younger than you and have lived with T1D for 36 years but still face the same daunting prospect. When I moved to the same city as my adult daughter, I harbored some hope that I might be able to hand off enough diabetes skill (pump and CGM) to her so that at least she could be informed enough to influence better diabetes care for me.
I started to develop some basic diabetes written material that I think provides an essential foundation to managing insulin dependent diabetes. I covered topics like the metabolic nature of insulin and food including the topics of basal and bolus insulin. My idea was that she could slowly learn this material over time.
My daughter soon shared with me that she was intimidated by this task. She knows the competence I hold managing my diabetes and she doesn’t think she could ever rise to step in and help me. I didn’t want to push things so I just left it at that.
I don’t feel much hope of any institution managing my diabetes well. Even the endocrinologists and educators do not understand my diabetes like I do. They seem more focused on standards used to treat a population and less interested in treatment tactics specific to me.
These practitioners are at the top skill level to address my daily insulin management and even they fall well short of the task. How can we expect the marginally trained and poorly paid senior living center staff to ever be able to help us?
I think I need to make peace with the idea that if or when I lose my cognitive ability, I will drop into poor glucose control and be vulnerable to the many things that could kill me. This is the classic situation that the elderly have always faced but with a diabetes spin on it.
In the meantime, I will use that fearful prospect to do everything in my power to mitigate my cognitive decline.

Anyone have any ideas about solving the problem of the lust for garbage carbohydrates


Best description I have heard in years. It is a lust fed by a survival instinct gone amuck.  I dare say that if this errant survival instinct could be tamed we would make great strides into preventing type 2.
The human body was not designed to live in a land of constant plenty. It was designed for times of plenty followed by times of struggle. It is a strong basic instinct that tells us to indulge during times of plenty so that we will survive the times of food struggle.
The intensity of these instincts varies greatly in the human population, local conditions and evolution have made this so.  It is no coincidence that type 2  is seen more often in populations that have traditionally struggled to survive but now no longer struggle.
That was a long winded explanation why many type 2 like @MapleSugar and myself lust for garbage carbs. The problem for her and for me is much more difficult than many members here might be able to understand.  We are not fighting against lack of willpower here, were fighting a basic instinct.

1.) Nuts. delicious. I have a giant bag of walnuts on my counter than my friends mom got me hooked on - she says walnuts are good for you. I eat them every time I’m standing there. Nuts are best with dried fruit and candy, but I know we gotta limit that stuff. I dilute the fruit and candy with nuts, to a degree that is reasonable, but not excessive.
2.) Taco salad
Do you like Taco salads? I’ve been enjoying a lot of taco salads. It helps dilute the taco with a bit with salad and is still delicious. Plate of chips with melted cheese on top. Then, LOTS of shredded lettuce. Make the lettuce delicious by topping with salsa and sour cream. To further dilute the bad, add (warm) beans to the mix. If there’s enough lettuce, then this works out to be healthy and filling and full of protein (its not much bad stuff - just a little chips and cheese, and some sour cream).
3.) A good spinach or dill dip - goes good on everything, even celery. A good spinach dip makes celery delicious. But, you must have a wide variety of the best veggies to make this good - cherry tomatoes, yellow squash, mushrooms. But, those are too delicate to be filling. You need meaty, fibrous veggies like cauliflower and broccoli. Have some cheese and crackers on the plate, too. Maybe some peanut butter crackers.
The trick to mac and cheese (which has been a pandemic staple here) is to dilute it with broccoli and fresh tomatoes. I like to always dilute noodles with ‘meaty’ vegetables.
I’ve also been mad for crock pot veggie lasagna because its so easy to make. The proportion of veggies to pasta is quite high. There’s actually not a lot of carb in it if your using hearty, ‘meaty’ vegetables like broccoli and zucchini and spinach and yellow squash. Use a good pesto. I made one this morning very quickly. It will last for days.",15d

Why must you stop eating garbage? Is there something that is not working after eating it?


Yes, several things, but one is very important;  Since taking Ozempic (and before that, Victoza) I get extremely unpleasant digestive symptoms when I eat a lot of carbohydrates.  (In fact, I don’t think that it’s true that Ozempic and Victoza have very unpleasant side-effects; that is a lie spread by the enemies of the human race.  Ozempic or Victoza +carbohydrates have very unpleasant side effects.  And I have strong suspicions about metformin+carbohydrates.)
I would like to do something about the carbohydrate attacks because they make me feel so bad physically, as above.

@rcarli I’m sorry to read about your ongoing arterial complications - it can’t be easy for you.
I recall that at some point you had a kidney transplant. Have any of your docs suggested that kidney disease played a role with your arterial calcification? Or did they just surmise that years of diabetes, high blood sugars and hypertension all were contributing factors?

For me the plaque had begun to calcify so that there was less of a passageway for blood to move through the veins and arteries. So 20 years ago I had a bypass in my bad leg in which they put a vein from another part of my body and replaced the vein that was almost totally calcified and blocked. That’s saved my leg for about 8 years before that vein became calcified.  Fortunately I had increased my walking and running activities
and developed ancillaries or capillaries in that leg which continued to bring blood flow to my toes. For me it was walking and running that allowed me to keep the leg for 20 years and should be beneficial to others as well. Even though veins and arteries were clogged the small capillaries allowed blood to move down my leg into my foot. I encourage everyone to increase their blood flow activities such as walking.

2100,"Neuropathy, Toes/Feet and Doxycycline",Type 1 and LADA,rcarli,4,"Continuing…
After moving from Boston to Raleigh North Carolina, I found the bypass was no longer effective and had an angiogram (which may also be referred to as an arteriogram) but it was obvious that it was totally calcified and it was the ancillaries to the toes that kept me from having the leg amputated. For another 10 years I just kept walking and exercising my legs and everything was okay until about 18 months ago. For the first time I noticed a sore on one of my toes. With a lot of walking that started to get better until last March. I was walking in one inch of snow in the temperature was about 35°. The next day it was determined my toes had gotten frostbitten. That was the start of the end. I had another angiogram to give my leg the best chance of healing and then was sent for hyperbaric oxygen therapy. For 2 hours every day for more than 2 months I had to lie in a chamber which forced pressured oxygen and doxycycline down my leg. That didn’t work and I went to a final try of wearing and arterial boot. It’s simulated walking and was supposed to be 86% effective specifically for diabetics trying to save their limb… after 5 months the pain was excruciating and I said I had done all I could and elected to have surgery.
In summary,
Due to years of high blood sugars many years ago, my veins and arteries in my legs in my whole body began to calcify at some point.  I have also been told that for everyone age alone can cause a small amount of calcification.
my first attempt to save my leg was bypass surgery about 20 years ago.
my best attempt to save the leg was walking walking walking.
I also underwent three angiograms including stents to open up the arteries a bit.
Then came hyperbaric oxygen therapy for about 2 months.
then 5 months of wearing an arterial boot at home for about 2 hours a day.
Finally amputation which has believed all the pain I was feeling trying to save the leg.
That’s my story as I’m laying in a hospital bed waiting to go home hopefully today. I’m told that after therapy in the prosthetic my life will be as it has been. I’m positive I’ll get there.",Dec '20

Dawn phenomenon: what is it, what causes it, and how do you fix it? 1
The dawn phenomenon, sometimes referred to as the “dawn effect,” has earned its name from the recurrence of elevated blood glucose (a.k.a. sugar) around the hours of waking, roughly between 4-8 AM. This is largely caused by hormone changes, and there...





",Nov '20
2104,Overnight highs,Type 1 and LADA,Timothy,1,"My dawn phenomenon is never that severe,
However you are lifting weights so you need to consider that.
When you work out your muscles ,they can actually release sugar before they start using sugar.
When your muscles are damaged from injury or working out ,they can become leaky and leak sugar while your body is trying to repair them.
This is normal as we sort of tear our muscles a tiny bit when working out and then they grow bigger.
That’s why you feel sore after working out.
I had a similar issue when it was on a rowing team in college.
I would have this incredibly big spike after gym and after rowing hard for competition etc.
My doctor told me I was overdoing my workouts, so I eased up a bit but it’s really hard to do when you are on a team.
My issues got better from not pushing so much.
However I tended to just increase my basal insulin 25 percent for 6 hours from start of my workout.
That formula helped me a lot when I was on injections. However now on a pump I think it would be easier to manage.
I’m too old for all that now but I still spike after aggressive hikes or trail running. If my muscles are sore, I just expect I’ll get high for a few hours.",Nov '20

Now with my Tandem, it can handle the changes that happen each and everyday. Some nights, I need more insulin and some nights I need less and this pump just handles it. So like last night I went low around 3 & it turned off before I got an alarm. But 2 nights ago, it had my basal almost double my normal rate. So cool to not have to think about it.
Not saying a pump is what you have to do, but sometimes thinking about different treatment plans might be a possibility. I was not happy about wearing a piece of equipment 24/7 but now after all these years, I don’t even think about it.
And of course as with everything diabetes, sometimes there is just no reason for the blood sugar and it is useless to try and figure it out.

Good for you for adopting this tactic. It’s not always convenient when the blood sugar decides to go higher and you’re ready for some down time.

They are specifically waiting to vacc HIV because they a concerned that the vacc could hurt them in some way. They state it very explicitly.
Medical risks are sooo dependent of the individual. Everybody is different.
Vaccine priorities are still very much in flux among illness groups.
We do NOT know that T1’s will have any priority. T2’s will.

1.) Are they unprepared to vacc T1’s because they think we are more medically vulnerable? We are in the same vacc boat as HIV - both are in the category of not having a large enough data sample to proceed with early vacc. They have issued strong warnings about HIV & vacc, but not for us. That leads me to believe that for some individuals, they perceive risk.
2.) I assume that there is a reason that these vacc protocols have been established.
The agreements between the State and the Feds are to follow the CDC guidelines for delivery. They are currently supposed to be doing healthcare providers, not EVERY hospital employee that is working remote. That appears to me to be a violation of medical ethics. If we can’t trust the hospital to follow some standard of medical ethics in this very serious situation where everyone is watching, WTF?!?!? Why should we anticipate that anyone will follow protocol?
Does the non-adherence to protocol put people at undue risk? The hospital wants people back in the office. That’s their only justification for doing this. Are they putting my friend at risk by pushing him to the front of the line for vacc before CDC has issued hard and fast guidelines? It feels safer to vacc with your illness group, once risks are better established.

At the most most macro public health level, it doesn’t matter a lot which group you vaccinate first. You won’t stop the virus until 80-90% of everyone is vaccinated.

No one has said that Type 2s should not get the vaccination but rather the Tennessee state vaccination plan says that type 2 is a comorbidity and should be given high priority, same with many other comorbidities like kidney disease, heart/arterial disease, lung disease, sickle cell disease and obesity, this is not a complete list.  On this plan Type 1 is on the next priority level, making a difference in timing of about a month.
Tennessee’s plan is based on CDC guidelines. I have to believe that the safety of the vaccines for diabetic populations has been considered, why else would we be on the priority lists.

But, the hospital wants everybody who worked physically onsite prior to covid lockdowns vaccinated. A friend of mine in billing will be vaccinated next week.
I suspect that this is because they want those guys back in the office, so they are bumping them to the front of the line.


One other possibility is that with the surge-on-surge, hospital workers (for example in billing) might be “called to duty” for the surge, and thus should be vaccinated. This is happening with my spouse, who is in hospital administration but may need to deliver food/perform other tasks.",4d

2168,Anyone familiar with Humalog 200,Treatment,Yifat,,"My son is a teenager and takes large amounts of insulin to cover increased hormones and a large volume of food. He is quite thin but eats a lot, as teenage boys often do, thus he pumps 100+ units a day (basal + bolus). Since this is a tremendous amount of insulin to absorb through his infusion set I requested Humalog 200 so we can dose 1/2 the amount. Does any have any experience with Humalog 200?",Dec '19
2169,Anyone familiar with Humalog 200,Treatment,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,1,"I use it!  I’ve heard it’s better than the U-100. I’m not sure about that but It was originally thought I might have to change my pod every 2 days because of my usage so they prescribed the 200. It turns out my usage went down so much it wasn’t necessary.
But I liked it so I stayed with it and only use about 25 measured units of it or really 50 units of insulin a day. Which brings me to the point it can be confusing for people at times who aren’t used to it. Please be aware of that if you switch from using the pen and pump at all.
My endo that put me on the pump is the one that originally prescribed it. When I moved the endo here originally wrote the prescription for 25 units a day of U-200, but it can’t be written like that, it still has to be written as 50 units of insulin. When I have talked to the mail order pharmacy staff before, they completely understood, but this last time the lady I talked to didn’t have a clue and then wanted to half the prescription when I tried to explain it to her. Because you fill up a pod or reservoir by volume. So as soon as I mentioned I put 80 units volume into my pod for 3 days her understanding went out the window.
And Humalog does not want to hear it’s for a pump, I guess it’s not “approved” for it. So if you talk to them for any reason just don’t mention that. My endo that prescribed it said she did so all the time and she was a type 1 herself. It only comes in a pen.
The other thing is it’s helpful to have someone familiar with programming helping you with programming the initial pump numbers, you don’t have to, but at first it’s a little confusing. Everything is virtually doubled. So on the I/C programming if I take 1 unit for 7 carbs, I have to put 1 unit for 14 carbs etc. 1 unit for 25 correction is 1 unit for 50.

@Marie20, does Omnipod formally approve of U200 use in its pumps?
I’ve never used concentrated insulin, beyond the U100 kind. I know from a few threads here that people are often confused about the concept.
Ten units of U100 or U200 or U500 are all equivalent insulin doses. The liquid volume of each of those 10-unit doses is different. U200 is one half the volume of U100 and U500 is one fifth the U100 volume.
Where important safety mistakes are made is when someone uses, for example, a U100 syringe to draw up insulin from a higher concentration insulin vial. This can and has led to insulin overdoses.
Sorry to veer somewhat off-topic here, @Yifat. I just wanted readers to think about the safety aspects of using insulin of a different concentration than what the equipment was designed for.
Larger volume insulin doses are slower to perform. Halving the volume of insulin your son uses for the same meal dose will likely give him better performance.  I would try it if I were faced with that situation.",Dec '19

2182,Higher risk with low Vitamin K levels,COVID-19,CJ114,3,"Vitamin K is a complex issue to properly manage.  I have been working on a 1 year project to reduce the calcium build up in my heart arteries as well as other arteries and redirect the calcium where it belongs to my teeth and bones.  There is a lot of research on this to prevent cardiac events that has been done in Japan, Europe and Canada but little to none in the US.  In the US, we don’t normally try to prevent a cardiac event, we let the event happen and then have the best doctors in the world to fix our broken hearts if we survive the event.  Acting in a pro-active fashion is not profitable and therefore rarely practiced in the US.
I have learned over the past 6 months that taking Vitamin K is totally ineffective unless taken with the proper amount of Vitamin D3 and Vitamin A.  The balance is important and finding vitamin K in various doses in the US is next to impossible.  Additionally, proper Vitamin K is needed, with the greatest concentration being in Vitamin K2, long chain MK7 version.
Within the first 6 months of taking the cocktail I believe is the best for me, I have seen some initial success.  To monitor my success, I have a CT heart scan every 6 months to determine my CAC score.  After a full year, I will evaluate if being proactive with Vitamin K is worth the effort or if it is mostly just hype or if it has other non planned benefits or issues.

Background:


I’m in the process of switching from a Medtronic 630G pump using their Guardian 3 CGM sensors to a Tandem t:slim X2 with CIQ pump and Dexcom G6 sensors. I’m still using the 630G since (1) I need to set up an online training session with Tandem and (2) I still have unused Medtronic supplies.


I get my medical care & diabetic supplies through the VA hospital nearest to me (Syracuse, NY). How this has worked so far is the doctor at the VA who treats me writes VA prescriptions for the pump & CGM. Then, after some internal paper shuffling, the VA ships the pump & CGM supplies to me.


The point I am trying to make here is that I never actually deal directly with either Tandem or Dexcom. Their sales’ departments don’t really know me as I never place an order for anything with either company. The companies deal directly with the VA not with me. The VA is their customer, not me.


The VA has shipped me a Tandem t:slim X2 with CIQ pump and the supplies to use that pump. The VA has also shipped me Dexcom G6 sensors and two Dexcom G6 transmitters. The VA did not ship me a Dexcom G6 receiver. So the only way I have to monitor the data from the G6 CGM is via the Tandem pump.
Note: I can not use the Dexcom G6 app as a receiver for the G6. My phone is an Android Motorola Moto G7 and the Dexcom app refuses to work on it.


I suppose I could just fill up a t:slim insulin cartridge, slam on a Tandem infusion set and then have at it. But I would prefer to try out the G6 CGM first. Then, after getting a feel for using the G6 I’d add on actually using the Tandem t:slim to pump insulin.
So I’m wondering if the Tandem pump will still function to monitor the G6 sensors even if it doesn’t have any insulin in it to pump? Anyone out there know?    
(One reason I’m not really expecting an answer is because I couldn’t answer this same question if you asked it to me about Medtronic pumps. Although I’ve been using Medtronic’s CGM with their pumps for over 6 years now, I never tried to find out if I could use their pump to monitor their CGM without also using it to pump insulin. One of those things that just “never came up”. Oh, well.  )",Nov '20

My current understanding is that getting a G6 receiver from Dexcom would cost ~$375 to $400, maybe? I’m not sure how much less than that it would cost me to get an Apple phone.
Also, since I currently expect to be using the Tandem t:slim as my main pump before the year ends, I probably wouldn’t be able to get my hands on a used phone alternative before it became markedly less useful to me.

My guess is that yes, this would work, essentially a receiver only.
You might be able to put empty reservoir on, but NOT do steps to load insulin.
Another option is to load xDrip on android phone, which will read cgm data direct from G6 transmitter.
You could also load the hacked version of G6 app, that works on non-supported android phones.
But if all you want is G6 with medtronic pump, leave tandem in box, and just use xDrip on phone.
And then add a watch that can display cgm data from xDrip.

I would strongly recommend not turning it on until you’re ready to start programming your settings, at the very least.
If you really want, you could fill a reservoir with water, and let the pump think it’s pumping insulin.  Don’t infuse it, though!  Just let it leak out.  Or, you could get saline dirt cheap from the pharmacy that CAN be infused.  Lots of new pumpers do this to safely practice with kids before plugging real insulin into it.
Or, you can download an Android app for your phone.  There’s are several options besides the Dexcom one.  Xdrip is my favorite, and so much ridiculously better than the Dexcom app!  You can’t get it on the Playstore, though.  It has to be sideloaded.  If you don’t know how to do that just goggle “sideloading” AND your phone model.

You can also download an app that simulates the pump menus.

 MM1:

Have you checked out any of the online tandem training video?


Yes, I’ve viewed what I think are the most pertinent training vids. But I find I have to be careful to avoid older trainings which refer to t:slim menus which don’t match my pump’s software version (Moonlight v7.4).
Even though I myself have never ordered anything from Tandem, I have been able to create a Tandem account in my name which contains my pump info. Apparently Tandem’s account software used my email address in the VA pump order to connect the account I created for myself with the pump the VA ordered for me.
Unfortunately that account does not (yet?) point me towards a list of specific training videos for my t:slim X2. Instead the account’s home page displays the message “No activities are assigned to you at this time”. The closest I’ve been able to come to a training list is a link to Previous Training Modules I found under a Support menu tab on the account’s web page.
Maybe more links to online training will show up next week when the local Tandem rep returns from Thanksgiving vacation and I can schedule a training?
I’m not sure I see the value add in Tandem’s pump simulation app since I already have the actual pump.
But I have installed the Tandem t:Connect program on both my (Win 10) desktop and on my phone. Of course, I still haven’t used t:Connect much beyond verifying it works since I’m still not doing anything with the pump yet. ",Nov '20

If you have T:Connect on phone, and you entered dexcom G6 transmitter id on pump, and do start sensor (on pump), I think you would be able to see readings after 2 hour warm-up.

Strange. I don’t think I’ve completed the setup for my X2 and it certainly doesn’t have an insulin cartridge in it, but it’s just been sitting quietly on my desk the past day or two and hasn’t given me any alerts at all.


I got a replacement pump today.  Absolutely nothing wrong with the old one.  My problem is with a junky G6 transmitter, but they decided to troubleshoot by replacing a perfectly good pump rather than the transmitter that hasn’t thrown an error code yet.  Doesn’t matter that my 3rd party app shows me it’s got a bad battery…
Anyway, you’re totally right.   I plugged it in earlier to charge up and walked away because I didn’t have time for the setup, and it hasn’t made a single peep all day even though it’s on.
It came with a little note explaining the software upgrade this new one came with, but didn’t mention anything about silencing persistent annoying alarms.

Thanks. I finally got around to giving this a try last night and so far it’s worked as I expected. The pump tracks the CGM results without bothering me with any (lack of) insulin alerts.
So I’m currently running a Dexcom G6 along with a Medtronic Guardian 3 sensor for my 630G pump. Not sure when I’ll get around to cutting over to using my t:slim X2 to pump insulin. Having a hard time syncing up with Tandem training.
Part of that is folks going on holiday vacation, of course.

It’s of more importance on their checklist than on mine. I’m running low on my 630G supplies so I expect I’m going to start using the Tandem to pump insulin sometime over the next two weeks regardless of what happens in terms of training.

a man weighing 60 kg and able to tolerate 100 g of carbohydrate might end up on 60 g of protein, 130 g of fat and 25 g of carbohydrate. His daily ration of the latter might consist of 7 oz (198 g) of thrice boiled cabbage, or 5 oz (142 g) of similarly treated spinach or two and a half bran biscuits [10]. The bran was needed to counteract the constipation induced by the rest of the diet.
Adults did relatively well on this regimen, but children hovered miserably between death from diabetes and death from starvation. One 12-year-old boy, already blind from diabetes, was reduced to eating toothpaste mixed with birdseed stolen from his pet canary. ‘These facts were obtained by confession after long and plausible denials’, remarked the pitiless Allen. The unfortunate child died of starvation. A few physicians hailed the treatment as a means of prolonging life, but Carl von Noorden shuddered and turned away when Joslin showed him one of his cases. The controversy concerning the value of extra months or years purchased at the cost of so much misery was very bitter, and Allen was banned from the diabetic clinic at the Rockefeller Institute in 1918 [11].

But if you’re sure it’s the pump there’s a simple solution: turn the pump’s CGM connection off and go manual like you ran on the Animas. You can still monitor your Dexcom readings with the Dexcom receiver or iphone / Apple watch / Android.

I’ve been on the t:slim X2 for almost two years now, and had been loving it… But I started noticing little glitches, and then started feeling like I wasn’t getting all my insulin.  I was constantly fighting highs, and in frustration resorted to doing syringe corrections/bonuses.  I found out that I responded normally to syringe injections, but not the pump, so it wasn’t just my needs changing.
I called Tandem customer service, and since the pump wasn’t throwing any error codes, I was told the next step was to meet with a CDE.  Since I live in a remote area, I just exchanged emails with the one they had contact me.  I wrote a small novel explaining exactly why I thought it was the pump, and they sent me a replacement overnight mail.
I’ve been using the new pump for a little bit over a month now, and everything is back to normal.
It’s a shame that this is your first experience with it, because the t: slim really is a great pump, but it is entirely possible that there is a technical issue with your pump.  It’s just not as likely as it being one of the above mentioned selections.
Also, I don’t think I’ve seen it mentioned yet, but you might need to adjust the DIA setting.  I think I’ve read around here before that previous ping users need a longer setting on the t:slim.
To prove it was my pump and not me, I had to show:

That I was responding differently to syringe injections with the same via of insulin than I was the pump.
That using s different infusion set didn’t make a difference.
That there wasn’t a drastic difference in control between the first day of an infusion set and the last.

And…
4.  I actually withdrew the remaining insulin in the cartridge after a set change, and found an extras 40 units of undelivered insulin.  (I use 45-55 u/day)
There is an expected 20 units of “dead space” in the cartridges that the pump can’t use, and you should ignore.  If the physical amount of insulin remaining in the cartridge exceeds 20u + the remaining insulin number in the top right corner of the screen, then that’s proof of non-delivered insulin.

I’m on novolog right now and my observation when giving correction boluses is that usually around the 20 minute mark, I should expect my BG to start coming down or turn the arrows from rising to steady.  My feeling is and I can’t quite put my finger on it, is that by the end of the first hour, the correction bolus has done all it can and doesn’t have any effectiveness like its done it’s job and out of my system already.  I can’t seeing it last for 4-5 hours.  If my correction bolus doesn’t do a thing within the first 30 minutes, I basically write it off and do another stronger correction.  While it seems I’m stacking insulin because my IOB increases, that insulin dose is not effective.
I’m not sure whether its insulin brand related, but this is what I’ve noticed on novolog.
So this brings me to think when people talk about the insulin tail, they seem to be referring the IOB at the end that still has some impact on the BG.

I think tail exists, but very small and not noticed.
If there are fats, proteins in meal, they usually take longer to digest, and do use up some insulin from bolus in the later hours.  Consider that those on low carb/high fat-protein, often bolus additional insulin to cover, using extended bolus.  Buts gets more confusing with IQ pumps also messing with basal at same time.",3d

For example, below is a graph of a one unit correction I took yesterday. I’ve had T1 for 46 years, and use Tresiba for basal.
You’ll see that I get almost nothing for the first 30 minutes, but activity getting into gear at one hour. But my BG continues to go down for a full five hours, though obviously the slope of the curve is highest for the first three hours.
I use Humalog. But I tried samples of Novolog, and found no discernable difference in speed or longevity, so I stayed with Humalog simply because it was easier not to switch. But if my insurer ever wants me to switch, I would have no issues with switching, because as far as I could tell, these insulins are virtually indistinguishable to me.

2279,The insulin tail,Diabetes Technology,Terry4,3,"The insulin tail does indeed exist but can be obscured by many other factors such as:


An insufficient basal dose that correction insulin must backfill before any effect on BG is noticed.


Other hormones like cortisol may be in play causing a temporary increase in insulin resistance and masking the effect of a correction dose.


Nutritional absorption of high carb plus high fat meals which can act many hours after the meal. High protein consumption can exhibit similar effects.


Diabetes glucose management is not simply about an insulin and glucose interaction. It is the dynamic interplay of insulin, food, other hormones, variable insulin sensitivity, variable and/or poor insulin absorption at infusion/injection sites, sleep deficiency caused insulin resistance, stress, exercise, hydration status and more.

I speak from painful experience that discounting the action of the seemingly insignificant action of the insulin tail can surprise and threaten your well-being at unexpected and random times.

So high sugar was more of an issue. I am still new at this under a year do my 20 lantus plus humalog sliding scale and one night I fell asleep no lantus checked sugar in the morning it was 105. Ok then the best plan I came up with is just don’t eat and surprisingly I had normal sugar all day until I had a sub sandwich about and quickly found myself at 285 ate all that bread. that was 7pm took the lantus early.
I am still curious if they would give me my normal insulin or the walmart kind I never took before.   I am not a paranoid person thinking police are out to get me but that situation at town hall came out of no place. Was not looking or expecting trouble. I kind of did not believe the friend I went with that the guy that fired him was such a jerk thought he was just mad about being fired.
I am not a paranoid person but I think it is worth thinking about having a plan in case of a false arrest.   For non diabetics its just a hassle, we could die.  I have no idea how I react to anything but lantus and humalog what if they stick me with something new and dictate the amount ??

Anyways, thing about low sugars which is why I don’t worry about them as much as high sugars is because they kind of don’t get worse most of the time. You eat just a little food to stabilize a low sugar. And they really won’t make you pass out unless you’re sleeping or you have taken way too much insulin and not eaten nearly enough. That’s just my opinion, but I worry about high sugars much more. Because they cannot go away. They will just get worse and worse automatically. I can walk around with a sugar of 30-50 and feel pretty ok, but I can’t do it with a sugar of 300-400. Anyways, just my opinion.
But no you are not being paranoid. It is a very real and serious concern. Also, for the situation you presented it doesn’t seem like you would be locked up for months, you most likely would be released. Problems occur with arrests when the person getting arrested makes it worse for himself, such as additional charges on top of the arrest. Resisting arrest assaulting a police officer. Then you have real problems. It’s also true that police officers will perceive someone with a serious low blood sugar reaction as someone who is intoxicated. And well then you might have problems too. That happened to me once. Bunch of cops made a circle around me and started throwing punches telling me to shut up and stay down.

Typically I would just wait it out. I mean I do know lawyers. I would never get taken upstate. But in that one case, it was a problem, I was throwing up, I was very sick. The guys in the cell thought I was dying. So the paramedics took me to the hospital where the hospital staff treated me. In actual prison though it would be different I’m sure.

You could call Tandem support and ask for samples of the steel sets.
I just switched to Tandem, and find the XC sites a bit itchy, compared to Medtronics.  But tolerable. I have tried both 6 and 9 mm, and 6 works better.
I think there is a spray or wipe that could be used as a barrier, but have not tried it.

I had something similar happened to me recently.  My stomach is fine but anywhere else like my buttocks, lower back, thighs (in particular), would swell up and turn red and start itching and become sore.  I would feel the cannula constantly (whereas on my tummy most of the time I don’t even know it’s there).    I did try the trusteel but it didn’t really make much of a difference (but no harm for you to try as you may have a different result) - but note that the trusteel has a suggested life of 2 days while the others are 3 days.  The only thing that made it slightly better was a few people suggested putting down a tape (like IV3000 or tegaderm) on your skin before putting on the cannula.  I find there is less irritation that way.   Now I can tolerate it on my lower back and buttocks… my thighs are still a no go zone and I have no idea why.",Oct '20

There is a 15-20 min delay after you inject insulin before it makes it to your blood. That’s not a delay in cgm. Your cgm is still only 5 min off even while you wait for your insulin to take effect.
But also know that the cgms build that delay into the system so the most current reading the second it comes up is actually 5 min old. That’s why you should be stable when calibrating. However since it calculates with that delay in mind it’s not that noticeable.

Thanks for explaining that.  For me, it’s clear that the insulin delay is a real thing.  Its not really a delay, it just takes 15-20 mins to kick in.  That in my mind is accounted for.

2331,Revised With New Information: The Dexcom G6 Transmitter Battery Replacement,Diabetes Technology,Fred_E,6,"I just successfully replaced my first Dexcom G6 transmitter battery (after about 160 days of use, extending the life using XDrip +).   I used this incredibly wonderful video…
Dexcom G6 Battery Replacement
I used an “Amazon Basics” brand CR1632 from Amazon which were NOT from shipped from an independent overseas 3rd party vendor.  They cost $3.50 a pair.   Many batteries that ship from these overseas vendors, although they are supposedly “name brand” such as “Maxell” etc are actually knockoffs and oft-times are DOA.  Thus, since Amazon warranties stuff that it makes, and has excellent quality control on their house-brand batteries, I chose the least-risky route and used their house brand of CR1632 battery rather than the “Maxell” or “Energizer” batteries shipped from overseas…
In the video, after successfully replacing the CR1632 battery  the instructor gives you the option of testing the battery by touching the 2 little “sensor contacts” with a cheap digital DC volt meter.   A successful replacement is indicated by the voltage reading about 2.3 millivolts (a very small amount).  This is the first test that you should do before applying the waterproofing glue.
I also devised a second test to make absolutely sure that the transmitter was working before applying the waterproofing glue.   As soon as I put the new CR1632 battery into the transmitter, I restarted my Samsung S7 Smartphone and continuously scanned for new Bluetooth devices.    The reason that I restarted my phone was to clear any previous Dexcom Bluetooth transmitter devices that may have been detected in the past.
The Bluetooth Low-Energy transmitter in the Dexcom G6 transmitter module transmits its “ID” (usually something like “Dexcom90”, “DexcomPQ” or “DexcomEY”)  every 5 minutes, even if it isn’t installed or “started”.   Thus, by using your cell phone to scan for 5 minutes (just press “scan” and repeat every few seconds till a new Dexcom device shows up in “Available Devices”), you can assure yourself that your Dexcom G6 transmitter is working, even before installing it…
As a result of this observed behavior, I conclude that the Dexcom G6 Transmitter module is using battery life even if it is not installed in a sensor and even if it has never been started or even installed.
Although the battery drain for an uninstalled transmitter is probably pretty low, it’s still doing an “announcement of its presence” every 5 minutes (which drains battery) and even when it’s not “announcing itself”, it is still running timer circuits etc and draining its battery.
The question is…   how long can you store these Dexcom G6 transmitters before use and not have a significant loss of transmitter battery life?
I guess that since Dexcom warranties the transmitter for 90 days AFTER its first use that this is not a real problem, if the battery dies during the first 90 days, just call Dexcom and ask for a replacement…
You should be aware though that the Dexcom G6 Transmitter is actually running and scanning for a Bluetooth partner every 5 minutes, even if it’s sitting unused in its original shipping box…",Aug '19

Here’s some new concepts…

Before removing your transmitter for battery replacement, always RESET IT…   The transmitter life in XDrip+ etc is NOT reset when you replace the battery.

In XDrip+ Android do the following right before you “Stop Sensor” in preparation for replacing the sensor and getting rid of the transmitter with the dead battery:
a) Hit the little Eyedropper icon on the right side of the XDrip+ main screen…   This will take you to the “units” screen.   Hit the little Microphone icon on the “units” screen and follow the prompts and speak the words “ENABLE ENGINEERING MODE” into your phone’s microphone.  Sometimes it’ll misinterpret what you’ve said and it’ll think that you said “and able engineering mode” or something.   Keep repeating these instructions till it understands you and says “Engineering Mode Enabled – Be Careful!” on the bottom of the XDrip+ main screen.
b) Once you’re in Engineering Mode, do the same thing as you did in step a), except say “HARD RESET TRANSMITTER”…
c) Then, go to the “System Status” XDrip+ screen and wait up till 15 minutes for the “Transmitter Days” to reset to 0…
d) If the “Transmitter Days” doesn’t reset to 0 in a maximum of 20 minutes, repeat the previous steps…
e) Once the “Transmitter Days” is successfully reset to 0, stop the sensor in XDrip+, remove the sensor/transmitter from your body, break the sensor in half, retrieve the transmitter, and replace the transmitter’s battery (no big rush on this since you’ve reset the “Transmitter Days” back to 0).

Here’s a great time-saver (it saves a big mess with waterproofing the transmitter with a bunch of glue…).

a)  If you haven’t broken any of the transmitter’s mounting tabs, you’ll notice that the exposed parts of the new battery are facing downwards and are not truly exposed to the elements.
b) Because of this, you really don’t have to cover the entire battery and transmitter case with that messy 2-part epoxy glue.
c) Insert the unglued transmitter into your new sensor.  Then, just put a thin coat of 1-part waterproof glue around the sides of the transmitter so that you’ve created a waterproofing shield between the inserted transmitter and the new sensor.
d)   Since you’re breaking the transmitter out of each used sensor, and reinserting the transmitter into a new sensor (and re-glueing the gap between the transmitter and the newly replaced sensor), the small coating of 1-part waterproof glue will serve you so that you can reuse the old transmitter indefinitely (by replacing the battery every 90 days or do).
e) This is much neater that coating the entire underside of the transmitter with that 2-part epoxy since it’ll make the worn-out battery’s much easier to replace over-and-over-again since you won’t have all that dried-up epoxy to scrape off…
f) I use this GE silicone rubber glue since it cleanly peels off when you remove the transmitter from the discarded old sensor and doesn’t damage the transmitter’s plastic like Gorilla Glue might.

Before removing your transmitter for battery replacement, always RESET IT… The transmitter life in XDrip+ etc is NOT reset when you replace the battery.


Sorry for bumping an old topic, but I had a few questions on replacing the batteries on old transmitters.  I have several old transmitters lying around (some 81XXXX and some 8GXXXX).  If I want to replace the battery on a transmitter, will it not work if the transmitter isn’t reset beforehand?
As far as I understand, it’s not possible to reset the 8GXXXX transmitters, but you can with the 81XXXX transmitters via Xdrip’s Engineering Mode->Hard Reset Transmitter command.  My 81XXXX transmitters were used until the batteries failed them and have since sat unused for months, so I don’t really have a way to perform a hard reset before replacing the battery.  My 8GXXXX transmitters were used for ~100 days until Xdrip gave me errors, but there should be some battery life yet in those transmitters.",Jun '20

2351,Possibly Diabetic? Would like insight!,Type 2,ferrarifan0811,,"Hi All,
I am a 29 year old caucasian male, who for the last ~10 years has been slowly making my towards the higher end of the “overweight” range of a BMI chart.
Went for an annual physical today, had a slightly elevated BP (132/88), and bloodwork from two weeks prior gave me a FBG of 108. Historically I’ve hovered around 100- once or twice a little over, but usually under. Everything else- cholesterol, triglycerides, etc, are not even close to being out of spec.
My (new) doctor, for the sake of being thorough, gave me an A1C test and it came back as 6.5%- I’ve never taken this test before.
This surprised me given the FBG would indicate i’m not diabetic. I’ve also been dieting (~1600 calories per day, high fiber and protein, lower carbs, gov’t-recommended levels of fat) since July and have lost ~15 pounds thus far, down from 220. Most of this weight loss was from July through September, and since then I’ve sort of regressed but haven’t added any weight back on.
Due to COVID though I’m not super active- I run 2-3 miles once a week and haven’t been able to do much weight training since the gym is closed.
It seems to me like more testing needs to be done, but… what do you guys think? I do have some history of Type II in my family, and my diet hadn’t been ideal prior to my new diet/weight loss (higher fats and carbs, drink alcohol fairly frequently, etc), and I may have some sleep apnea issues (unsure how frequent this happens, may only be if I drink in the evening). Other than that though, I’m genuinely surprised and don’t see a clear reason why I’d suddenly develop diabetes.
I’d like to know what you guys think. Should I continue to diet and just do another A1C in ~4 months (which is what my doctor recommended)? Should I buy an at-home monitor and see what’s going on here? Open to opinions!",Nov '20

Welcome to our community!!!
Yes, absolutely.  Buy yourself a Contour Next meter and some test strips and start testing before you meals, 1 hour after meal and 2 hours after meal and keep a good record.  You will quickly start to learn what is driving your blood sugar up and what to avoid for food/drink.  If you plan to fix your issue with little to no medications, it will be tough to do on your own given your weight.

2356,Is “gluten-free” another fad diet or is there something to it?,Community,jlp515,1,"Lately I have heard a lot about a gluten free diet being referred to as the ""next fad diet"" (which kinda aggravates me). It may be a fad for some, but for many of us, it is a necessary way of life.To start, the wheat we are eating nowadays is far different than it used to be.The strains have been crossbred over the years leading to a wheat that has 50% more gluten than its counterparts!To top it off, for most of us, our bodies are not meant to be able to digest this much gluten. Therefore, if your body is sensitive to it, even a small amount could be detrimental to your health.I know a lot of you have discovered you have some degree of intolerance to wheat, whether it’s a sensitivity or a true allergy. I have as well, and I think it’s at least worth looking into if you've been experiencing some of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity.(see below)So what is gluten? It’s a protein found in products containing wheat. It is estimated that celiac disease (a gluten allergy) affects between 0.7% and 1% of the population. However, it’s estimated that up to 1 in 20 people in the US could have NCGS (Non celiac gluten sensitivity). It’s difficult to estimate the exact prevalence of NCGS because there is no definitive test for it. One way to find out if you’re sensitive to gluten is to remove it from your diet for a couple weeks and monitor your symptoms to see if they improve.If you have NCGS you have trouble absorbing essential nutrients from food. In fact, gluten could be damaging the lining of your intestine causing leaky gut syndrome and also causing an imbalance in your gut flora (the important bacteria that regulates your immune system).Leaky gut is something we don’t hear about often (not sure why) but it can be very dangerous to your health. It can cause inflammation which can lead to chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes as well as autoimmune diseases. In fact, more and more research is showing a strong link between type 1 diabetes and celiac disease and some doctors are even testing for this upon diagnosis(good idea).Americans have increased their wheat intake over the years (because we've been told it’s healthy for us), but each of us should still evaluate whether or not the recommended nutrition guidelines are working for us. It takes some experimentation and time, (believe me, I know I am still experimenting) to find out how your body reacts to different foods, but it’s worth it in the long run.I’m definitely not an expert in this area, just stumbled upon all of this a few years ago for personal reasons, but the more I learn the more fascinated I am. I think it is definitely something that is not talked about nearly enough in the healthcare field but needs to be. It’s really amazing how important food is to our heath.JodiFor a list of symptoms of NCGS visit this website:  • http://www.celiaccentral.org/non-celiac-gluten-sensitivity/ 1References: • http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-kresser/gluten-intolerance_b_2964812.html

Referring to the interval between 4am and 9am, its hovering around 4.8mmol (86.4mg) which I think is good.  And its a relatively flat line.  But you see that Basal IQ kicks for a very short duration but frequently.  The duration it kicks in for is literally one data point, I’m not sure it will make a difference if it didn’t kick in to be honest.  At this time, its fluctuating up and down between 4.6mmol (82mg) to 4.8 mmol (86mg) which is nothing.
I should also add, the previous night it was hovering around 6mmol (108mg) and again a relatively flat line and basal IQ didn’t kick in at all.

2361,Basal IQ frequently kicking in,Diabetes Technology,John_S2,1,"@tedos:
While I don’t have any inside knowledge as to the actual algorithm used to prevent lows with B-IQ, I think that I know enough about control systems to try to explain what I suspect is going on.
While my analogy is not perfect, let me use the example of you following a truck going down a long hill. I use a truck because it takes a long time to slow or stop just as falling blood sugar takes a long time to react to reductions in basal insulin.
On a steep downhill what do you see when you are following a truck? The brake lights come on quickly and stay on. You can tell that the driver is applying moderate to heavy braking force because, after a while, you can smell his brakes. This is the equivalent to rapidly falling glucose levels: B-IQ significantly reduces or even stops basal insulin for an extended period of time as soon as it determines that your blood sugar is falling rapidly. It keeps that basal insulin significantly slowed or stopped until it begins to see that your dropping glucose levels have begun to flatten out … which could be a period of an hour or more.
What happens when the same truck is going down a shallower hill … one where the truck speed is barely increasing. What do you see this time?  You are likely see the driver coast for a bit, then apply the brakes briefly and lightly, coast a bit more, reapply the brakes briefly, etc.
I think that what you are observing is that the driver in charge of Basal-IQ is “tapping the brakes” periodically to keep your very gradually dropping, nearly flat blood sugar from “picking up speed” and dropping too fast.
To me, this behavior seems perfectly reasonable.
Stay safe!
John",Nov '20
2362,Basal IQ frequently kicking in,Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,1,"@John_S2 gave a great analogy.  Except with Basal-IQ, the truck can’t slow down, it can only do hard stops, though sometimes only briefly.  So you’ve got to follow that “truck” a lot more carefully, because it’s going to come to a complete stand still on the highway.  His analogy better lines up with the Control-IQ algorithm, which can indeed slow down and tap the brakes.
Basal-IQ completely shuts off any basal when Dexcom predicts you’ll be less than 3.9 mmol in the next 30 minutes.  This is a great thing, but also a bit of a weaknesses in the system if your BG is falling rapidly, just generally erratic (dehydrated, dying sensor, etc…), or you’re trying to intentionally lower BG pre-meal.  It also resumes insulin the moment your BG changes direction, which may be too soon if you’re very low.
Basal-IQ was an incredible first generation product for preventing lows, but Control-IQ far surpasses it.  Hopefully it gets cleared in Australia soon!  Tandem has stated it should be available world-wide in early 2021.  I’ve been nearly a year removed from Basal-IQ, so I’ve forgotten those weak points.
There are two different schools of thought on pump automation.  Those who think it’s a tool to be used to maximum benefit and love to see it working, and those who think it’s a tool to be used to make settings adjustments and try to avoid pump intervention.  I’m definitely in the former category.  To me, that graph looks beautiful and like Control-IQ was behaving perfectly to avoid lows throughout the night, while still maintaining a flat graph near the lower range limit.
However, I’ve gotten the impression that you might be in the latter category and looking to avoid Basal-IQ having to kick in.  That’s perfectly alright, too.  If you want to avoid Basal-IQ kicking in, you need to reduce your basal, though probably only SLIGHTLY.  The trade-off is that you’ll run a little higher at night, but you’ve got some range to spare.
I know you’ve gotten plenty of advice about adjusting correction factor (maybe even from me!), but we’ve all forgotten that correction factor doesn’t play a role at all with Basal-IQ… while being CRITICAL to Control-IQ.  It’s completely irrelevant to you right now.  The only adjustments you can make are basal rate and drinking lots of water to help your Dexcom data out.",Nov '20
2363,Basal IQ frequently kicking in,Diabetes Technology,John_S2,2,"As usual, @Robyn_H is exactly correct about the differences between C-IQ and B-IQ and their ability to “dial back” vs completely stop basal for a short time, respectively. Even with Basal-IQ, if basal is completely off for 5 minutes and then back on for the next 15, given the 20-30 minute “activation” time of Humalog or Novolog, to your body that probably looks very similar to “dialing back” basal to approximately 75% … even though it was achieved with completely digital on/off pulses of basal.
And @Robyn_H is absolutely correct: B-IQ was a great first step and C-IQ is so much better. I can hardly wait to see “Daughter of C-IQ” or whatever the next version will be called.

While my analogy is not perfect, let me use the example of you following a truck going down a long hill.


Thanks for explaining that.  I’ll probably watch it a few more times and see whether it’s consistently kicking in- at the moment it’s not, when my BG is along the borderline of my low range, it will kick in but when my BG is slightly away from the borderline low, it doesn’t kick in.

 Robyn_H:

Ah yes, I’m not really sure what to expect.  This CGMS experience has made me think a bit differently about my control and the possibilities of what I can do with it and I’m not too sure which of the two camp i want to be in yet.
You are right, at the moment I’m in the latter one.  In my head, I want to establish a “normal” baseline first rather than relying on the brains in the pump to steer me in the right direction.  The more accurate I can get it means the brains will have less to do but thinking about this it doesn’t really matter because the technology is there and I’m never going to get my BG spot on because I know too well it’s going to change over time so why not just rely on the technology .
I think my bad experience with Medtronic cgms  has made me a bit wary about relying on pump technologies.  I am not yet confident  it can be accurate and reliable.  Dexcom is changing my thinking and I think I just need a bit more convincing.",Nov '20

I think in Australia they are forcing you to get this done via the DE for every upgrade.  I couldn’t get the basal iq update unless I got my DE to sign the form.  So you have to make an appointment and pay for the consult in order to get it.  This is a pain for every upgrade in my opinion.  DEs can be useful but only to a certain point.

I wonder if the wait is on Tandem’s end?  When Basal-IQ got the FDA approval here, the software was made available immediately through Tandem’s patient portal.  We just had to log in and submit a request, and as soon as Tandem got the prescription back from the doctor we could download the software update.
Control-IQ was very different, though.  After the FDA approval, we waited weeks for them to actually make the software available to anyone.  And even at that, it was a very slow rollout.  They were trying to get people to wait until they got an email invitation to start the prescription request and online training process.  Those of us who  read online knew it was available and jumped the gun, though.  I have no idea why it took so much more time to implement than Basal-IQ, but you might still be in that intermediary phase.
Maybe logon to the patient portal and see what’s available for you, there? I’m post a link to the portal I know, but I don’t know if australian users have a different website.

The first year I woke up to a 115 in the morning, (I had a meter I would test off and on because of an uncle that had type 1) that year I had a cold at the beginning of the year, a few months later a dog had died, and then a few months later my mom died…I have always thought stress helped set it off, but I also had a cold at the beginning of the year.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been doubling every 20 years. In Finland, the recommendation for daily vitamin D supplementation was gradually reduced from 4000-5000 IU in 1964 to 400 IU in 1992. Concomitantly, T1D increased by 350% in those aged 1-4 years, 100% in those aged 5-9 years, and 50% in those aged 10-14 years [1]. However, since 2006, T1D has plateaued and decreased after an increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) after the authorities’ decision to fortify all dietary milk products with cholecalciferol [2]. Moreover, the worldwide association of ultraviolet (UV)-B light and vitamin D status with T1D and multiple sclerosis is now more than evident.

It is well known that viruses can play a role in type 1 and other autoimmune diseases. EBV  is linked to multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes & celiac as well as several cancers, mostly lymphomas. It is thought the virus turns on risk genes for various autoimmune diseases. A few months before my dka I was sick and went to doc, they tested me for lupus and a bunch of other stuff but not D.

As an idea, the flu relationship could be the other way around, in that a weakened immune state of impending T1 you are more likely to get the flu, or succumb to other mental or physical problems, or the the flu can be the proverbial ‘last straw’, not causing, but accelerating beta-cell decline.
The most recent autoimmune trigger I have read about is enterovirius, and I have long read about milk proteins - before my diagnosis, I was drinking up to a gallon a day - or even lowered helicobacter pylori infection rates - fighting it off could protect us against the autoantibody response - as well as a microbiome relationship.

Imagine this: your immune system has been killing off your beta cells for the past years but you’ve been barely getting along with the reduced insulin production.
Then all of a sudden you get the flu and you now need twice as much insulin. And your pancreas cannot keep up at all. Whatever beta cells are left are pushed to their limit and beyond. Shortly afterwards (weeks) you in DKA and the doc in the ER puts you on insulin.
My theory is not that the flu caused an immune reaction that killed your beta cells and caused diabetes. My theory is that your body had been killing off beta cells for the past year, it’s just the flu brought it to the surface where it was easily diagnosed as DKA following the flu.",Dec '20

Diabetics who live in states that are hard on syringe access can expect problems. In places like Minnesota, where pharmacists are required to supply (even drug addicts) with some syringes, they can get by a little easier.
But, the opioid epidemic has effects on people with valid prescriptions and insurance, too. Patients aren’t permitted physical possession of their prescriptions. Thats because people were forging Rx’s like crazy to gain access to opioids. That makes things more difficult for diabetics. Patients may never get to see their Rx’s or their expiration dates.

2408,T1D with no insurance?,Community,DrBBType 1 or LADA,2,"As background for what you’re looking at, a couple of things that are frequently misunderstood:


“Insulin” isn’t just one thing. There are multiple formulations with different durations and effect curves. You have to know a lot about how your own body works (insulin-carb ratio, correction ratio, other stuff) as well as how the insulin you’re taking works in order to use it safely.


“Walmart insulin”: basically the stuff those of us diagnosed back in the 80s to late-90s were on, and it is a very different beast to the analog insulins developed since then. Harder to predict effect times, thus more likely to cause dangerous lows (I speak from 20 yrs experience). It can keep you alive, so yay, but it isn’t like swapping in the generic OTC version of Tylenol or whatever. You have to organize your life around it.


“Diabetic coma”: this pseudo-medical term drives me nuts because I don’t know what the person means by it, especially when used by reporters or other non-diabetics. Are they referring to Diabetic Keto-Acidosis (DKA), which results from lack of insulin, or hypoglycemic unconsciousness—what is usually portrayed in TV episodes—which can result from taking insulin? In the case of rationing scenarios, DKA would be the presumptive interpretation, but not always, because allowing yourself to run “high” to save money but not so high as to kill yourself is not a straight-line thing, like adjusting a thermostat. We call it the roller-coaster phenomenon, when trying to control peaks can result in deep valleys, especially if you’re trying to use something you’re not familiar with like the Walmart stuff.


Hoarding: ALL T1s hoard, or if they don’t, they should. Applies to all supplies but insulin most of all. Because guess what: if you run out, you can die. You’re always aware of it, even if not immediately threatened by loss of insurance coverage. That’s why it’s humorously referred to as the “zombie apocalypse” stash: “because you never know…”  It becomes almost neurotically hard to throw stuff away—kind of a perennial topic on these forums actually. So even if we’re not rationing, we’re all living under that shadow to a greater or lesser extent.


You could do worse than to search “rationing” on this and other diabetic forums to see how we discuss the issue and the media reports around it. There’s a lot of sympathy, because “there but for the grace of god,” but also an oddly judgmental strain in some of the comments you see. I think that’s defensive in a way: reassuring ourselves that WE’D know what to do even if those other poor saps couldn’t figure it out.",9d

There are many with insurance that still don’t get good care, for various reasons, lack of insurance is just one situation that impacts ability to get care.

I'd even had to give my twins breathing treatments before.Fast forward to now. It's been almost 6 months since we started using oils, and not one of us have been on an antibiotic or anything OTC.

If anyone else uses them and wants to share success stories, I'd love to hear them - it makes my heart happy to hear how well they work in other people's lives, too!!!

2420,Essential Oils - I was a skeptic until,Diabetes Advocacy,HolgerType 1 or LADA,,"Many oils have very positive side effects. Especially those very rich in omega 3 like fish oil and linseed oil. Here is an interesting talk about mental health and nutrition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dqXHHCc5lA 12. The implications of this talk are quite dramatic.
These oils are recommendable for many inflammatory issues like stomach and bowel conditions. T1 is an autoimmune condition and as such T1 diabetics are very prone to these problems. After finding out that I am lactose intolerant it was the treatment with encymatic helpers for the lactose, fish oil and lineseed oil daily that helped to calm down my bowel again. One very interesting side effect of linseed oil is its positive effect on arteries called atherosclerotic plaque regression.
Like Shannon I highly recommend to experiment with these oils. Like her I can also see the positive effect on post meal spikes (if the oils are taken with the meal).",Jan '16

My husband’s aunt is involved with YoungLiving.  She sent me a starter kit recently.
My son has allergies, not with asthma but sneezing, sniffles, etc.  We’ve been using the essential oils and they are working too.
I use a couple of different blends in my diffuser to help me sleep. I’m 33 weeks pregnant with my 4th and final kiddo.  I have trouble sleeping at this phase of my pregnancy.  The only other time I’ve used them is during labor/delievery. I bring them to the hospital and some of the nurses think i’m nuts but they really help me focus and concentrate through the contractions and pain.  I don’t use pain meds at all.
I also get somewhat sick during labor and Orange scent curbs my urge to purge.
I haven’t tried them on myself yet.  I will since you have found success though.

I follow low carb, but during a recent ultrasound of my kidneys, bladder and surrounding areas the technician assured me I was not pregnant.  Just teasing you as I am male.  What happens to me at this time of year for a few weeks is exactly what you mention going from average 80’s to fluctuating up to even 170.  I live in the North East US and twice a year when the temperature changes from hot to cold or cold to hot I get this phenomenon.  This may have nothing to do with your particular case, but just something to think about as our symptoms are identical although they may be caused by very different factors.",Oct '20
2426,8 weeks and sugars flying!,Diabetes and Pregnancy,allisonm,,"Hi Jennifer - I have three suggestions. Since you didn’t mention whether you have reassessed your insulin dosing - I would say that sometimes in pregnancy, you have to change your basals, carb ratios and/or insulin sensitivity every few days! Around 8 weeks you may expect, generally, to need less insulin across the board through about 16-20 weeks. But everyone is different - if you find yourself going high after meals rather than low, perhaps you will need more insulin for now.
Another suggestion I have is to be sure you are dosing properly for fat/protein since you are low carb. What can compound this issue during pregnancy is that your digestion is slowed to ensure your body gets as many nutrients as it can to baby! So if you are going high well after a meal… perhaps you just need to be doing something like an extended bolus that is more generous to cover that fat and protein.
I would also say that, when you have such a tight BG target, it is tempting to overcorrect all the time. This can also cause a roller coaster effect when you are constantly over dosing for a high BG and then over eating to treat a low. Try to be gentler with your corrections if you believe you are experiencing this.
I wasn’t low carb in pregnancy, but I know many mamas have successful, healthy pregnancies while doing so.

Today my blood sugars are back down… they are dropping low more often also as well as roller coasteering.
Prior to the pregnancy, I thought I perfected my hypo treatments and would get the lows back to 85. Now i am eating the same amount and staying low but bouncing high after around 35 minutes when I used to come up 15 minutes later. It has to do with the digestion.
Not sure what else to change at this point since I am going both high and low. Hard to keep a steady line on the dex. If you have any other recommendations please let me know!!",Oct '20

When there is signal loss between transmitter & phone, the application will show a lack of dots.

Easy to Install and Run Xdrip. Step Instructions Type 1 and LADA


    Have heard people mention Xdrip a lot.  Someone here said, “Compared to Xdrip, the Dexcom app is a toy”.  Wouldn’t go that far but I expect to switch to the Xdrip app permanently.  A HUGE benefit, I think, as you can extend the life of your sensors and tranmitter without restarting sensors or changing battery in tranmitter (which I have never tried). This is true for the G5, but not sure about the G6. 
I am up and running on Xdrip as of today, Much easier than I thought. Anyone should be able to…

Friday my sensor kept giving me errors and all the beeping is really annoying to me and my friends. So I decided to replace the sensor with the spare I brought.
After placing the sensor I pressed start new sensor like I always do. 5 minutes in again sensor error ugh. 15 minutes later the error went to sensor failure.
I freaked out at that point no pharmacy nearby and no extra sensor back to poking fingerpricks. So I removed the sensor like always slowly and carefully but no wire to be found I double checked the sensor and I even opened up the applicator to see if it got stuck in there. But no no wire to be found.
My arm did hurt and I had the feeling that the wire was under my skin. I came home Sunday night and I directly placed an sensor on. Called dexcom and they are shipping 2 new sensors but about the missing wire they didn’t seem to be to concerned. On Monday morning I called my doctor and explained to her the situation and I was able to come in and get X-rays taken I asked the radiologist if I could see the pictures I seen that there was something there so the doctor came in and said she didn’t see anything. I questioned her answer by I think I seen something on the X-rays so she tried to open it up on her laptop but the program wasn’t working so we walked to the big screen TV and I asked her what that hairline was and she said that it was a scratch on the X-ray so I asked her to open the second picture and there was the hairline again but from an other angle she said it is 1 inch long and that can’t be it. I pulled up an x-ray picture of the g5 wire up from Google and it was the same thing. She was stunned by the results and was wondering why it’s on the inside of my arm. THE SENSOR WIRE MIGRATED. Now I need to get an urgent surgery on Thursday to get it removed before it migrating to other places in my body (heart lungs brain ect.
I called dexcom to report this issue and they are making up a medical report and someone is going to call me back to let me know how to go further.
I have insurance but I already paid 30$ copay for this visit and Thursday I have to pay another 40 dollars for the surgery. I hope dexcom is reimburse me for this inconvenience. But I doubt that I even wonder if it will be reported to the FDA.

Could be correct of course, IANAL, but my thought is that the insurer would be the entity making the case for reimbursement not the patient. At least that’s how it has been for me when I’ve been injured due to another party’s negligence (both auto accidents where the other person was 100% at fault). I never had to be involved; it was all the insurance companies talking to each other. Of course this isn’t an auto accident, but it’s also pretty worrying for Dexcom from a marketing/PR standpoint (not to mention medical).

2477,Type 1 father always worried,Type 1 and LADA,David7,,"Hi everyone,
I was diagnosed type 1 at 26 while in grad school. Got married 6 years ago and we have an almost 4 years old daughter. We breasted exclusively for 6 months as we read it helps with lowering the probability.
Anyways, I started random checks on our daughter when she was one. I must admit I am paranoid about her becoming diabetic. I feel like I would not forgive myself. So here are my questions.


I never really see numbers above 125 and that’s good but I also never see numbers below 95. I check in the morning before food and she is always 98 to 110. Do kids have different glucose levels than adults? It bothers me that I never see an 80 numbers but I read somewhere that kids eat all the time and that their numbers should be higher.


I contacted trialnet. They are pushing for us to take her and have her tested. My wife is against it as she said that there is nothing we will gain from knowing other than worry and not let our daughter enjoy life every day. Obviously I would like to have her tested. Any views on trialnet would be highly appreciated.


How do any of you just relax ? Seriously I go through periods where is don’t think about it and then i go through period when it monopolises my mind.


Sorry I know I sound paranoid. Just nowhere else to turn and talk to. Think I have exhausted the discussion with my wife
Thank you",Oct '20
2478,Type 1 father always worried,Type 1 and LADA,Jay6,1,"@David7.   WOW!   First things first.   WELCOME, your load is heavy.  Let me share what I do and don’t know.
Comments to your points:
Point 1.  Children are not tiny adults.  Their bodies operate in a different orbit.  Your observations are good & I hope you have them documented including meals, activity & wellness, so the environment the number was from is clear.   Research glucose normal values for children, including consideration of the site:  forum.jdrf.org 3  which looks at type one across the lifespan.
Point 2.  I was unaware of trialnet.  A quick read gave me the idea you may be on a good course.  However, remember you want the BEST course, not necessarily the GOOD or BETTER course.  Not chatting with you and your spouse, I would not jump into your marital bliss.  I am not a trained councilor or one to give this type of advice.
Point 3.  If I tell you to stop thinking about the elephant in the living room, how do you stop thinking about the elephant?  Relax is a hard thing to do.  How about shifting your focus.  A normal A1c is below 5.7, where is yours?  How well are you managing?  Research has shown the better one’s A1c, the lower the risk of complications.  Can you focus on yourself a little more?  What does your bride believe?  What train would she be willing to join you on in this family life quest?  On first read, I would not call your response paranoid, you are doing what a man is hardwired to do, look out for family.  I read a hormonal study indicating women look for providers and protectors, while men have hormonal hard wiring to find the woman to birth children & rear them.
POINT 4.  The unsaid item in your post is a “cost to benefit analysis” of all of the options on the table.
(1) What does your family’s health care team say when you bring ‘trialnet’ up?
(2) What is the projected cost of ‘trialnet’? Travel? Lodging? COVID exposure? Work disruption? Stress on daughter & wife? and many more.
(3) How will the family use the findings?   Positive reaction & plan?   Negative reaction & plan?  Marital harmony impact either way?

2479,Type 1 father always worried,Type 1 and LADA,ChrisP,1,"I have a 8 and 10 year old and I worry about this too. I got type one at 35 (2 years ago).
My understanding is the average person has a 1/300 chance of developing type 1. If your father has it you have a 1/20 chance. I don’t remember where I read that so feel free to challenge that ratio.
Probably 3-4 times a year I to a blood sugar check just to see if they ever have an unexpected high sugar. So far I don’t think I’ve seen anything above ~135.
I have 2 things I’m doing for them.


Know the signs of type 1 and pay attention to them so you can catch it early. (Thirst, weight loss, low energy etc…)


I give them both 2000 UI vitamin D per-day


There are at least on going trials to study if Vitamin D reduces the chance of developing type 1 so we don’t know yet.

Its considered a safe thing to take
It’s believed to help with COVID and other types of infections

I have thought about doing the trials.net 2 but I know my girls would not want to do the blood test so I’m not making them. It won’t change anything just maybe provide an early warning.
I feel confident that if they develop type 1 I’ll know well before they reach DKA since its always top of mind and I can check their blood sugar anytime I’m concerned.

2480,Type 1 father always worried,Type 1 and LADA,Terry4,1,"One thing you don’t appear to factor into your consideration of TrialNet participation. If a child of a T1D parent starts to show antibodies indicative of T1D, the family can participate in studies designed to slow down the progression of the disease. Sometimes this may translate to a delay of the full onset for years, prolonging the time of natural insulin production.
At your daughter’s young age, she need not be burdened with the knowledge of testing positive for the antibodies but if she does come up negative for the antibodies, you and your family can be relieved of this nagging concern.
Type 1 diabetes represents a real threat to the growing percentage of children who must respond to its life changing consequence. TrialNet is an effort to better understand how this disease works and your family’s participation would contribute to that goal.

He definitely does not blame me for them, and blaming myself makes no sense to me. What good would that do?
Your child is going to pick up on your fears, and that will do her no good whatsoever.
I wish you could just let her be and not keep testing her blood. If she starts showing any signs of diabetes, you will recognize them right away and you can seek help then.
Have you considered getting some counseling to help you control your fear? All of this worry is not doing you any good and it certainly isn’t helping your daughter at all. Your daughter could eventually be dx with diabetes, and if she is you and she will deal with it. It certainly isn’t the end of the world.

A far better approach woudl be to enroll your child in trial net.  Not only will their participation help you know that your child is not spiraling toward diabetes, but that in some cases there might be things to be done to forestall onset.

Her doctors told us she has no issues right now and looks like she probably won’t.
It really is a relief to get them tested.
And also there are some meds that can slow or prevent the progression of t1, so knowing is better than not knowing.
My daughter was tested 14 years ago, I bet the tests are better now.
Besides that if it helps you to know, a type 1 person has Just  less than a 1 percent chance of having a type 1 kid.
A non diabetic couple has a 0.75 percent chance so really it’s not that different.

It’s such a crapshoot, this condition. We don’t know what can trigger it. We supplemented with Vitamin D, breastfed…but still. At one point, the anxiety of her getting it really did consume my life.

2491,Type 1 father always worried,Type 1 and LADA,Sally7,1,"I wish I could give you an answer but these are very personal questions with very personal answers.
Blood sugar numbers can only be used for each individual person. My numbers are completely different than the next persons. Neither is good or bad but personal.
TrialNet is very personal. I never wanted children because I didn’t want my children to have to deal with this nightmarish disease. But we did end up having tow beautiful children. And here is my very personal opinion. The treatment plans now vs 50 years ago are light years apart. I mean my pump system allows me to almost completely stop thinking about my diabetes. There is so much available now to make diabetes much more manageable. And as to testing? Both my kids were part of TrailNet a long time ago. Our thinking was, if we can help make things better for others why not?! And my worst fear my daughter tested positive on the first test. Thankfully she didn’t qualify to continue and it has been over 20 years and still ok. But my thinking now, she is an incredibly smart woman who could handle anything thrown at her. Kinda like my parents and I did way back in the day.
Only you can decide what to do and how to do it. I am a big fan of clinical trials. I use to whine and complain about the fact there was no cure that was promised from day one. Reality in my mind, can only find a cure if people are willing to sign up for trials. And while most are for making the day to day stuff easier. I have done stem cell studies and of course my children for TrialNet. But again, very personal.

2492,Type 1 father always worried,Type 1 and LADA,gadgetfreak,1,"Hello, like you I was diagnosed older I was 22 living in Boston having the time of my life. I didn’t know what diabetes was when I was hospitalized. Now it’s been awhile I’m 47 now but when I went to the Joslin I thought they told us 1 T1d parent the kid has a 5% chance and with both parents it goes to 10%. Please don’t rip me apart it’s been awhile but that’s always stuck with me. They also told us it usually skips a generation, no sure on that.
All I can say is when my son was younger he was normal weight then in high school he played football and blew up too 280 by 16. Obviously for his height of 5’11 that’s to much and he didn’t feel good about himself and literally to this day works out extremely hard. His weight now is 157lbs and he is 21 and healthy healthy.
I never thought about it I guess, pretty ignorant of me I just never thought the chances were high his pancreas and immune system would have the same issue, it’s different than type 2. I can almost remember signs of me going low as a teenager and my eye sight going blurry but would drink so much Mountain Dew it probably fixed the low, who knows.
I don’t even know how any of this relates scientifically but I’m not one or a doctor just a father that let his kid live without putting fears in his head. even when he was obese I never thought of him getting type 1, I would say lay off the soda it’s not good at the rate your drinking it and thought of type 2 when he got older but he is a health conscience adult now, also when he stopped drinking diet soda, that’s only soda  we had at the time he lost 30lbs.
I would just say do what your doing, teach healthy eating, don’t buy processed crap food and implement exercise or some kind of sports, just get the body moving.
This is a tough one and I won’t lie and say you didn’t have me thinking guilty thoughts of what if something happens, I never even thought of that seriously and he was a planned child. Best of everything to your family, my advice is just live life unless you see or they feel something that looks concerning.
I see your point with the testing but if your symptoms were anything like mine they came on fast and feverishly, I went from fine one day to drinking 3 gallons of water and peeing every 5 minutes, ya’ll know how it is. I’m sure all the testing in the world can tell you some good chances but we have no control over something like this, I mean real control like I’m not going to touch the hot oven control. We have resources to help but like so many others have said a real crap shoot. That stress cannot be good for you. Best of everything to you and the family

2494,Type 1 father always worried,Type 1 and LADA,Dessito,,"Very interesting discussion. I was diagnosed with T1 also in graduate school when I was in my late 20s, with no known family member who ever had the disease.
Now I have a three-year-old and before I got pregnant we researched a lot about the probabilities of a child of a T1 parent to also be diabetic. As others have said above, it is for some (yet unclear reason) higher if the father has the condition, which might explain your heightened worry. I worry too for my child, but not on a daily basis and more as part of all the general “what does life hold for this little being who is my heart”? So I think to your third question – there is no way to completely remove the thought/worry, but I assure you that even if diabetes was not a factor in your family, any number of other things would have worried you the same way. It is simply a part of being a parent, and probably for the better in the grand scheme of things. But your job as a parent means you also don’t want it to become paralyzing for you or a burden for your child. I know, easier said than done.
On TrialNet – I am a big believer in participating in research in general for the sake of expanding knowledge (and took part in a clinical study of a medicine supposed to preserve beta-cell function in newly diagnosed T1s when my condition first presented which was an amazing educational experience), so actually signed up my child soon after she was born even though she had to be 2.5 to even qualify for the screening. Yet, I still have the packet and have not actually gone for her blood draw for it. (Obviously the current COVID conditions are part of what made this a lower priority.) I do go back and forth myself (my spouse is fine with whatever choice I make) and some part of me wonders whether it should be a choice she makes herself when she is older. I might still go with that approach, since in general as a parent I try to respect her as an individual and give her the appropriate level of autonomy. In all honesty, I am also not sure that I am mentally prepared for a result where she tests positive for the anti-bodies. But for some people knowing might be more comforting…
FWIW, I have also never tested my child’s BG. I do believe that I am well aware of the signs and that I will catch any that she might start exhibiting while young. (And there has been more than a single time when I have wondered “is she drinking a lot of water today?”)
So probably my answer contains nothing particularly helpful to you, but I do want to thank you for starting this thread where we can read the experiences of T1s with grown children. It is always useful to get that kind of perspective.",Dec '20

Still her labs are always normal.

I really want Tidy bowl to come up with a reactive color, so when you see it go from blue to say, purple, you know there’s a problem.

I somewhat guiltily realize that I should have her tested again. I can’t remember what the age is, but there’s an age at which, if you haven’t shown autoantibodies, then it’s unlikely you ever will.
My understanding is that there are actions you can take that either decrease the likelihood of your child every developing diabetes or delaying their getting it.  I had an endocrinologist who I liked a lot who firmly believed that you could stop or delay the development of diabetes if you had the antibodies but had not developed the disease. I’m in no position to evaluate whether that’s true – he was a good endocrinologist but he might have been wrong about that – but it certainly seems worth trying to me.
In fact, I now realize that I should get my daughter tested again.  I haven’t because I liked the first result and didn’t want to think about it but closing one’s eyes to something is probably never a good idea.  (I should know, I do it a lot!)",Dec '20

SSRI


A Meta Study from 2017 examined this.  I was just rereading it.  The Meta Analysis did show some positive correlation.  However, as of 2017 and later ones I recall looking at have not found causation.  Remember association is not causation.  For instance are people using SSRI’s have more blood work?  If so then it is possible diabetes is a condition discovered because the patient is using SSRI’s.  Here is anther factor do people who feel badly seek the use of these mediations?  Do they perhaps feel bad because they are or could be PWDs?  I cannot put much alarm in the findings that just cannot show causation.
This is the full conclusion statement of the 2017 study I refer too.
Conclusion
This updated meta-analysis confirms the association between AD use and incident diabetes. While it still remains a matter of debate whether this association is causal or not, in our opinion none of the biases proposed by previous authors seem able to fully explain it. It is also unclear whether single ADs exert a different effect on the risk of diabetes. Future studies should be aimed at evaluating the impact of single ADs on the incidence of diabetes; given the possible heterogeneity of effect, we suggest that a classification of ADs according to their pharmacological profiles could be useful in better elucidating the nature of this association.
The full 2017 Meta Study can be found at:

Can anybody please have anything to say on this matter? It’s really on my mind and I am looking for others input.",Jun '20
2531,SSRI/SNRI causes T1D?,Type 1 and LADA,Robyn_H,1,"I’m afraid the lack of response is because it’s not something many of us (any of us?) are informed on.  The population here does turn, though.  It doesn’t hurt to keep bumping the topic so someone who CAN comment might see this.
I will throw this out, though…  Diabetes theories/understanding is constantly evolving.
Our best current theory is that it is brought on by a genetic pre-disposition triggered by an immune response, such as might occur with a viral infection.  While anything may be possible, it’s also possible that it has been undiagnosed in your family tree, or that there are recessive genes involved and you finally won the genetic lottery, or even that you developed a new gene mutation pre-disposing you to diabetes.  Until recently, we didn’t even know adults could develop type 1.
It’s okay to pursue your line of questioning, but I don’t think it will do you much good in the long run.  Nothing good can come from harboring blame/anger.  Honestly, you’ve got little chance of winning a legal battle, if that’s your goal.  Just because you can draw a correlation between the drug and diabetes, doesn’t mean you can PROVE causation.  They’re simply not the same thing without a glut of evidence.
Your best bet is to just learn to accept your new way of life.  In all honesty, this is a great time to be diagnosed.  The tools to manage diabetes available today are simply amazing.  It’s no longer a wasting disease where you’re just trying to survive.  You can live a really long, happy, healthy, successful life now, with minimal effort on your part.  And technology is evolving so fast, I can’t even imagine what is coming for us in the near future.",Jun '20

None of my 10 grandchildren have T1, except one grandson did recently develop rheumatoid arthritis, another autoimmune disease. Is it the food we eat, the pollutants we breath, the chemicals in the water we drink? Who knows! 'Nuff said. ",Jun '20
2533,SSRI/SNRI causes T1D?,Type 1 and LADA,Rphil2Type 1 or LADA,1,"This debate has been around since at least 2013.  So to start with, it is not a new question.
In 2017 there was a large study that seemed to indicate that people who use antidepressants had a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes.  I did not find a seminal study about T1 and antidepressants, in fact on Google scholar I did not find a single one.  I imagine one exists, I just did not see it.
OK so what is the evidence behind T2 and the use of SSRI / SNRI medications?  Well i found over 50 such studies and I did not read them all but at least up until 2017 the consensus was the use of these drugs was not in any way shown to be the cause of T2.
Now, a discussion.  There is a  big difference between causation and association.  Almost all studies reflects association.  Meaning that people who use these medications also have a slightly higher incidence of T2.  Well to understand the association I ask if who sees the doctor more?  A PWD or a non PWD?  Do people who see doctors more have a greater or lessor probability of being on these medications?
If you say greater then we can understand what an association is all about.  Seeing a doctor does not cause depression or diabetes but seeing if you see one routinely you might be more likely to be Dx’d with depression or diabetes.  While that may sound simplistic I think it is important to think of other reasons associations between T2 and SSRI / SNRI medications might exist.
Still is this useful information?  Well maybe.  You see all study starts with an acknowledgment of association.  The hard part is the causation.  but it starts with association.  That is where we are with this issue.  There appears to be an association.  Not much more.",Jun '20

I have ones that have been thru PA winters for years - they have easily been heated 500 plus times - they still work but have be redone because the material is getting kind of not so clean

Great thanks.  Do they attract insects or give off oil when heated?


Never had a problem  - here is a link to what I call my masterpiece - it has 3 plus pounds of flax and is 14 by 12 inches - it has sections like if you have a sore hip or such it will not roll off - not a great pic but you get the idea. I had the microwave double the time once and one went to 186 degrees and was still good. With the flax you can make it cold I understand, I have never tried it.

2576,Tidepool,Diabetes Technology,Terry4,,"Cut and pasted from the Tidepool press release Dee linked to above. As a Loop DIY user for the last four years, I’ve enjoyed an extraordinary restoration of my quality of life. I’ve lived with T1D for 37 years. The metabolic sanity it gives me is immeasurable.

Built on the extraordinary foundation of the do-it-yourself diabetes community’s original Loop app, Tidepool Loop is a first-of-its-kind project to take a patient-led innovation and shepherd it through US FDA’s regulatory process with the goal to make the app more broadly accessible to people with diabetes and their clinicians. The app is designed to connect with a variety of compatible insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGM) to automatically dose insulin for the treatment of insulin-requiring diabetes in an effort to keep a user’s glucose within a desired correction range. The goal of the interoperable design is to provide flexibility for users and their healthcare teams to choose the compatible components to which they have the best access or with which they are most familiar using in managing their care.
“We are standing on the shoulders of giants — people in the open source diabetes community who believe management tools should work better together and created software for themselves and their community,” said Howard Look, CEO and co-founder of Tidepool. “Just two years from kicking off the project, we’ve taken that foundation and built a system we’re proud to put in front of FDA. We’re committed to working alongside the agency and our device partners to drive progress in the areas of device interoperability and access, and we look forward to FDA’s review.”

Tidepool is a non-profit effort staffed with people who live with T1D 24/7 and others who love them. I remain hopeful that the output of all this informed altruism will fill in all the missing pieces that commercial enterprises somehow fail to get fully right. We shall see.",3h

But exactly when is unknowable since Medtronc does not usually telegraph its future products.  So anyone who might say they know what the sensor or software upgrades will be is likely not correct.
As for anything a patient might say on the issue can likely be disregarded.  If any one knew what is coming, I likely would and while I do not know it all, I can assure you that I do not know what features might be coning or when.
I can say that I am very happy to have requested an upgrade and am looking forward to getting an upgrade to the 770g.  I hope that no matter what choice you make, that your choice will be wonderful.

I started out by turning CIQ off and setting a 0% temporary basal due to forgetting to not take my AM Lantus dose. Oh well, that’s ok! Still have time to bounce back.
The day went mostly great - I went high a few hours after lunch, but that’s part of the reason I went on the pump and I knew it would take a bit to learn exactly how to use extended boluses. Manually bolusing to correct worked fine.
The trouble started after dinner, around the same time I turned CIQ back on. I bolused too low for my meal, and started chasing that high. I got an alert saying the insulin delivery was stopped due to occlusion. I had read here that people often get false occlusion alerts, so clicked through and tried to bolus again. It worked! Maybe? My blood sugar was still rising.
I bolused again for the new higher blood sugar. That worked with no reported occlusion. Blood sugar still rising. Not sure if an actual occlusion or a pita bread related issue. Going with pita bread as the pump told me the insulin was delivered and I’ve seen pita bread issues in the past.
An hour later, still rising, still oscillating between corrections being delivered and occlusion alerts. I decided to just give it up and go to injections for the night. No glaring issues with the site when I pulled it out in the morning, and I was able to keep the same tubing and cartridge today so no issue there.
I learned/reinforced a few things: don’t test a new site with a tricky meal, think twice before slamming injections when possible, and give yourself some grace.
Today has been a bit better! I went a little high this morning, but know I want to play around with my basal rate to help combat my feet on the floor issues. I’m hoping I get it all figured out soon!",Nov '20

2634,First Day in Tandem T:Slim X2 Rocky Start,Diabetes Technology,Timothy,2,"I had similar issues and I went from Medtronic pump to tandem so it should have been seamless. However it was not.
My carb ratio was the same and most of my hourly basal rates. My insulin sensitivity needed to be greatly reduced. Not because I am less sensitive it it but because CIQ is too slow for my comfort.
Increasing the sensitivity makes it more aggressive in keeping you from going high.

2653,Gastroparesis and type 1 diabetes,Food,david34,,"You cannot thrive and have your body resist the effects of diabetes with a diet of white things.  generally the naturopathic community says to avoid anything white or processed.  I think that part of the problem may be with another hormone rarely if ever discussed called amylin.  you need to eat as many vegetables as possible.  perhaps green smoothies could be the answer.  more on amylin:
How it works
As most people with diabetes already know, insulin helps transfer glucose out of the bloodstream and into the body’s cells. It is produced by a group of cells in the pancreas called beta cells. But beta cells secrete more than just insulin; they also secrete amylin. People with Type 1 diabetes, whose beta cells have been destroyed by the body’s immune system, secrete no amylin at all. And people with Type 2 diabetes who have progressed to the point of needing insulin injections (or infusions from a pump) have limited beta cell capacity and thus produce insufficient amylin.
So why all the fuss about amylin? Those of us with diabetes have survived for years without it. But the goal, of course, is more than just survival. It is to manage blood glucose levels effectively so that we feel good, can perform our daily routines, and live long, healthy, productive lives. The natural hormone amylin, as well as its synthetic equivalent, pramlintide (available since 2005 under the brand name Symlin), helps improve blood glucose control after meals. It does this by prompting the following actions:
Slowing digestion. Amylin slows gastric emptying, or movement of food from the stomach into the intestines. When carbohydrates stay in the stomach longer, they are converted to glucose and enter the bloodstream in a slower, more gradual manner.

Blocking glucagon secretion. Glucagon is a pancreatic hormone that raises the blood glucose level by stimulating the liver to release stored glucose. It is usually secreted in response to stress or hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Without amylin, most people with diabetes produce extra glucagon when they eat; this can contribute to after-meal blood glucose spikes. When taken with meals, Symlin suppresses the inappropriate release of glucagon by the pancreas.

Enhancing satiety (the feeling of fullness). By helping to limit appetite and thus reduce the amount of food eaten during (and between) meals, amylin limits the potential for huge blood glucose",Feb '16

The theory is that the water that you drink with your meal dilutes your stomach acid so your “digesting power” gets weakened. chewing more slowly invites more saliva to go down with your food so your stomach recognizes it as something it needs to digest. Soup is still ok for whatever reason even though it has water in it. I used to have GP a few times a month, some months more, some months none. since I stopped drinking water with meals in 2016, I can count on my hands the number of episodes I’ve had (and can almost always trace it to a trigger, whereas pre-2016 it just happened randomly)
Sometimes, when I start to feel its onset, I can avert an episode by stopping to put anything in my mouth (not even water) and putting a hot water bottle on my belly to coax my stomach to relax while I go take a nap/sleep for the night. If I manage to sleep through it, then I’m saved. If my measures didn’t work, the pain gets worse and I’ll have to vomit in the wee hours to get rid of my breakfast/lunch, it usually takes a whole hour of vomiting to get rid of absolutely everything (and even if there is half lentil left in there, the pain won’t relent!) I realize it’s harder to do my method of aversion when you have full on diabetes and need to watch your BGL dropping too low.
my triggers don’t always trigger, but every time I’ve had an episode, one or a combination of the following were involved:
processed foods esp fatty+sweet processed foods
(probably some additives confusing my stomach)
unsprouted legumes/pulses in large quantity
tough beef in large quantity
coated vitamins (gels capsules were ok, probably the coating confused my stomach)

What type diabetes do they say you have. Sounds like they are treating for type 2 but what ever they are missing the mark. With readings in the range you describe more needs to be done. Have they considered that you might be type 1 diabetic, have they done any antibody testing.
I have moved @Holly3’s post to a new topic
Gary",Oct '20
2659,Diet after DKA,Type 2,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,2,"You don’t mention anything about taking insulin and that sounds to me  that you need it.
40% of us type 1’s are misdiagnosed as type 2’s at first and it happens constantly. One of the problems is as a type 1/LADA you still make insulin for a while until you finally completely stop, sometimes up to 8 years or more. That period you still make insulin we call the honeymoon period. And drugs and change of diet work at first and slowly stop as you make less and less insulin.
DKA is way more common with type 1, although some medications can cause it in a type 2. DKA is caused not by high blood sugar numbers but a lack of insulin which usually occurs at high numbers. But it’s the lack of available insulin that actually causes the issue.
You don’t say what type they have said you are, but I am assuming since you don’t mention insulin you have been told you are type 2.
If you haven’t gotten them already I think you need to be tested for type 1. The 2 most important are an antibody test and a c-peptide test. On an antibody test if you have antibodies you are a type 1, although some type 1’s will test negative but still not make insulin and they don’t know why. The second is a c-peptide which shows how much insulin you are making. Low or low normal is a sign of type 1 as you make less and less insulin until you stop, high or high normal is a sign of type 2, because you still make insulin you just don’t utilize it right and your body will try to make more to make up for it.
Your liver makes glucose for fuel whether you eat or not. So even drinking water as a type 1 your blood sugar level will go up because you are lacking insulin to deal with it.
I’m sorry you are going through all this. good luck and I hope you feel better soon. I hope you find your answers.

I got diabetes as a toddler after getting the flu. You need to see an endocrinologist as soon as possible and demand testing for type 1. If you are not eating and your BG’s are that high you are at constant risk of going into DKA again.
The reason your BG’s were normalized in the hospital is probably due to the electrolytes they were giving you and they may even have given you some insulin to bring you down but didn’t prescribe you any to take afterwards so your BG’s have crept back up into dangerous territory. Keep drinking water and add an electrolyte supplement to it that does not have carbs. Emergen-C makes one and there are several others out there. Alternatively Gatorade zero or Powerade zero are also safe and will help replenish lost electrolytes from the high BG. The risk with DKA is kidney damage or failure so do whatever you need to to stay out of that range.
Go to the pharmacy and pick up urine ketone test strips and and a blood ketone meter and strips if they have them and check your ketones daily or if you are throwing up.

I’ve been T1D for 16 years.  Now on an Omnipod / Freestyle Libre (I have looping set up but am taking a break).
I was a LCHF advocate for five years with excellent HBA1C’s ranging from 41 (5.9%) to 48 (6.5%).  I changed my diet to vegan 10 months ago and was trying to stay LCHF but found this really difficult, limiting and needing to use a lot of processed food.  My insulin sensitivity also had gotten really bad and my I:C ratio was very blunt at around 1:7g or 1:8g
I want to see if I can transition to HCLF plant-based and improve my insulin sensitivity and open the range of plant foods I can enjoy.  I tried this since January but I the sensitivity didn’t improve much and my sugars have regularly been in the 15-20 range after eating (270-360).
I’ve since “fallen off the wagon” and been continuing eating vegan but now am eating high carbs for the first time in years PLUS fats…not a good combo.
By joining the community, I’m hoping to get some support in transitioning in a more methodical way and incorporating exercise which I think was the missing factor.
I will post my results here as I go through this and I hope this might help others also wanting to transition.

2689,"Transitioning from LCHF to HCLF plant-based, follow the journey",Type 1 and LADA,Marilyn6,1,"Ros, when eating no more than 30 daily carbs for 11 yrs, my insulin to carb ratio was about 1 unit for 2 carbs.

Poor man's Afrezza Type 1 and LADA


    Great question!! 
A BG spike after exercise is common. It is more pronounced if the exercise is anaerobic…like weight lifting. Yes running is not usually considered anaerobic but it does use the large muscle groups. 
Muscles store glucose for immediate use when required. Anaerobic exercise taps the muscle stores and consumes the stored glucose. After exercise is over those stores are replenished. The liver, which stores energy as glycogen, will initiate conversion of glycogen to glucose. This “…

2696,"Transitioning from LCHF to HCLF plant-based, follow the journey",Type 1 and LADA,rozomon,1,"Thanks Marie! I have quite a lot of experience with anaerobic exercise as I lifted heavy weights until around September last year. I used to take 1 unit of insulin beforehand and I found this stopped them spiking too much and helped them stabalise afterwards.
My exercise routine had fallen away so I forgot yeterday that I might have such a spike and it was anaerobic so next time I will take around 0.5 - 1.0 unit and see how that helps.
The key I’ve seen is today my blood sugars have been stable and I’ve been on a 20% decrease in basal! @Marilyn6!!! So this is a good sign my sensitivity going up.
I’m fasting today so we’ll see what happens when I eat again tomorrow and I hope if I get the fat/carb balance right again, I will see more sensitivity.  Right now it looks like 1:10 worked ok for the carbs which is already better than my sensitivity was on LCHF.
I really love the diet.  My servings were large but that’s because I’m eating every 2nd day right now while I do this intensive fasting routine (not forever) and they are very low in calories without any oils so you end up eating a lot.

Yes, you can really eat a lot and still lose weight if desired. I am rarely hungry eating this way.

I’ve been fasting every second day since 11 April but my weight is not changing.  Admittedly I have around 15lb-20lb that are more vanity pounds than anything but I would like to fit my clothes better again.  I suspect as my insulin sensitivity hadn’t improved yet may be why the weight hasn’t started to drop…I must hang in there and take it one day, one 30-min walk at a time.

2700,"Transitioning from LCHF to HCLF plant-based, follow the journey",Type 1 and LADA,rozomon,1,"I’ve been fasting since 2015 and it’s helped me a lot.  It is the first time I’ve done such an intensive regime but with the lockdown, I wanted to use the time to see what would happen.  When I eat normally, I usually only have lunch and dinner and maybe a snack in between so I am used to that kind of schedule.
I wanted to fast like this as I am already not moving a lot and I really enjoy the days I fast as I think less about food and I find it a very spiritual practise in helping me to really be with my feelings, including boredom, instead of eating in those moments.  I grow a lot from the experience and have found it very easy to adjust to.
I thought I would lose weight quite easily but what this has shown me is clearly something else is going on as with such a calorie drop, there really should be more of a shift. I suspect it is tied up with exercise, not for the effect of burning calories, but the effect that some resistance exercise can have on insulin resistance.  Body fat is intricately tied up with hormonal balances.  In the past three days with me doing some simple resistance training, I’ve seen a huge impact on my sensitivity and I am already processing those higher carb amounts better so I will keep going and see what effect it has.
For the record, I wouldn’t fast this intensively long-term, it is something I’m experimenting with now but fully expect it to change and adapt.",Apr '20

Things stabalised a lot and I’m happy to see with eating so many carbs such a stable line through the day.

Bkfast: cocoa oats, pea protein powder & 2 lima bean cookies
Lunch: big salad dressed with lemon juice. quinoa and some satay mix of butternut squash
Dinner: more salad and “nice cream” which is frozen blended banana and a bit of cocoa. Some red wine.
Total carbs: 210 Total fat: around 27. Total insulin for day: 41.8 units
Noticeable effects
The day before I got tired of fasting and started snacking absent mindedly on this peanut butter powder (it takes out 90% of the fat) and got a reminder that there are no “free” meals.  I had a huge spike up to 18 overnight and had to take a lot of insulin to bring it down. I won’t do that again.
This time I took insulin of 0.8 units when I did my resistance training and that helped a lot with not having the big spike when I exercised.  Having done the resistance exercise seemed to really help throughout the day with processing carbs…though I am still not seeing a great change in sensitivity.
I had to put temporary basal rates on lowering by 20% as I was more sensitive so this was satisfying to see.
Also, I’ve been having red wine most nights that I eat (every 2nd day) which is being influenced a bit by isolation boredom and wanting to “escape”.  I think it will serve me well to take a break from alcohol and see how that helps things and leaves me feeling so I’ll see how I go with giving that up tomorrow.
I have not found the changes in the diet too difficult…just hoping to see some results soon as tracking details can be tiring and it feels frustrating to put in so much work not to see results.

I had pretty good blood sugars yesterday but frustratingly, don’t see any improvement in my sensitivity.  My sensitivity on LCHF was 1:8 and right now it’s sitting at about 1:10.  I suspect this is the reason I am not losing any weight despite fasting 3-4 days per week.
I went for a run yesterday and I saw that had a big impact on my blood sugar driving it down quite low.  As a result, I undershot for my dinner by about 30grams of carbs and my body seemed to process that well.
More wins are that I am feeling really good about doing the resistance training that I am and feeling motivated to run.  For next week, perhaps I can try to run before a meal, but I would really like to see some changes in my sensitivity!
I’m not taking any wine this week to see if that helps as well.

It was expensive, but we met once a week using video and we could learn from the two guys who started the program and ask questions. It was extremely helpful.
Have you read their book? I haven’t but I think it would be very helpful for you. Have you joined their on line support group? I think you are expecting results too quickly. A week is really no time at all. I don’t want you to get frustrated but to give it some time.
I certainly wasn’t able to go from 1:1 to 1:25 overnight. It took a long time to improve my insulin resistance that much. I did lose 10 lbs but I think it took a couple of months.
As long as you keep your fat content low and exercise things will improve. By the way, I never eat tofu because of it’s fat content.
It looks  like you are doing really well with what you eat. As long as you continue to eat this  way and continue to exercise you will lose weight and your insulin resistance will improve. Try not to look at the scale everyday. I would also suggest that you read the book if you haven’t already done so. You have a lot of will power, so I think you will do really well.
Just want to say that after almost 4 yrs of eating a low fat plant based diet, I feel really good. Considering the fact that I am 69 and have had diabetes for 61 yrs, I would say that I am doing really well. I rode my exercise bike for 2 hrs yesterday. Life is good.",Apr '20

I’ve read most of the materials on their website, watched their YouTube videos and listened to their podcast but I haven’t read all the book.  I will look into how long it takes to arrive to the UK.  I’m on the waitlist for the programme and have been two weeks but I’m not sure when they are opening up more slots.  Right now there seems to be no positions in any programs.
I certainly will keep it up.  Plant-based eating fixed my cholesterol which was really bad on LcHF (9.8 at age 32 and not overweight!!!).  I was on statins and now my cholesterol is perfect without any medication.  Plus, environmentally and ethically, I believe in eating this way to support the eco-system.
You are an inspiration to me with what good shape you are in and for how long you’ve had diabetes.  I am aiming for the long-run as well so thank you, I appreciate the encouragement.

When gyms & cardiac rehab programs closed, I researched at home exercise options. I found a system that allows one to exercise all body parts.


They have aTRX system at my gym and I really like it. They are anchored to a pipe suspension system about two feet above my head. I didn’t get one for home because I don’t have a location where I could mount it in this fashion. You can use it on a door jam, but really haven’t investigated what kind of capabilities you lose in that configuration.
Another option is resistance bands. My wife purchased these and loves them. The training videos are great, the trainer is very responsive to his e-mails,  and most are free.
I’m going back to my gym twice a week now for one-on-one training only. The place is relatively small.  The ventilation system and hygiene protocols are very good. They limit the number of members in at one time via an on-line reservation system that requires 24 hour notice. I know the owner and she understands my situation. I go during their normal slow times and she only lets two other members in while I’m there. I may start using the their treadmills once a week when they’re not busy.

Depending on the exercise you can use them attached to a door (place the door attachment accessory between the door and door jam, then close the door) or stand alone. Some exercises you can use either one. My wife uses both. While we haven’t done it, it’s also possible to use them in the attached mode wherever there is a sturdy structure like the piping you might have in your basement or at a park.
I’m pretty sure you can find some examples if you search on the owner (Dave Schmidt) on YouTube. Or he’s very responsive to e-mails.
Overall we’re pleased. I use them a sometimes. I bought them for my wife, but she’ll let me use them if I behave  My only caution is get a pair of the exercise gloves for the free-standing exercises. Holding the band under resistance would beat up my hands if I didn’t have them.",Sep '20

You are correct the 90 day rule applies to all medicare pump users.  The 180 day rule applies to all medicare MDI users.  I am on the 180 day Dexcom medicare  plan so if I do not get doctor notes to the supplier of my Dexcom equipment within 180 days, all replenishment and shipments stop.  If my doctor supplies notes on say day 200, then the supplier will reactivate subscription on day 200.  Not 1 day before.  And yes, if you are on the G6, medicare will not cover the test strips, regardless of the number of days, pump or MDI plan.   In the example above, no,  medicare will not pay for test strips between months 4 and 6 as they still view you as a G6 user, just delinquent for a couple of months in supplying doctor notes.",12d

Medicare Coverage and Prescribing Information | Dexcom Provider 1





Pump supplies unfortunately require a visit every 90 days. So for those of us with a pump and CGM, we are required to visit the doctor every 90 days. Fortunately a telehealth appointment satisfies this requirement and makes life easier since for me these extra visits are unneeded except for Medicare rules.
Medicare does not consider the Omnipod to be a pump and it is not covered under Part B DME. It is covered under Part D prescription coverage. And Part D does not have the 90-day visit requirement. I think it just requires an annual prescription and maybe (?) a letter of medical necessity.
So if I understand Medicare coverage, if you are using an Omnipod and a Dexcom, you only need a doctor’s visit every 90 days. But you would need to confirm that with your Part D prescription plan. If you have an Advantage plan, you need to confirm everything with that plan.",12d

I’d try putting a layer of tegaderm down and setting the infusion set right through it.  If you don’t get irritation at the sites after that, you’ll know it’s a reaction to the adhesive.  You may also need to talk to your doctor about switching you to a different manufacturer of insulin, because they all use different preservatives.

I am still going to try it a few more times to be sure and then I might start using that from now on.

Why is that steel sets don’t leave scarring or cause skin to harden?
I have another question, this week I tried revisiting another site (buttocks and thighs)that’s not in my abs but this time I use the wipes like skin tac recommended earlier by @Marie20.  I need to use up all my mios before I start on steel sets.
The area is a bit sore but not unbearable and seems to have good sensitivity to insulin and no blockages yet.

I can only guess at the reason(s):  The following is simply a WAG.

A steel set’s diameter is FAR smaller than a soft cannula.  IIRC, the outer diameter of a steel set is .016"" and a cannula is .026"".  Don’t quote me on that as I’m thinking back more than 10 years when I had researched the sizes.  Whatever the actual sizes are, the steel set is much smaller in diameter.
The second thing I can think of is movement and kinking.  Imagine a little worm crawling around in your tissues.

Both of those comments I made are conjecture.  The FACT that I have less tissue damage (I should say no discernible damage) when using steel sets makes me not question too much the reasons why–it just is the way it is.",Feb '20

Over the next year I tried a variety of insulin sensitivity meds while at the same time making huge changes in lifestyle and diet.  Metformin, pioglitazone, glipizide, The meds never seemed to act the way I thought they should – BG trending did not follow med dose changes, etc.  GP saw A1C improvements as evidence of meds working but I believe it was primarily diet and exercise.
I went to an Endo in July '20 and was started on Lantus long acting.  Current is 22U Lantus and 1000mg Metformin, each 1x/day and that seems to work reasonably well (time in range ~90%).  The Metformin is a holdover from the GP timeframe and I don’t believe it is doing anything but the endo doesn’t want to discontinue it for some reason.  I do not use any short-acting insulin. I probably should, but so far I manage by eating low carbs.
My peptide-C test was very near the bottom of the normal range and my GAD was normal.  I understand T2 would typically have a high c-peptide.
I was told 30 years ago and a few times since that I was pre-diabetic but always opted out of treatment, being “bullet proof” at the time.
I had cancer when I was 4yo and subsequent abdominal (at least) radiation, chemo therapy, and surgery to remove one kidney.  My current theory is that the radiation affected my pancreas and my insulin output has been low my entire life and is just now over the “tipping point”.   The normal GAD test and the fact that I make some insulin suggest to me it is not auto-immune / LADA and not “traditional” type 1.

Hormonal birth control prevents you from ovulating and therefore from forming new cysts. Most ovarian cysts do resolve on their own, however, with regular ovulations. Treating decreased insulin sensitivity during menses with hormonal birth control has in itself has the potential to raise your blood sugar, but continuously. Additionally, use of hbc can, over time, lead to high blood pressure thus increasing a diabetic woman’s chances of eye and kidney disease. If you don’t absolutely need the birth control action of the pill I recommend sympto-thermal charting so you can confirm when you ovulate, and anticipate your menstruation. It is then easy to learn to adjust your insulin regimen for times of hormone shifts, such as menses. It is an important skill to acquire for all diabetic women because the same you would have to do during pregnancies and menopause.

Anyone with any experience with Afreeza you’d like to share?


I used for awhile when they had discounted price for those with insurance that didn’t cover it.
I used for meals, mostly 4 unit was similar to 2-2.5 units novolog.   But for meals with higher fat, I would also do extended bolus from pump.   So you may want to still have injected insulin on hand to cover some meals, in addition to afrezza or plan additional Afrezza dose after meal.
Currently I do most bolus from Tandem X2 pump, and Afrezza only for correcting high BGs.

2837,Natural Remedies,Treatment,Rye,1,"I have spent many many hours trying to educate myself on everything there is to know about diabetes and including natural remedies. With diabetes there are many complications or side effects, we never really only have one thing to worry about.

I found taking cinnamon supplements help with lowering blood sugar levels so I take it usually in addition with insulin so I do not have to take too much insulin to bring the numbers down.

I take a super complex vitamin B which helps with metabolism and energy. Vitamin D supplements because I have a deficiency and it gives me so much energy when I do.

Garlic supplements, which does at times seep through your pours even though it says odorless, which helps with my heart and blood pressure. When my sugar levels are high usually I have rapid heartbeats. Garlic is also good for ( men look away) yeast infections which happens often when levels are high.

Aloe-vera , Green, Chamomile teas which helps lower blood sugar, get rid of antioxidants, and calm my tension. I keep tension like it will be worth more than gold one day. Dandelion tea because I also retain water which causes me to swell up and it helps releases it.

Sweet potatoes with butter and cinnamon is not only delicious but it helps lower my sugar levels. Eat a small banana or one low carb yogurt a day for potassium, which helps with muscle cramps my potassium is always low.

I do not drink cow milk, only almond or soy, because it produces mucus and with my horrible sinus/allergies it is a guarantee result of high sugar levels. Water I have to drink a lot of water to avoid dehydration, it will increase my levels also.

Medicine is wonderful however I do not think it is needed for everything, there are more natural ways to help your body. I think if you have an issue tries looking it up online first to see if there are other natural simple remedies that could help. Most often there is and you would be surprise how many things you already own. Of course always listen to your doctor and share with them anything you have learned. Monitor your blood sugar levels always. I just wanted to share a few things that I know that has helped me.",Mar '11

B-12 deficiency can cause neuropathy, I already have enough problems, I don’t need more. Other than that, I’ve never found any “natural” remedies to be of help. It tried all kinds of cinnamon, no help. The closest I came was bitter melon extract which caused a transient lowering of my blood sugar for a week or two, but it just returned to previous levels after that. I take a variety of other supplements, but nothing else worked for blood sugar control.
I found that actually measuring the effect of individual supplements on my blood sugar required careful introduction of the supplement, measurements of blood sugars over a month or more and then stopping the supplement. You can then check the difference. If you do this twice, in a challenge experiment, you can confirm the effect of the supplement.

If the sugars are under control she would probably leave out the gp info from notes but I have no idea how to control my numbers now. I’m willing to go full liquid diet I’ll do anything.

Before intermittent fasting was a fad, I was doing that.  Didn’t eat after 7 pm and skipped breakfast.

Figure out how much insulin you need to maintain your weight.  I need 30 units per day and if I go under that I start losing weight.  Do whatever you can to eat to that.


Figure out what foods your body likes.  I also was told to puree my food and that made me feel like crap.  I tried low carb, but I couldn’t eat enough to maintain my weight, so I needed carbs.


For years I set my alarm at 1:00am to check my BS and if need give a correction bolus.  Nothing will kill you day like starting at 250.

I’d like to hear from the t:slim users, but I don’t think that there is any guarantee that closed loop systems are less work -


I definitely think Control-IQ equals less work!  But, it’s by choice and extra effort in the beginning.  It took me nearly a month to get my optimum settings worked out, but once they are, it’s like Ron Popeil is living in my pump.  “Set it and forget it!” (Did I just date myself???)
I don’t bother counting carbs or stressing over every nibble anymore.  Control-Iq can literally smooth over all the bumps.  I’ve got my basal rates set intentionally high and my correction factor set low, and I stay in sleep mode nearly all the time.  (I just learned @Laddie 's reference to “sleeping beauties” love it!)   These are settings that make the system conform best to my needs.  It opens the availability of insulin to the system, so it can use what it needs to keep me in a happy range.  The reduced correction factor also improves it’s ability to prevent lows.  The combined effect is that I can just generally throw insulin at food, stress much less about everything, and still obtain the best control of my life.
Some would find my behavior risky, but I don’t.  I took way more risks using the R/NPH regiment for 28 years with it’s wild swings, and still slept through the night without any tech monitoring me.  If the lows didn’t get me then, I’m sure as heck not afraid of them now with so many other safety measures in place.",19d

and my correction factor set low


@Robyn_H, please clarify. Are you saying that your correction factor number is set higher for less effect or lower for greater effect? This always confuses me. After a year, I am still hassling with CIQ to just maintain my previous A1c. I would love it to be less work.",18d
2884,Closed loop and Medicare,Community,Robyn_H,,"Actual lower number.  My “true” correction factor should be 1:46, but I have it set to 1:40 or 1:42 in most segments.  Small changes here make a big difference.  You can see, it’s not a big enough change to really throw off the bolus calculator. (Not that I use it anymore, but I know most do).
Since Control-IQ works in both directions we can redefine what the correction factor is.  It’s going to bring you back to target eventually, no matter what this number is, it’s exactly like trying to correct yourself with an extended bolus, though. You’re only getting a fraction of the correction every five (or 6?) minutes. It should now be thought of as how fast you want correction automations to work.  The higher the correction factor, the slower the correction and the flatter your basal trend.  Too high, and it’s like flat-lining your basal rate.  It’s crippled for both correcting highs and lows.  The lower the number, the steeper the basal changes happen.  The lower the number, the faster you’ll recover from lows and more likely to avoid them in the first place, AND the faster you’ll bring down an elevated BG via basal changes alone.
So why not just set your correction factor at 1:1? Or some other ridiculously low number? That sounds like a good thing…  But no, if you go too low, you actually get over-corrections on both ends. If you’re looking at your CGM stats, your GVI will go up.  It will withhold too much insulin for a low, and you’ll shoot back up high, then it will deliver too much correction insulin and you’ll overshoot the low threshold before it can turn it around again… And the sharp up and down cycle repeats.
For those that understand wave dynamics, we’re talking a basic sine wave:

Reduced numerical correction factor (the numerical value) = decreased wavelength and increased amplitude.
Increased correction factor (the numerical value) = increased wavelength and decreased amplitude.
The axis of your wave (mid-point, baseline, node) is established by your basal rate.  If your wave is fluctuating nicely but your BG is staying too high, increase your basal.  If it’s fluctuating nicely but your staying too too low, decrease your basal.


Sorry @lainiep .  I know this is a lot of information, and may seem overwhelming.  But once you get the settings dialed in where you want them, it does equal a much easier solution going forward from there.",18d
2885,Closed loop and Medicare,Community,irrational_JohnType 1 or LADA,,"Per the ref quoted below from the link below, another common term for “correction factor” is “Insulin sensitivity factor” or ISF.
Your ISF is the amount 1 unit of insulin will decrease your Blood Glucose.  In the United States, this is measured in mg/dL (milligrams per decilitre). The number will look differently in other countries where BG is measured in mmol/L (millimoles per liter).
A pump uses the ISF (or CF) to determine how much insulin to bolus to correct a high BG. You divide the amount you want your BG to decrease by the ISF to get the amount of insulin for the bolus. Because you are dividing by the ISF, a smaller ISF results in a larger bolus.

This is my experience, too. I suspect many mass-produced breads contain added sugar to speed up yeast activity.

I’m in Switzerland now, where even the “big bakeries” (like Reinhard) make all their breads in traditional ways. Now, lots of those breads are made with a poolish or biga or starter, and they tend to be whole-grain and incorporate seeds and nuts, but they are as commercial as one can get. Guess what… other than the “croissants” (which are actually Gipfeli and just look and taste like croissants, but definitely aren’t according to the Swiss), none of the breads here spike me like the stuff back in the good old U.S. of A.
It’s some kind of flour conspiracy!

But as someone who’s taken insulin most of her life, I want to seriously stress that insulin in a scary and dangerous game.  The potential side effects of insulin are WAY worse than you’ll find with oral medications.  I seriously doubt you’ll find a single type 1 among us who has never had a life-threatening hypo.  Given the insulin-resistance of type 2, you’ll likely need unusually large amounts of insulin, increasing the inherent danger.  It’s not something i would wish on anyone unless you absolutely need it.
I feel like you’re making this decision much too lightly if you’re making it just to avoid nausea and/or diarrhea.  Aside from hypoglycemia, potential adverse reactions to the DRUG insulin (it’s still a pharmaceutically manufactured drug, don’t be misled because it mimics a natural hormone.  The drugs are different) include: allergic
reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash, pruritus, Onychomycosis, sensory disturbance, urinary tract infection, chest pain, headache, skin disorder, abdominal pain, sinusitis, DEATH, etc…  Does insulin still sound like your first treatment choice???  This is precisely why you SHOULD expect pushback from your doctor.  It’s not the safer nor easier option you seem to think it is.
Myself, and a lot of other Type 1s, have started taking Metformin in addition to insulin, because it reduces the amount of basal (background/long-acting) insulin I need.  So I speak from experience when I tell you that Metformin does get better.  The first month undeniably and absolutely sucks, but then I never experienced the GI distress again.  And honestly, even if the side effects never faded, I would take them any day in lieu of insulin, if I could.
Thankfully there are other options if you don’t want the Metformin.  Every prescription drug comes with a scary list of potential side effects, but that doesn’t mean they are common or that you’ll experience any of them.

Truth be told, most if not all doctors are likely to view your request from the frightful perspective expressed in Robyn’s earlier post. So I’m not optimistic about your chances of being prescribed insulin, if that is what you still believe you actually want. But the only way to find out is to discuss it with your doctor and find out how that goes.
For what it’s worth, here’s what happened with me back in mid 1978.
I was an enlisted man in the Navy in my mid 20s going to language school in Monterey, CA. My fasting blood glucose was extremely high and I was down about 40 lbs to a noticeably skinny 160, so I was diagnosed as an adult-onset (i.e. T2) diabetic and put on whatever oral medication they prescribed back then.
While I was home on leave in December, I saw a civilian physician in Milwaukee who gave me a glucose tolerance test. The test showed I was producing 1/2 of the insulin expected so he recommended I take supplemental insulin. In today’s terms, I was not a T2 but a LADA T1, a distinction the medical community was only starting to recognize at that time.
However that doctor didn’t (couldn’t?) prescribe insulin for me. Instead, I brought it up with an Air Force doctor I saw when I returned from leave to my next training school in Texas. After consulting with the civilian doctor, I was prescribed the supplemental regular insulin the civilian doctor recommended.
So I picked up that the insulin and syringes from the base pharmacy and then went back to my room and proceeded to use it as prescribed. Yes, I had episodes of hypoglycemia. Did it kill me? Not that I recall.  Still, I doubt that this is unlikely to be the experience anyone else would have.

I’m not disputing what @Robyn_H says here but I do want to temper it a little bit.  I do so out of experience. Being Type 2 and very insulin resistance I am the perfect example of what she says, I can do some industrial size boluses. I am human and I can make mistakes that would make me susceptible to crushing lows considering the size of my boluses.
I have had some low, my worse ever were in the mid forties and I was functional, I have never felt I had a low that I felt was life threatening. I credit my good fortune to the remaining amount of natural insulin production I have left. I believe it acts as a buffer to extreme lows.
Even with what I just said I cannot and do not discount what @Robyn_H said. A failing pancreas can be a fickled thing, I do not try to out think it.
I did not start with insulin, I went thru the whole oral meds routine, I did not ask for insulin, I avoided it, but once I started it I realized it was the best treatment for me. That was me after 15years on orals, insulin was finally something that really worked.
I have no love affair with insulin, it is a love/hate thing. I am past the point of no return. I couldn’t go back to oral meds if I wanted to but if I could I would consider it. Using insulin is no walk in the park. It takes constant attention, and constant preparation. It involves itself in every decision and every aspect of your life. When you are insulin dependent diabetic there are no time outs, or days off, or minutes off, or even seconds. It may not consume 100% of your thoughts but it and all that goes with it consumes at least a small percentage 100% of the time.
Although I had no choice in the matter but to start insulin I realize that when I chose insulin I chose the best thing and the worst thing at the same time. I also gave up something that I can never regain, a sense of freedom, never again can I leave my house without thinking, am I OK on the insulin front.",30d

Because I was controlling my numbers fairly well without meds as recently as a year ago, i feel like i’m still hanging on to that mindset.

I knew a lady about 35 years ago whose GP prescribed only insulin for diabetes of either type, and she said she could take an entire bottle and her sugar would not go down.
Third, the standard treatment for Type 2 is initially Glucophage, which eventually stops working, and must be supplemented. Since we still do not understand the best treatment for Type 2, the best treatment after Glucophage stops working is not clear: some say to switch to a different oral medication, others say add another oral medication to Glucophage, some say add insulin to Glucophage, while some say add both another oral medication and insulin to Glucophage.

2930,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,irrational_JohnType 1 or LADA,,"I am confused so perhaps I have completely misunderstood your situation. My perhaps mistaken understanding is that while you currently use Medtronic’s 630G pump you also use Dexcom’s G6 CGM.
What benefits are you hoping to reap from upgrading to a newer model of Medtronic pump?
The additional capabilities in Medtronic’s newer pumps are, I think, only available when you also use Medtronic’s CGM. If you use Dexcom’s CGM then I am not aware of any benefit to using the 630G, the 670G, or the recently approved (in the US) 770G. Whichever “smart” algorithm these pumps may be capable of implementing, they are all based on information about your blood glucose derived from a Medtronic CGM system.
It is not  my intent to comment in any way on either Dexcom’s or Medtronic’s CGM systems. I am simply pointing out that Medtronic pumps will not natively support any CGM other than a Medtronic CGM.
I am vaguely aware that some folks have come up with open source experimental work-around software. However, I’m not sure if these home brew systems will work with the newer Medtronic pumps. My expectation is that Medtronic has been working very hard to prevent that.",27d
2931,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,Dee_Meloche,,I realize that but I was using the enlit sensor with my 630 and I didn’t like it so I switched back to dexcom as I was using dexcom with my animas vibe.

I work in a laboratory and often I can’t take out my pump or phone. The loop will correct for me and that’s worth a lot to me.
I gave up on medtronic with enlite sensors. It was too much of a headache. I have not tried the guardian ones though.
If you are using dexcom, the new pump won’t be any different than your current one because it won’t accept data from dexcom.
So if you want to use dexcom you will need to go with tandem or omnipod.
I think Medtronic pumps are really good. My old 523 still works.
However for me it’s all about the sensors and loop control.
You still have to calibrate guardian sensors twice a day. Ugh.
I had 2 a1 c since I got my tandem and dex. 5.9 and 6.0.
That’s something I was never able to get nwithout looping.
My nights are flat lines. My dawn phenomenon is handled awesomely.
It’s not a hands off system by any means but I really like it.

 Dee_Meloche:

I heard that medtronic has improved their sensor and was thinking of upgrading to the 670.


I am using the Guardian Link 3 transmitter/sensor CGM with my 630G. My impression from looking at Medtronic’s web site is that the 670G also uses Guardian Link 3. My feeling is that as a user you are unlikely to experience any difference between Guardian & Enlite.
The sensors are the same size. They insert and tape down pretty much the same way Enlite did. The transmitter is exactly the same in terms of size and usage.
The only ostensible difference that comes to mind is that Guardian is supposed to last for 7 days while Enlite was nominally 6 days. However, over the last several months after 5 days of use I’ve been getting the cryptic error message  “SG Value Not Available”. After that the sensor had to be replaced. So I wasn’t always getting that 7’th day anyway. 
I think the 770G also still uses the Guardian 3 CGM if I’m reading the specs on the web site correctly. So I don’t think you’d be happy with either pump. If you weren’t happy with Enlite CGM I wouldn’t expect you to be any happier with Guardian Link 3.
But if you have doubts, talk to Medtronic about it. If my take on the CGM is correct you can ask to demo the CGM the 670G or 770G use with your 630G. Then you’d have a better idea whether or not you’d be happier with the supposedly improved CGM.",27d
2934,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,Dee_Meloche,,The more I read about the 670 the more I am thinking it would be more mental burden than what I am doing now.

2935,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,mohe0001,,"670g is the closed loop system.
All I know is what people tell me. They do not like it.

2936,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,Rphil2Type 1 or LADA,,"I have used the 670g since 2017 and will soon be upgraded to the 770g.  Upgrading to the 670g is not likely the best move.   You better move would be to consider the current medtronic upgrade option to 770g.  That costs $700 but you will be refunded $400 when you return you current in warranty pump.
At least that is how it works for the 670g to 770g.  I think it is the same for the 630g.
If you can do this i believe the advantage is it will not lengthen you upgrade horizon.  As far as insurance is concerned you should still be able to upgrade again on your normal schedule.

2941,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,davyboy,,"I looked hard at the 670g before I decided to go with Tandem X:2 t-slim & Dexcom g6. Here’s why:


My 15 year track record with Medtronic is miserable. Their customer service is bad. They are extremely bureaucratic, somewhat onerous when I raised issues like their reservoir fill method being faulty, and they respond slowly to requests.


Engineering. I think a 5th grader could engineer the pump better. If you compare their sensor installation process to that of Dexcom g6, it’s like night and day. It takes about 1 minute to completely change out the g6, with no fuss. The tape never folds on you like Medtronic does.  The 670g is not a compact or light pump; Tandem’s t2:slim is very light and compact. Their pump accepts software upgrades; Medtronic doesn’t, on purpose. They want to sell the ever growing number of upgrades. Since I bought my t2:slim, they downloaded the high-glucose correction software into my pump; it is now almost closed loop. I don’t know how many times it brought my highs down into a decent range without me even knowing it. And it works really hard to keep you from dropping below 80. It’s behavior is as you would expect; you  don’t have to go thru 5 steps to input a glucose reading.


Accuracy and glucose tracking. This is the deal-breaker if what I said before doesn’t do it.  I was trying to get Medicare to explain to me WHY they cover the Tandem-g6 combo as DME but not cover the 670g sensor. They couldn’t explain it till they got me to a guy who helped decide that policy. Here is the rationale in a nutshell: The 670g sensors have to be calibrated at least twice a day, else it won’t track. Moreover, Medtronic tells you to check your glucose before any meals and before shooting a bolus.  So it doesn’t meet the Medicare standard for being an integral part of the pump. Therefore it’s not qualified as DME which automatically means Medicare doesn’t cover it under Original Medicare B.


The Dexcom g6 DOES qualify as an integral part of the Tandem pump for the same reasons the Medtronic DOES  NOT. You don’t need to calibrate two times a day and the readings it gives you are reliable to use for bolusing. Therefore it is an integral part of the Tandem Pump system, which makes it DME.",25d
2942,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,Dee_Meloche,,"The more I think about it, it makes me mad that me diabetes team didn’t really give me any options on making the tslim work for me. If medtronic never integrates with dexcom my chances of having a closed loop system is almost impossible. I heard that there are kids on this pump. Why didn’t it work for me! Sorry, just venting a little bit. I heard that they can dilute the insulin or they can give you a smaller concentration like u50.",25d
2943,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,Timothy,,"You can also vary basal schedule. 0.1 for a half hour and 0.0 for a half hour ends up 0.05 for the hour.
I hear about this issue a lot on here. I’m just a little surprised so many have such low insulin needs.
If I only needed 2.4 units for an entire day or less, I would likely not bother with a pump at all.
I would think your prime uses more insulin that it delivers.",25d
2944,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,Dee_Meloche,,I guess I shouldn’t complain so much. I can get between 80-90% in range most days. I just have to do all the work to manage. I have 2 years to see what happens with insulin pumps. Alot can happen in 2 years.,25d
2945,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,,"I’m gonna strongly urge you to consider the dilluted insulin route again.  Your needs are exceptionally and unusually small.  Like, similar to what an infant weighing less than 10 lbs might need (and they’re not put on pumps).  I’m afraid that no pump on the market is able to accurately deliver your doses… Not the Tandem, nor Medtronic’s 670, and I highly doubt the 770 or 780 will be different enough to be that accurate either.
I’ve always suspected that most of your confusion and problems you ask about stem from the fact that you’re not actually getting consistent insulin delivery, because the pumps just aren’t that capable. Its why people are so confused when you talk about your insulin being diluted by blood, when blood is the route in which insulin travels… It doesn’t dilute it.  I suspect that’s you trying to rationalize poor pump behavior.
I think ANY pump you choose would behave better if you were delivering more volume at a time, because the errors would be less noticable. It will be more confusing at first and you’ll need some help with your pump settings, because you’ll have to learn to increase your dosages.  But if you can stick it out for the few weeks it takes to develop a new habit, I really think you’ll appreciate the outcome.  Right now, you’re operating the pump in extremes it’s not designed for.

2948,Medtronic 670g,Diabetes Technology,Timothy,,"I was able to use dexcom with my Medtronic pump.
I used a g4 but I think it could work if you know how to solder.
You need to simply solder the 2 connectors on the dexcom that you have put in your arm. To the Medtronic sensor that you have dismantled. Taken off the sensor portion to reveal the 2 wires. Then install the guardian transmitter.
You will need to calibrate every 12 hours though.
I’m not saying it isn’t a lot of work but it is possible to do.
I ran like this for a few months and I got good data.
Then I got very tired of the process.
I assume the g6 will work the same way,  but I can’t be sure.
The signal coming off the sensor is just a number of micro amps.
It’s the receiver that translates it into a glucose concentration.
The calibration sets the norm baseline.
If you have patience, soldering skill and time, you can experiment.
Oh and it takes up more space on your arm and you need to tape it.
I used one uv3000 to cover the whole mess. It’s not waterproof on it’s own.

Not necessarily. All pumps in Ontario (if not Canada) cost roughly the same, so it doesn’t make much difference to ADP which pump you get. The only thing I’d caution is that, from what I hear (I haven’t come up to my first renewal yet), the replacement after five years is not guaranteed – if your pump is in fine working order and your A1c’s are good, they may not pay for a new pump. (Especially now, with provinces strapped for money because of Covid.) I suggest you talk to your endo’s office. Often the staff is used to fudging – sorry, I mean handling applications for replacements.",26d

I feel like because those pumps tend to have inaccuracies in their dosing, you might have a harder time than some. I just worry that because you require such small, precise dosages, that error might hit you harder than most.
I’m open to discussion about this, but I feel like the tech has been pretty similar for decades. They don’t re-engineer the thing frequently. MT just doesn’t do a lot of engineering work.

3060,Circadian glucose phenomenon,Diabetes Technology,Terry4,,"I’ve observed many times that a significant low or high blood sugar event tends to produce a metabolic “echo” 24 hours later. Let’s say that at noon one day you find your blood sugar too high, maybe 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L), and your troubleshooting reveals a bent cannula that impedes steady insulin absorption. You replace the infusion set at a fresh site and your blood sugar then drops into a healthy range.
But then you’re surprised, around noon on the next day, by an elevated BG, perhaps at 180 (10), that cannot be reasonably explained by other factors. Even though the trigger event, in this case a bent cannula, is absent on the following day, the blood sugar still marches upward like some kind of salute to the prior day’s excursion. I’ve experienced this phenomenon many times over many years.
I know that blood glucose levels are the result of a complex interaction of not just glucose and insulin but also of cortisol, adrenaline, thyroid hormones, sex hormones, the immune system, sleep status, and other factors.
This 24 and sometimes 48 and 72-hour circadian echo happens even when the first day’s trigger is removed. I speculate that the body’s powerful circadian rhythm prompts this collection of hormones to anticipate this aberrant glucose excursion repeating and stages what I call a circadian glucose phenomenon.
Here’s a recent example that I experienced. Let me first explain what triggered this hyperglycemia.
My automated insulin dosing system, Loop, contains a protection setting called, suspend threshold. The idea is to set a floor level BG below which the system will suspend all basal insulin deliveries. This safety setting protects you from the inevitable chaos of diabetes.
My Loop program resides on my iPhone and I must have accessed that screen and placed my phone back into my pocket while it was still active. This happened in the late evening, near bed-time. This “pocket-dial” event caused me to set the suspend threshold to a ridiculously high setting. That meant that all my BGs would never exceed my suspend threshold setting and my basal rates were all set to zero.
When I woke up the next morning, here’s the mountain-top CGM trace I saw.

Finally, four days later and the influence of 12/14 hyperglycemia event is extinguished.
A correlation to this happens when I enjoy a particularly great BG day, I find that the following day tends to follow the previous day’s BG results. This occurs even if I’ve relaxed my eating and exercise standards some on the following day. It’s as if my glucose trends produce an ensuing “stickiness” in the days that follow.",18d

Recently I have discovered that drinking my own electrolyte drink seems to be directly correlated with sleeping better/reduced hot flashes at night. I don’t drink more water (I have never been super thirsty even when I have had signs of  mild dehydration light dry lips, constipation etc.). I just add 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp salt substitute (measurements form Dr. Bernstein, but for 1 quart of liquid, when vomiting/diarrhea) and some magnesium powder. I am 55 yo and have decreasing estrogen, but I don’t consistently have hot flashes at night. I also see a correlation between hot flash frequency and if I have fasted for half the day the day before. Fasting is known to increase cortisol levels. Low carb can lead to mild dehydration, and the advice  I have seen is to increase salt intake to combat this. Bright lights at night can also raise cortisol levels- if I pay attention to reducing bright light exposure at night, I also get fewer hot flashes. So my list of things that seem to raise cortisol and increase my hot flashes are: fasting, bright light at night, and being low on electrolytes, emotional stress. I am thinking paying attention to ameliorating high cortisol levels is good for blood sugar control as well. Thoughts?",26d

So if I had a slice of bread and it’s 15g, I bolus enough for 25g, I would peak around 160mg and it would pivot downwards quicker - it may get to 100mg in two hours but it’s a free fall to hypo land after that because I have too much insulin stacked.

It’s only in VERY recent years that the common Endo is believing you can stay in range post carbs.  Joslin and other diabetes innovators aside.  It’s also only in recent years that we’re starting to evolve away from the carb-heavy food pyramid guidelines.  Heck, we still see posts often here about “my endo/nutritionist/DE/fill-in-the-blank” says I need to eat more carb"".
The common doctor catering to diabetics is so scared of lows, that they EXPECT us to be high and out of range in the post-prandial.  Within two hours, though, the bolus should have you back in range.  Not necessarily at your target BG, just in range.  “Excellent management” used to be defined as obtaining 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol) within 2 hours of a meal.
I have the 5th edition of Pumping Insulin (2012, I think 6th is the most recent), and I feel like it is already largely outdated.  This is an image from the chapter about corrections:
Screenshot_20210103-0738471080×798 130 KB
You can see that the Goldilocks “just right” correction factor brings you down over the course of 5 hours, but should be leveling off around the 3-4 hour range.
In that example, the “too low” value still took them 3 hours to get back down to 100, but it’s too fast, because they’re going to continue dropping beyond that.  3 hours feels like a lifetime of elevated BG to me!  But that was before we had options to suspend basal.
Now, we’re seeing a lot more options to tightly control the numbers.  Low carb/moderate to high protein and fat diets, high carb/low fat diets, greater availability of CGMs, looping, commercial pump semi-closed loops, super-bolusing, etc…
We’re in a great transition where 100% TIR is actually becoming achievable  WITHOUT increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, but all the terminology and medical professional mindset hasn’t caught up yet.

One thing that’s designed to help with the spike situation you’re describing is to use an extended bolus (assuming you’re using a pump), so the insulin’s effect curve is more spread out. Another is pre-bolusing, vs “super bolusing” (though I definitely do that too). It just does seem to be the case that it’s harder to chase down a BG that’s already getting ahead of the insulin than to get ahead of the carbs to begin with. That should help with getting your peak to arrive somewhere in the 140-160 range rather than 200+.
But another thing is a kind of pet peeve of mine, especially dealing with endo’s who are schooled in the literature but not living with the disease themselves. Which is that all these numbers tend to give a false sense of precision, like there’s some reliable formula for manually operating a system originally evolved to be governed by webs of biochemical feedback loops. It’s not like the numbers aren’t helpful as a general guideline, but they’re never going to exactly match what you experience in practice. For me, getting a “soft landing” after a high-carb meal in a reasonable amount of time is a combination of past experience working in concert with what my CGM is telling me in the present, and creating a kind of informed-intuition feedback loop in realtime. Because bodies are all different, not all carbs are the same, and other variables like stress can play a role. So knowing what the rule books say is a good place to start from, but in the end it’s always going to be an empirical process, not a cut-and-dried mathematical one.",5d

Good point and a very informative post, as I have come to expect from you @Robyn_H. One thing I want to mention—and I know not everyone is a fan, but—Jardiance. It’s off-label for T1, but my endo started me on it about 2 years ago and it has had a huge effect on limiting my peaks and valleys, and dealing with the issues that are the subject of the OP.
No side effects I’ve ever detected, and since I started on it I’ve had A1C’s below 6.0 for the first time in 37 years with T1. It seems to have a general, overall effect of attenuating my BG curves, so that they’re oscillating within a much tighter and lower range over all. Way more useful in that respect, with much less aggravation, than what I found when I tried an AID system (670G).",5d
3081,Where should BG be 2 hours after eating carbs?,Diabetes Technology,Terry4,4,"The ideal post-prandial blood glucose levels for comparison occur in healthy non-diabetic individuals. Now, I recognize that we do live with diabetes and this comparison may seem unfair, but I think it helps illuminate just what the ideal should be.
In this NIH study, Continuous Glucose Profiles in Healthy Subjects under Everyday Life Conditions and after Different Meals 2, they showed what the CGM trace after meals looked like.
Screen Shot 2021-01-03 at 9.43.15 AM1548×1270 183 KB
In non-diabetic people, the post-meal trace average rises just above 120 mg/dL for breakfast and just under 120 for lunch and dinner. Following all three meals, the BG falls to under 100 mg/dL at two hours. (IG=interstitial glucose)
Insulin acts during the 5-6 hour period after sub-q injection, whether its injected for a meal or for a BG correction. Its action is weighted in the early portion of that time. Two hours is an arbitrary time-mark that some use to aid analysis.
It might seem unfair to compare people with diabetes to non-diabetics but I think knowing what the ideal is can help us. If we’re going to shoot for a target, I think it’s helpful to aim for a beneficial one.
With limited carbohydrate diets (or high carb, ultra low-fat), adequate pre-bolusing, consistent daily exercise, and an automated insulin dosing system, I think it’s possible to approximate the post-meal blood glucose levels of non-diabetic people. In fact, many adherents of the Bernstein protocol consistently achieve this goal using multiple daily injections.
In the graph, you can see the 2 standard deviation traces above and below the average or mean. Since so many non-diabetics are not metabolically healthy, these excursions provide an interesting comparison. It seems people with T1D could reasonably produce post-meal traces within these limits.
In the ideal, I seek to limit post-prandial BG traces to 140 mg/dL at one hour and 120 mg/dL at two hours with a drop to below 100 mg/dL soon after. I can often do this.",5d

Great explanation.  I’m curious what the graph looks like for others when they eat and bolus for a slice of wholemeal bread.  I guess the thing I’m trying to work out is is my pattern “normal” or have I got something wrong (be it bolus, basal, correction factor).  I did ask my DE and she basically said I’m doing well with my control with my latest Hb1AC and TIR and not to get too hung up about the post meals.  But that’s like a typical response for a DE that doesn’t have diabetes, inside me I’m thinking it’s these post meal control that I’m battling with all the time, and I would like to get to the bottom of - be it that I’m doing something wrong or have the wrong expectations.

I’ve tried both actually, I find that the extended bolus have very little effect.  Maybe its the amount injected every 5 mins is so small its not able to put a dent on a rising BG - and I find with novalog this often happens.  If I make the dosage higher for my extended bolus, I feel I’m injecting so much more insulin.  If I set my initial dose lower (say 60% as opposed to 80%) to allow for more insulin delivery in my extended bolus,  I find my BG shoot up high very quickly, so a very steep incline on the graph.  And then I start to battle with insulin resistance bringing down the BG.

For this, I think we should be comparing apples to apples in terms of food.  If this is the graph for a non diabetic who has eaten a full plate of pasta, I’m interested to see what it looks like for a diabetic eating the same plate of pasta.   Is this 2 hour mark achievable using insulin?  And I mean for most diabetics not just a small minority.  If it is achievable, then the 2 hour mark is a realistic benchmark.
For me specifically, I can’t seem to get this 2 hour BG decline back to or close to target BG.   It could be the way my body reacts to carbs or maybe my dosage is wrong (my DE hasn’t called out any concerns with my dosage) or a number of other factors .

I decided 8 years ago that I could not consistently get my insulin dosing correct if I wanted to continue to consume a high carb diet. I knew that I could occasionally get the insulin dose size and timing right but if I miscalculated my overall insulin sensitivity, insulin to carb ratio, or some other unknowable physical x-factor, then I was put into play like some pinball subject to the chaos of a risky and high stakes game.
With the exception of those who eat a high carb ultra low-fat diet, I don’t think T1Ds can eat a high-carb high-fat diet, the Standard American or Australian Diet, and consistently dose insulin well enough to achieve the post-meal glucose found in the non-diabetics in this study.
I was very reluctant to limit the carbs in my diet; I didn’t want to give up bagels and pasta. I thought of these kind of foods as contributing to my quality of life.
Now I wonder what took me so long. I much prefer the metabolic sanity I now enjoy compared to the metabolic mayhem I lived with for far too long. I’m no longer bloated, overweight, with a foggy mind.
Insulin dose size, timing, and attention to many details can only get you so far with regard to post-meal BGs. What you eat is crucial to hitting those targets.



 tedos:

This is achievable even for me with a protein meal, but I’m interested whether others have any success in bringing down the BG in 2 hours after eating carbs.


Like I said, I think this can be done on a limited basis but as far as doing this dependably day after day, week after week, without the drama of soaring highs, screaming BG descents and high glucose variability, I remain skeptical.",5d

3094,Chromium Picolinate Flat Lines After Meal Spike,Type 1 and LADA,CJ114,6,"I have been working on lowering my cholesterol naturally to reduce or eliminate statin use.  @JaninaWalker on this forum suggested I take Chromium Picolinate and that my insulin requirement would go down so I told her after my cholesterol test, I would try that next and started reading all about it.  There is tons of anecdotal evidence that it works/does not work even on this forum starting 2008.  Armed with everything I read and my Dexcom G5 CGM, I decided to try it immediately since carbohydrate reduction could improve cholesterol results and started taking 1000iu once a day with my daily meal.  I am OMAD.  Although I hate taking any supplements and want to rely on food and exercise, this product has been a real winner for me, and I believe can be of great benefit to some T1 and T2 diabetics (YDMV).
If you are on a CGM, try it out and you will know within just a very few days if this helps you.  I take 1000iu for my one meal per day as many complained of no results on low dose.  I tried an evening snack as a test on top of my OMAD (without taking additional Chromium) and the spike came back not quite as high so it really appears to be important to take at mealtime as it seems to have a pretty short lifespan.  There are several hypotheses why this stuff works but I will spare you the details unless that becomes part of this thread discussion.  As long as you can measure your results, not guesses and feelings about this supplement, please try it and report back.  I believe that a lot of our forum members could benefit.
The Good
•	Pre-Bolus then Flat lined after lunch avoiding usual after lunch 50-70 mg/dl spike from day 1
•	Prior to use sometimes I would want a few Almonds or peanut butter lollipop after work – Curbed my appetite so now rarely wanted after day 2.  Need to eat a little more at my meal as I started to lose weight Day 3
•	Dropped my insulin requirement from day 1 dramatically.  I cut insulin use 25 % day 1 and went low several hours later, cut 50% day 2 and went low again, cut 80% day 3 and still went low.  Day 4 cut insulin use 90%. And increased food consumption 150 calories with 6g of additional carbs to maintain weight and my after-lunch BG did go up 39 mg/dl. My I:C went from 1:3 to 1:10 but then by second week worked its way back down to 1:5.
•	It is very inexpensive.  I paid $9.99 delivered for a 2-pack total 360 tablets at Amazon
•	Day 4 on feeling great, no more side effects
•	Flatlining after meals appears to reduce LDL oxidation and vascular inflammation leading to lower cardiac risks.  (I am still in test mode on this one and will detail in cholesterol thread)
•	Started taking Jan 27, 2020 so will update any long term changes
The Bad
•	I hate improving my health with any non-natural product such as a supplement but just can’t get sufficient Chromium dose through foods for these results.
•	Day 1 got a headache
•	Day 2 Mild headache almost gone but felt dizzy before and after meal
•	Day 3 No headache but still a touch of dizziness
•	Need to reduce insulin or eat more and gain weight
•	It does nothing for insulin correction.  In other words if you take let’s say 1 unit of insulin and drop BG 20 points, taking chromium picolinate in liu of insulin does not reduce BG.  It just helps process food you recently ate better.
•	When you are intermittent fasting, chromium has no effect on BG.  You only benefit when chromium picolinate and food are consumed at about the same time.
•	This is a tool, not a solution. For meals that usually spike 50-70 mg.dl I flatline instead of spike.  If, however, I carbo load on pizza or pasta which would normally spike me 150-170 mg/dl, I will have a much lower spike, but will still spike 70-100 mg/dl.
•	I have not yet tested different dose levels so do not know at what point a lower dose no longer has any effect.  I would love to hear from others.

I don’t think so as my CGM matches well to my finger sticks and my Lab A1C’s match well to my Dexcom GMI.

Do NOT get the shorter briefer volume as it is 28 cents more expensive and less than half the size and misses out most of the important aspects including how a newly diagnosed person can attempt to look into ways of reversing diabetes.You would need a third book to get the free shipping. I have bought 3 editions of Bernstein's main book in the past 11 years and I bought the diet book and wish I had not, as it was a waste of money after having the big book. He keeps adding to his main book. Don't try to read an outdated version. Only get edition 4. Don't get the Diabetes Diet book by the same man as it is too simplistic and misses out on so much from his larger book which will take a long time to read and will be a reference. The shorter version is even more expensive by 28 cents. If you are not a reader, still get the bigger book, hands down. The Bernstein group here on Tudiabetes is worth reading going back a few years. Don't only read current contributions.Have you had any metals put into your dental work? That caused my diabetes within one year. I had a gold-copper crown put on when I was 23 and within a year I was diabetic. I had NO virus. I was an active person who did not eat a lot. It took many years to become disturbed about diabetes. It even went away for almost a year, called a honeymoon phase. I bought a bike and walked a lot and rode, and often was not needing insulin.What I didn't do and should have done was turn to eating lots of vegetables. Chances are you may not do that either as it can be that cooking is too complex for some people, especially men and when they move away from home they may eat whatever is easy. I have a BF who does not eat veggies and he can easily be caught with a high blood sugar level.Still do all you can to reverse diabetes as the longer you take insulin the more diabetic you become. It is not a black and white thing. If you are still producing a lot of insulin, then do all you can to make that insulin work better by taking chromium. B vitamins also mean less insulin is needed. If you drink alcohol and avoid red meat fed on grass which is just about all these days, you could be low on Bvits. Food is not just a matter of calories, but nutrients are crucial.I was told in 1986 by my current endocrinologist that someone put on insulin who is T1 will be totally dependent within 5 years and he told me that when I was already at 5 years and I was FAR from totally dependent so I did even more researching into supplements, which is the best tactic going. I lived across the street from a health store, thank God!!!! Prior to that all I did was walk and bike. I hardly cooked as I lived alone. That was before the Internet which I had help from only 11 years later.So do all you can to minimize the exhaustion of your ability to make insulin. You do not go from OK to nothing overnight. One of the worst approaches of doctors is to ignore giving the push to eating vegetables as they are not nutritionists and people FAIL miserably at taking advice to eat better.They send you to a dietician and it seems most people will ignore even what they suggest.This is not an issue of a diet to lose weight. Even a full cup of chopped broccoli a day is not enough chromium as it would be 1/3 of the RDA yet it is one of the better sources, but it also depends on the soil it is grown in.",Feb '14

I always had to turn off my low alert at night (so that it would only wake me up at below 55) and even with that: the first night of a new sensor it often thinks I’m dying and that I’m am below 45 or it’ll just say LOW!
My solution for those first nights, was to go to bed with higher sugars than normal… and worst-case: I’d turn off my G6 receiver.
I recently switched from a Medtronic 530 to a t-slim X2 and have been loving it! Since my first night on it in July, my sugars have been perfectly flat at night every single night 
However, on my last sensor, I had a really bad Dexcom compression low and I couldn’t turn off my receiver because it’s now part of my pump!
Has anyone else ran into this?

Put your pump in a faraday bag (check Amazon).  This blocks data from transmitter to pump.

Go into pump menu for cgm settings.  Change one digit of transmitter id and save.

When disecting a problem, check 4ME according to kaizen (or continuous improvement).
Man
Machine
Method
Material
Environment
Look at each of those and analyze your situation.  You should NEVER compromise your safety by turning off alarms.    You should read more about compression lows.  Here is my spin on compression lows.
BACKGROUND: Compression lows are caused by the person’s body pressing against the mattress, pinning the CGM sensor/transmitter (CGM) between the person’s body and the mattress during sleep. First, the interstitial fluid (IF) is the fluid around body cells. Most of the time IF is exchanged with fluids in the blood vessels. During this exchange, IF glucose is enriched and cellular waste products are removed from the IF all over the body.
THE PROBLEM: When a person is in sound sleep and is mashing the CGM into the mattress, the IF is also mashed. It is this mashing or compressing of the IF that causes the IF not to exchange as it normally does. Since the cells around the CGM sensor wire continue to consume (eat) the glucose available in the compressed area around the sensor wire the glucose in the area drops.
OBSERVATION: It is this low reading in the CGM data is usually seen as a nearly level data graph and then a sudden drop of the glucose level. Because it is a low brought about by the pressure on the CGM, the term COMPRESSION LOW has been offered in pumping circles. Because the Compression Low is a low glucose only in the area of the CGM, a finger stick performed in response to a LOW alarm will show NORMAL. The variation between the finger stick and the CGM data leads to frustration and bewilderment, believing technology is the source of the error.
The next observation is the blood sugar measured by the CGM will return to a value near where the CGM line was before the drop in CGM value. The near level line, the drop & alarm, the finger stick of different reading, and the return to the near pre-alarm value is the full picture of the COMPRESSION LOW.
Here is a link to an article from the US National Library of Medicine on the subject.

3170,Managing Low Carb diet side effects,Type 2,Lauren78,,"I was initially diagnosed with GD at 13 weeks with my first pregnancy. It didn’t fully go away after birth, I still had high postprandial blood sugars, I managed it with diet. Second pregnancy I was on insulin in my first trimester. After my second pregnancy, it seemed to go away. I had repeated A1Cs that were 5.0, the last one was in August. A few weeks ago I noticed some symptoms, exhausted, constantly hungry, thirsty a lot, suddenly gaining weight after my weight being pretty stable for almost 2 years (since the second baby). Sure enough, my fasting blood sugar is now over 100 (postprandial seems ok, basically the opposite of how it was before ). I had a lot of testing early on, because my family history and presentation made me “atypical.” So I know I’m negative for MODY 1-5. As of almost 5 years ago I was negative for ICA, GAD and 1 other antibodies, and c-peptide was normal. Three years ago my fasting insulin was low (<2.0) but my fasting blood sugar was 91 so that doesn’t necessarily mean anything.
I have an appointment next week, but long story short, it looks like Prediabetes. Ok, so I need to go back to a low carb diet. I’ve done it before, I know how, and I can stick to it.

@Robyn_H‘s explanation is very good. Our phones, laptops, and tablets are not accurate because of some magical precision, but because they “check in” with international time standards multiple times per day for a correction. As a result, they always appear to be perfect … although, in reality, even they are fractions of a second off at time until their next correction.
Stand alone electronics …  a thing with a computer in it … has a master “oscillator” in it that becomes the main clock signal that drives the computer or, in this case, insulin pump.  You might have a computer that has a 5 GHz clock speed … which means that it likely has an oscillator in it that runs at a frequency of 5 GHz.
Of course, our pumps have a computer that serves as it’s brains … but it is not nearly as fast as you laptop, particularly since it needs to run for several days on a battery charge.
I have no idea what speed the processor in our pump runs at, but is is probably much slower than 5 GHz. Let me pretend that it is 100 MHz (that is, 100 million cycles per second. So, if you have a circuit that does nothing but count clock cycles, and then resets to zero, every time it reaches 100,000,000, then you have a nice, accurate one second interval. Problem solved! Perfect time keeping!
Except, due to manufacturing tolerances, the oscillator in your pump probably doesn’t run at PRECISELY 100.00 MHz. Suppose it runs at 99.99 MHz, then it takes a very small fraction of a second LONGER than one second for that circuit to count to 100,000,000. So what it thinks is a second is actually about 1/10,000 longer than a second. Since there are 86,400 seconds in a day, a clock frequency that is only 0.01% slow will actually lose 8.6 seconds per day. If your computer clock is slightly faster than my mythical 100 MHz, then it will actually gain time.
Computer lesson over … you all get A grades in my class.

@Timothy:
Yes, I think that this is the obvious solution. However, if I look at the way that the Tandem t:connect phone app behaves, I can’t acknowledge an alarm on my phone and have it “clear” it on the pump. This leads me to believe that the BLE communication is currently only broadcasting from pump to phone but not listening to responses from the phone.
I’m hopeful, however, that an updated version of both the pump software and the t:connect phone app WOULD allow two way communications because it would be really nice to clear pump  alarms from your phone. At that point. it should be easy for the pump to ask: “ Mr. Phone, what time is it?”
Of course, since I have no inside knowledge of the exact communications between phone and pump, I may be completely wrong about one way vs two way communications between pump and phone.

3198,When Diabetes Devices Fail,Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,1,"Unfortunately, the MAUDE database isn’t very intuitive or user friendly.  It’s also limited to US events, so it’s not comprehensive.
When I was choosing my first pump 3 years ago, I spent nearly 6 weeks reading through the reports I found.  Not many people are willing to read those reports, or could comprehend the language.
I’m surprised that this is enlightening for the previous posters, though.  I consider you both to be exceptionally well-informed.  What part exactly was surprising?  Did you not know there was a database of events related to medical equipment, or just not that it was publicly available and searchable?  Is it just the volume of significant events that occur.
Honestly, the public has misplaced trust in the FDA.  They assume that the FDA stamp on something means it’s proven safe, and there’s very little about establishing safety at all.  That’s why drugs all come with a mile long list of side effects, usually ending with something like “anal hemorrhaging, and/or death”.  You have to establish that something is generally safe, but aside from that, it’s just about establishing your marketing with impressive clinical trials, paying the government it’s due, and internal lobbying power.
Heck, you can flat out buy an FDA stamp to put on your marketing.  A device can be “FDA listed” with little to no scrutiny whatsoever, so long as your check clears.  You think the general population knows the difference between “FDA listed”, “FDA cleared”, and “FDA approved”?  Heck no! Their eyes glaze over and they forego any further questioning the moment they see the “FDA”.",26d

That said, I was still surprised about the laxity. Maybe I assumed the long times to market meant the devices were being vetted properly, but it seems less so than I believed, and obviously there are few after-market controls.
In the end, this isn’t a complete change for me, just that I need to set the bar a little lower, take a slightly dimmer view of the industry, and keep a more watchful eye.",25d

With MDI you can mis-dose yourself, but as far as the system itself goes there’s not a whole lot that can go wrong. There just aren’t that many components: Vial + syringe, or pre-filled injector + tip, and that’s it. The only failure point is really the human brain—operator error.
With a basic, standard pump, just off the top of my head:

Pump hardware: battery fail, mechanical failure (e.g., “frozen button” syndrome)
Infusion set and reservoir: inset rip-outs (can be unnoticed), bent canula on insertion, bad insertion location, 3-day limit, non-delivery due to kinked tubing or other cause.
CGM: bad or erratic sensor, blue tooth drop outs, sensor filament stuck under the skin, filament impinges on muscle sheath (ouch!), transmitter battery failure
Operator error: opportunities multiplied here as well. Numerous decision points that can be gotten wrong, or parameters shift due to metabolic changes: basal rate settings, bolus types that can be mis-applied (normal, square wave, dual wave), forgetting to restart after “suspend,” etc etc.

Hybrid system paradox: this was really brought home to me when I tried using the 670G. The ideal they’re working toward is something that acts like a functional pancreas, i.e., a black-box device that functions in a way you don’t have to think about, just like a real pancreas. But in practice, at least in Medt’s initial version, that entails locking parameter controls away from the user (black box!), while adding new potential failure points because the monitoring, feedback systems and insulins just aren’t really quite there yet (particularly the insulins). This can result in the worst of both worlds: it’s not working as well as the non-hybrid, the various fail-safes keep kicking in in ways that force you to have to jump to it’s tune rather than the other way around, and you can’t change things on your own to better adapt to your individual profile. The next iteration—Tandem’s Control IQ and the forthcoming 780G—seems to be evolving toward handing back more of the controls to the patient so you can dial it in to your particular metabolism. That seems a much better compromise given the current state of tech. You still have to know a lot about the principles behind everything in order to get the best performance, but once you do that it can perform more like a set-it-forget-it system.",15d

When you add complexity you add failure points. With MDI you can mis-dose yourself, but as far as the system itself goes there’s not a whole lot that can go wrong.


I agree with this sensibility about potential failure points and would add that (for me), the principal reason mdi works so well is because of a cgm (I mean, sure I could use strips 20x/day, but realistically, that isn’t as likely as looking at my phone every half hour), so the cgm potential failures can apply to the mdi model as well.

3216,Night hypos due to evening exercise,Food,pancreaswanted,,"Hello all,
I am having a problem with overnight hypos, at all times of the night-sometimes between the typical midnight to 3am slot, but also later on towards dawn.
I do my exercise in the evening, most of the time a run, a long walk, dynamic (not relaxing) yoga or training session with my running group, lasting an hour and a half of strength and sprint/series/changes of rhythm runs. I finish between 7pm and 830pm.
I get home, shower and have dinner, which is always 100gr of full-fat, Greek yoghurt with walnuts. (I live in Spain, we eat a bigger lunch and smaller dinner, also aiming, with help of a shrink, to never skip any meals and we decided this dinner I can do-bit of disordered eating going on, but working on fixing it.)
I have lowered my basal from .85-.80 from midnight to 0230am on the advice of my endo and if my bg is on the low side, under 100, i will lower my basal to 80% for the whole night, but if it is 150 going to bed, like last night, I don´t want to put a lowered basal. (Sometimes I finish very intense workouts high.)
I am looking to see if anyone else exercises at this time and has these problems with hypos and if you have a specific food that you eat that helps combat them. the yogurt has the three macronutrients and the walnuts are fat and some protein, so I am expecting them to keep me high enough to go through the night if I can´t lower the basal when I am higher at bedtime. Or just further experiment with lowering basal.
Thanks in advance!",Nov '20

It would probably be something that they have as a snack before bedtime-most people in other countries maybe have dinner earlier.

@pancreaswanted  You could try cheese and crackers (carbs) or salami (protein).

I think that the primary variable at play is HOW MUCH vaccine is available at any given time. I think that they will attempt to do a group of people in their entirety.

Doesn’t sound like your alarms are all set to off.  Can you put up a screenshot of your dexcom alert setting screen?  There are a couple of places you have to change it, the “always sound” isn’t the master control I don’t think.  The only one that should sound is the one under 55, but nothing else.

If you don’t want that many alerts, you may have to relax the rule somewhat.  So for example if you have the high alert set too low, then it is of course going to alert you earlier than you would want.  Its a bit of a balance and different for each person depending on the sugar control level they want to achieve and the level they currently have.
If you are currently always running high then perhaps it means your dosage isn’t correct and you should be addressing your dosage.  But if its alarming but really you are not that high, then perhaps your high value is set too low and you are being fatigued by the annoying warnings which sounds to be your case.

Stop your sensor session, or wait until it’s expired and stops on it’s own.
Remove transmitter, as explained above.
Go ahead and wipe the electrodes (metal dots) in both the exposed sensor and the transmitter with alcohol and let it dry while waiting.
Set timer for at least 15 minutes, I set it for 16 to be safe.
After timer elapsed, reinsert the transmitter.
Start new sensor session.  If you happen to know your sensor code, enter it.  (Those of us who restart sensors save the code.  I take a picture of the lot number on the box and the paper sensor code every time I insert a new sensor.)  If you don’t have the code anymore, that’s okay.  Don’t assume it’s the same as any other in your box. Just tap the “no code” option during the startup. Without the code, you’ll be prompted to calibrate twice immediately at sensor start, and then twice a day thereafter, just like with the G5 system, but it’s better than not having CGM data.
If you were able to start it using the sensor code, it will probably reas really high at first.  Go ahead and calibrate right away.  Because it reads high, it’s best to aim to have your sugar around 100mg/dl when the sensor warmup expires, because they’re prone to errors if you try to make too big of a calibration or try to calibrate while out of range.

I think you’re right about lifetime correlating with BG, but for me it correlates with mean BG over the session more than ups and downs.

3316,More than a little suprised,Treatment,Rphil2Type 1 or LADA,,"This practice is called non medical switching.  It is like, but not really like, using a generic for a name brand pill.
In this case it is the exact same insulin.  Your insurance company has made an economic decision to use the lesser cost.
Here is where it breaks down.  Suppose there were two products  functionally the same.  But not identical in make up.  This would be called a biosimilar.  Humalog and Novolog are bio similar, functionally the same but different.
Now recall that most people in our community get very upset if the insurance company changes formulary and the company is changed.  Well in the bio medication community A change might be truly devastating.  in today’s world Bio-Similar companies are now making a large swath of of very expensive medications.
For instance, my RA medication has a list price of 25K per administration with 6 doses per yea.r  $125K.  when  bio similar comes on the market it will likely cost about 80K per year.  A large incentive to switch.
But since i never see the vial i might never know what i got, if I am not informed before hand.  In fact i might not know what it I received ever.
For that reason those us who use these medications we are demanding that non medical forced switching not be allowed.    It goes like this if a docotr prescribes differently then fine, that is a medical reason.  If not then switching cannot be be done unless our doctor and we agree.
We ask for general support for our position.  We know that someday Humalog and Novolog may be biosimilar insulin, but eventual insulin will be more broadly produced.  After all if the biosimilar manufacturers have set up to make RA medications. they can certianily produce bio similar insulin.  Please help us stop non medical switching)

When you take off every pod, I recommend that you carefully examine the cannula to see if the tip is kinked.
How many units of insulin do you deliver in a day? Higher delivery rates have been known to cause irritation at the cannula tip for some. This may lead to an immune response and swelling and can block or resist insulin absorption.
Some people resort to changing their pods every 48 hours instead of every 72 hours. Many pod users report a BG rise on their third day, something I call “third day fade.”

Now if I reach 180 on my pod I switch it out. I am never at 180 anymore unless I am asleep with DP or I made a really obvious error like forgetting to take insulin or rebound from exercise a couple of times. But those times have an explanation.  I am much happier switching it out sooner than waiting to see if it keeps up.
The ones that are harder to spot are if you keep wanting to hang around 140. I don’t usually stay at 140, but I do go up to 140 sometimes. But if I notice I keep wanting to be at a higher average all day, I switch the pod out. Hidden infections or maybe stress situations can cause higher BG levels, but more often than not it’s a pod (or podsite) not working like it should.
I take a correction shot whenever I switch it out to make sure I get some insulin. But I actually had 2 pods in a row a couple of times, but again if I reach 180, it gets switched and I take an MDI shot.

PLEASE don’t say it is 1/5 of the total, per hour


Back before pumps calculated insulin on board (IOB), I learned how to use manually calculated insulin corrections that considered IOB. Since this was all “back of an envelope” street math, I used the crude linear analysis of 1/5 of the total insulin being used per hour. I was aware of the imprecision but its simplicity helped me during this time.
This is something John Walsh recommended in one of his earlier book editions back in the '90s. It worked well enough for me but I’m more than happy to now use the more precise calculations produced by calculus equations that live in my diabetes devices.",May '19

Since my AM bolus varies by up to a couple of units, I need to be a bit more “scientific” about the expected time it takes me to drop to 110-115, so that I can set a timer on my phone instead of glancing over and over again at the CGM.  I get busy doing other things and don’t always look at the point that I’ve hit the range I want.   Make sense?

I think it’s the same graph. Looking at the baseline, I’d say all but a small amount of Humalog activity is gone by hour 4. I know that’s what my endo told me.
I agree that using a simple square wave (1/5 per hour for 5 hours) is all but worthless. The curve shows thats just not true. You can probably ball-park estimate the activity by hour using the curve.
At least for me, my physical activity level has a huge impact on the insulin timeline. When I’m sedentary it takes what seems like hours before I see a significant response to a bolus. When I’m very active I can see a significant response in just a few minutes. Just another variable to deal with.",May '19

If you’re interested in the BG drop during your pre-bolus time, then that would be a simple calculation. If you took a 10 unit meal dose (round number for illustrative purposes), during the first hour, 10% of the total insulin dose (1 unit) would drop your pre-dosing BG by 30 mg/dl (1.7) using your ISF of 30. During the second hour your BG would continue to drop another 60 mg/dL or 3.3 mmol/L (20% of 10 units = 2 units and ISF of 30).
I’m using the chart numbers I cited above and this is an ideal analysis and doesn’t account for any other outside influences like exercise or dawn phenomema. A basal rate set too high or low would also distort this analysis.",May '19

To make a very long story short I started swelling from my belly down to my feet of 40lbs of water weight. I would take lasix and urinate it off and three days later it came back like click work. I went to every specialist you could think of had MRI’s CAT Scans of all my organs. Doctors kept passing me off to other doctors. Then I had a very traumatic event happen in my life and I did not eat for a week. Therefore I did not use insulin and mostly slept 24/7. During that week, no swelling! So a month later I tried again fasting for a week. Same result no swelling. So I knew it was the insulin. Went to allergy doc and she confirmed I was allergic to the components in long acting insulin. So Endo doc said I am not a type 2 but a type 1 bc my pancrease is producing very little insulin. So he put on Tandem pump with Novalog. I started that this past October 4th 2020. Before my pump I was injecting my novalog and had little tiny bruises at injection site on my thighs. None on my stomach just thighs and a little swelling. Didn’t think much of it. So after two weeks on pump my right upper thigh has a bruise that dsarts at top of my thigh and trails down to my knee area. My left outter thigh had bruises all where I use to give injections and upper front if thigh. Its been two months now with pump and I ended up in hospital four weeks ago with chest arm and leg pains. Did a heart cath and my heart is perfectly fine. I have been in bed now with major anxiety attacks, pain in chest arms and legs major thurst headache dizziness. All signs of reaction to Novalog. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I have a phone appt with my Endo’s PA tomorrow. I’m so tired of being in bed this is not me. If I take half a mg of xanex the anxiety feeling goes away. I’m a very active pettit person who mever really sits down always up doing something but this is kicking my butt.

Tammy,  Welcome to TuDiabetes.  Your post is very complex.  I want to see if there are things that stand out.  Please correct any points in error.

fluid retention that resolved when long acting insulin removed.
suffered traumatic life event, fasted a week, used little insulin, & had no swelling.
started Novolog by pump 4 Oct 20.
previously, injected Novolog in to thighs with tiny bruises.
injected Novolog to stomach was bruise free.
pump site in thigh after two weeks was bruised with tracking.
clinical picture is causing stress with hospitalization in early November.
heart cath clear.
Novolog aggravating situation.

Questions:

What is reason for using thighs instead of belly for pumping?
Have you discussed the preservatives and other components with your PHARMACIST?
Did your allergy doc check for components of Novolog?
Do you have a list of the suspect components?
Are any of those components in other insulin’s formulation?
Have you consulted a holistic medical prationer?

Tammy, may I also suggest you check out the forum at JDRF.  It is a dot org site.  There are some great people over at the JDRF forum.

For me, it clearly depends on one variable: the ripeness of the banana.
IF the banana is really ripe, then it’s like eating pure sugar. If the banana is not so ripe (i.e. hard), I just bolus for the correct amount of carbs (20g for a small banana, 35g for a large banana).

As the fruit ripens, the starch is converted into readily available sugars.”
So basically, in my almost green bananas, there are “resistant starches” that I do not digest (and hence do not raise my blood sugar). Whereas I digest all the carbs from ripe bananas.

(many times that first stick will bleed a bit afterwards, so i am glad i did not bother to insert there.) unfortunately, sometimes , after a day or so w/ my MM pump site, i will see a bit of blood around the canula. i realize i am not getting the best insulin absorption either. so i take it out and re-do it. it is a pain in the a** , but take it out anyway and start over.

as far as the sensor placement goes, it is more of a challenge b/c the sensor placement area is larger. i do continue from time to time to get the gushers, but it is rarer than it used to be. basically, i have had to leave the abdomen area completely with my sensor placement and move on to other, “fattier” areas, like my hips, thighs, butt, arm…i just don’t seem to be able to have any success whatsoever with my abdomen area.

I’ve been using the Mio infusion sets for the past 4 years (the only pump I’ve had) but Medtronic keeps suggesting that I try the Silhouettes specifically because they are angled but I don’t see how that would help me since if it’s a capillary issue, it’s still going to hit it. 6mm Mio cannula or 13mm angled won’t change much.
The last Medtronic rep suggested trying the Sure-T Infusion Set, but that terrifies me.
I’ve been Type 1.5 for 5 years and was a total needlephobe before then… The Mio and G4 inserter make my needle phobia a lot less of an issue than when I used to do MDI 5 years ago.

no, bort269, i am not talking about the veins, just the tiny capillaries beneath the first layer of your skin. you have to look for them under bright light, but they are there. thats most likely what you’ve been hitting. and even though they are small they pack a mean and nasty punch for spurting blood. also, i am on the MM silhouette, but my canulla/introducer needle are both straight. i have very little problem sliding them under the skin on an angle…maybe a 45 degree angle in order to get it just under the skin, so i don’t hit any nerves or muscle.

@SherryAnn
For Medicare to consider a system to be DBE, there must be a component of that system which is intended to last a period of time which I recall is generally a 3 year time frame.
Obviously the PDM would appear to fit this definition in terms of the Insulet Omnipod system.  The issue is the PDM was coded by CMS (or the PDAC contractor) as E0607 - Home glucose monitor.
Insulet tried to change this coding in 2010 and was denied.  Without this - there is no DME and without DME there is no Part B coverage.",Nov '18

I did have problems getting an adequate supply of test strips, but that was because of the (family) doctor; the doctor has to follow the health system regulations as part of his or her contract and, as non-specialists, individual doctors can be somewhat inflexible.
Anyway I think that is moot now with CGMs; the PM (LADA) is using a Libre and there isn’t any special health system for MPs, unlike here.
I was considering swapping to the Animas Ping this year because I was getting fed up with the Omnipod water proofing and the overall clunkiness of the system.  Obviously that got nixed when Animas dropped out of the NA market but that’s not a problem in the EU.
Anyway, Medicare is the best we have - my insurance company cancels their policies at the end of every year and comes up with new ones that I have to apply for.  This year they cancelled my HSA eligible plan and wanted to enroll me in on that wasn’t HSA eligible.  That  could have cost me as much as $3500 extra (depending on my marginal tax rate - US+OR).

A lot of bright people born in Nov.!
We all give deserved thanks to Dr’s Banting, & his research associate Dr. Best for the discovery.
I did not know research biochemist Dr. James Collip was brought in to refine the discovered insulin extract such that it was actually injectable without adverse reaction.
Such an amazing, complicated mystery to resolve. Peers working together to try to crack a centuries old challenge of diabetes.
Imagine if governments would do the same: work together towards a solution.
Happy Birthday Dr. Collip.

3477,BS going up 2 hours after waking,Type 2,blizzard2014,,"I have been noticing that when I wake up earlier in the morning that my initial fasting sugars are sometimes in the high 90’s, like today. Then 2 hours later I feel numb hands and some minor lightening zaps in the hands, re-check the BG and it is 181. I only drink coffee with Splenda and not even a cup of milk. I had only drank half the cup by the time I checked my BG again. I know one cup of milk has 13 grams of carbohydrates, but that is hardly enough to cause my BG to go to 181. I also notice that if I wake up later with a BG of 130/140 and just wait an hour or two, it will also climb even higher. This can happen even without the coffee. I’m still only eating 1 large meal a day and always go to bed with BG under 100, but never higher than 130. I work nights, so I usually get up in the afternoon. What’s the point of even trying to behave and control this disease if it just does whatever the heck it wants to do? What do you guys suggest other than going Keto? I have even worse morning numbers on nights when eating just a salad with chopped ham and un-breaded chicken wings with some blue cheese dressing. This is really starting to test my resolve.

No sugar added, just a small amount of carbs from the blue cheese dressing and nothing more. My morning fasting numbers were the same. Every morning 140/180, even when eating a small snack of a few wings before going to bed. Then the forth night I have a large pizza, 80 units of insulin and have a 120 fasting the next day.

3479,BS going up 2 hours after waking,Type 2,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,4,"First there is DP which is dawn phenomenon, it’s a release of hormones usually  around 5-6 am that raises your BG levels in preparation for the day. Then there is what we call FOTF which is sort of the same thing but literally after you put your feet on the floor you get a BG boost. You can test DP by setting your alarm and testing at 4:30-5 am and your BG probably hasn’t increased yet.
The only thing that can be done about it is to take extra insulin just to combat it, Some people wait until they get up and give a shot first thing. Some people say a keto diet can help, but that doesn’t work for a lot of people.
The easiest way is to get an insulin pump, mine isn’t as bad as it used to be and sometimes I don’t barely have it anymore, but I used to set my pump to deliver 3x my normal hour dose between 5-7 am. Now I need just a slight nudge more. But I have another nudge that starts when I first get up.
This hormone release also causes insulin resistance, you need more insulin in the am for anything you eat or to bring down your numbers. Frankly it was easier for me just not to eat in the am and I still usually don’t.
Coffee, probably because of the caffeine, causes a lot of peoples BG to rise even though there is no carbs in it. And sugar alcohols cause an increase in Bg’s in some type 1’s but not everyones.",Jan '20

I’m still only eating 1 large meal a day and always go to bed with BG under 100


My initial guess is that 1) you are eating that 1 meal within 4 hours of going to bed.  If so, eat that meal a lot earlier where your daily activities will work off some of the glucose and calories.  Try to eat that big meal at least 10 hours before going to bed.  2) Look at how many carbohydrates you are eating in that big meal.  Forget about Keto, just start cutting the carbohydrates by 25% to start and keep cutting them down until you are at about maximum 50 grams of carbs for that big meal.

It doesn’t matter if I only drink coffee or have a cup of water. Upon waking I take 2 units of insulin to combat the high blood sugar.

I have been just injecting between 10 and 12 units every morning right when I wake up. That usually leaves my blood sugar at 100 -110 a few hours later. One day it was 80, and yesterday on ten units it was 70 and had to eat a piece of candy before work, because if it is low when I go to work and still within the 4 hour period of taking insulin, I will drop low. If I was just going to sit at home a 70 is fine. I’m saving on test strips because I just inject and only check before work a few times a week.

Mix everything up with the nuts and either (a) divide the total carbs by the number of bags you fill, or (b) divide the total weight (or volume) by the weight (or volume) of your serving, and derive the carbs from that.

In my daily reading I do about diabetes and health, I have come across an eating tactic for diabetes that made zero sense to me yet people with type 1 diabetes claim it works very well for them. They say that the key is minimizing fat so that your body can greatly increase its insulin sensitivity and enable the insulin you do take to metabolize more carbs. This diet includes no meats.
My initial take on this whole idea was extreme skepticism, but I keep running across different cases where people are claiming that it not only helps with their blood sugar control, but they also feel healthy in a comprehensive way. My thinking now is, given the variety of human metabolisms, this high-carb low-fat or HCLF can work in some people.
I would love to see some blood sugar CGM graphs of people who advocate and use this diet so I can see hard evidence that this diet matches the glowing narrative they write.

This amazes me. I wonder if this phenomena holds true with a wide swath of diabetics or is simply occurs due to a spectrum of human metabolism performance.
If you occasionally slip some higher fat content into your eating routine, does that immediately degrade your insulin to high carb ratio or is this metabolic measure slow to change?
Considering your insulin to carb ratio (I:C) hinted at with possibly 500 grams of carbs being metabolized with 10 units of insulin (guessing 1/2 of 20 units total daily dose), then your I:C is an astounding 1:50. Is that true for you or any others who use LFHC as a way of eating?
I know when I adopted a LCHF way of eating there were many people who remained skeptical that this could work and didn’t want to try it for themselves. This is still true today. I guess I would have to read many more accounts of long term blood glucose success with this way of eating before I might give it a try. I am enjoying great BG control with my current LCHF way of eating and it takes very little to no willpower to sustain.
Thanks for reporting your experience. If any of you who enjoy this way of eating (LFHC), I would love to see some post-meal BG graphs traced by a CGM or even a series of fingersticks. Seeing this kind of anecdotal evidence would be persuasive to me.",Aug '18

I don’t eat HCLF, more like moderate carb (~100g) and moderate fat, but I have noticed a difference in my insulin dosing based on how much fat I eat. With LCHF my I:C ratio is about 1:5, but on a lower fat diet it’s about 1:15. For me it takes a couple days of eating low fat for my insulin sensitivity to improve, but only a high fat meal or two to see an increase in insulin resistance.

Could you be more specific about how you want to use the phone with Dexcom equipment? Do you wish to use a Dexcom app on the phone to connect to a Dexcom sensor? Or do you just want to “follow” the results of someone else’s sensor?
In either case, the first thing to do is go to the Dexcom site and check their compatibility list. I say this because Dexcom’s mobile app will not work on my Motorola Moto G7 running Android 10. Sure you can install it. But when you run it a message pops up saying it is not support on the phone it is running on.

What are you using for a phone now?  Why is it not an option to use it with Dexcom?  Are you currently an Android or an Apple user?  I highly recommend Android if you’re not already committed to Apple, as it allows you many more freedoms and options.
I’m going to second @Timothy .  Get a used one!  Check both craigslist and the Facebook Marketplace.  If you buy local you can get a good look at the phone before you buy it and not spend a small fortune in shipping.  A lot of people buy the latest and greatest every year, and resell their excellent condition phone for a fraction of the cost of new.
Look for a used phone with minimal signs of wear.  Scratches are fine if they don’t bother you, but don’t buy one with a broken screen with the intention of replacing the screen.  Screens are expensive, and if you can’t do the work yourself, so is repair shop labor.  Make sure it has either Android version 9 (pie) or 10 installed, preferably 10 as it will be supported longer.  Anything older won’t likely get security updates.  I don’t know enough about Apple to make a recommendation there.
I wouldn’t buy anything until after Christmas, either.  There will big sales clearing out leftover Christmas stock in the stores, if you decide to buy new.  But also, I bet you a lot of used phones come up for sale after so many people unbox a shiny new one Christmas morning.
Don’t worry about Dexcom supported devices.  Once you get a phone, we can help you install either an unrestricted version of the official Dexcom app or you any 3rd party on you want, my favorite being Xdrip+ (only for Android), so much better than the Dexcom app.
As for phone plans…  Definitely go with a reseller.  There is zero point in paying the premium for the big name brands, when the smaller companies resell the same exact product at a better price.

I’ve been a T1 since 1999 and I’ve only just now been able to afford to get a pump. I’m waiting for a Dexcom CGM to come, but, in the meantime, I’m just using my TSlim X2 pump. My endocrinologist started me off taking way less insulin than I need. We got hold of him once and he adjusted it. But, I’m still not getting enough. The thing is, I can’t hardly ever seem to get in touch with him. I’m averaging 220 with my high today around 340. Some days are better than others, but, I know how to change settings, but I’m not supposed to change them before consulting him, but with it so close to the holiday, I dunno if I’ll hear from him, and the nurse at the doctor office said she can’t do anything.

I would have felt better having you start on the CGM, rather than the pump.

I think that this is prob the safest thing to do. But, if you can tolerate running a little high, there is value in only changing one technology at a time.
I, personally, could not tolerate running into the 300’s and would prefer to be on syringe insulin over that.
Since you, like me, are prob pretty hyperglycemia adverse, you need to be super careful about those pump settings without a CGM (especially because of the covid stuff - you can’t have a diabetic LOW BG emergency now). Be careful, man, whatever you decide. I’m a litte superstitious about the holidays and medical emergencies, so I won’t advise you to change those pump settings until either after the new year, or you have a CGM and a weeks worth of data.

Since they want to get some data, I didn’t want to turn off the pump entirely, but I will let him know the amount of Lantus I’ve been using as well. I should get my CGM soon. Going to bug my insurance folks again and see if they’re making any progress on approving the payment.",16d
3591,"New to using pump, struggling with getting help",Diabetes Technology,Terry4,3,"If I understand you correctly, you’re trying to transition to the pump from a multiple daily injection (MDI) regimen that was volatile with swinging glucose levels. I sense the missing ingredient in this effort is the knowledge needed to set up and then adjust pump settings to home in on your optimal insulin needs.
If it was me in your situation, with an unresponsive doctor, I would switch back to your more familiar MDI protocol and back off a little on your dosing. In other words, maybe take a unit or two less of your long-acting insulin and bump up your insulin sensitivity factor (correction ratio) making it less aggressive. For example if your ISF was 1:30 (1 unit drops BG 30 mg/dL) then set it to 1:35 or 1:40.
Even though you do not have your CGM yet, you do have a fingerstick meter. Is that right? If you want to learn about how your body’s glucose metabolism works, then liberally use your meter and keep a hand-written log of the results.
Have you read any books about using insulin? Think Like a Pancreas by Scheiner, Using Insulin and Pumping Insulin by Walsh, and Sugar Surfing by Ponder are all worthwhile books to dig into. While all our modern diabetes technology is wonderful, real long term success using the tech is dependent on your human software.
I understand that you are a T1D. Is your doctor’s practice primarily T2D? If this is true, then he may not be conversant in T1D dosing techniques. T2D is a different disease and requires different tactics. Perhaps your doctor’s non-response is because of a lack of confidence to offer detailed settings advice.
My personal opinion is that it’s an unusual doctor who will provide the close daily feedback needed to get a patient well started on a pump. Even once per week advice is not nearly enough. When I sensed this non-support early in my diabetes career, I decided that my knowledge was paramount and these moment to moment diabetes decisions were best left to me.
Once you gain the needed knowledge, you then gain incredible insight to your unique metabolism. A CGM is fundamental to this effort but many well-timed fingersticks can help a lot while you wait for the bureaucracy to grant you a CGM.
Good luck! Investing time and effort into your diabetes knowledge will pay you valuable dividends over your life. I’ve personally sensed that my knowledge of my glucose metabolism has left my endocrinologists far behind. I’m sometimes a bit shocked at how much my endos don’t know. But then I realize that we diabetics live with our diabetes 24/7/365 and endos are only on the job part-time.",16d

I’m not sure what my doctor’s primary practice is. He has his main practice in a different state, and is only near me once a month for a week or so. But, he’s the only endo near me. So, yeah.
I’ve got a good batch of records that shows I’m consistently higher than I should be. I’m taking a hybrid approach at this point where I’m using the pump and injections.

3594,"New to using pump, struggling with getting help",Diabetes Technology,Terry4,,"@Jakewriter1, congrats on your frequent fingersticks. Keeping a handwritten log will give you insights you may not otherwise see.
In order to do well on a pump, you need to be able to detect a need to change a setting and make that change when it’s needed. Diabetes is dynamic, not static. Here’s are some items where your knowledge needs proficiency.


Temporary basal rates


Extended boluses


Combination boluses (some now, some later)


Testing and setting basal rates (good for defeating dawn phenomena, if needed)


Insulin sensitivity factors, also known as correction ratios (ISF can vary through the day)


Insulin to carb ratios (also can vary through the day)


Understanding IOB, insulin on board


Insulin duration


It could help you while you’re trying to make these adjustments, as you’re learning, to limit your carbohydrate intake. For example, instead of bowl of oatmeal with fruit in the morning, eat bacon and eggs without juice, toast or potatoes. Or a cheese omelette with salsa  or veggies if you don’t fancy meat.",16d
3595,"New to using pump, struggling with getting help",Diabetes Technology,TapestryType 1 or LADA,2,"@Jakewriter1 I’m the opposite of you really, pump wise, I use my pump for my basal and a syringe for bolusing.  Eventually, I’d like to get back to just using the pump, but I’ve been doing this for a few years now.  I was having trouble with absorption and this was the best way to handle it.
I wanted to mention, you could reach out to the author of “Think Like a Pancreas,” as he has a practice which works remotely.  I “bolded” some text so it would stand out better for you.

3600,"New to using pump, struggling with getting help",Diabetes Technology,DrBBType 1 or LADA,2,"I transitioned from basal-bolus MDI to a pump about 10 yrs ago, under the guidance of Joslin. Hoo boy were they incremental about it. Which makes sense, up to a point. A pump is not a one-shot dose of Lantus and you can get into trouble. Which is why these days they shouldn’t even be sold without a CGM as part of the deal, and they weren’t standard-issue back then. So I felt much more dependent on the guidance than I would now. But after about 3 weeks of that I eventually just had to take control and start adjusting my basals myself. That’s when I started getting results in line with my pre-pump numbers only without quite so many hypos to get there.
Lessons learned:

All MDs fear the hypo more than the hyper.
Even endo specialists see way more T2s than T1s, and can be hyper cautious around insulin delivery systems just out of lack of experience. That goes triple if you’re dealing with a GP, which was all I had for the first 20 yrs (see YDFLNCA in the acronyms glossary)
If you’re reasonably careful (lots of finger sticks, alas, since you don’t have a CGM), you should be able to get it better dialed in on your own, and once you do the results should speak for themselves when you finally get back in touch with your endo.  They really can’t expect you to just be on hold for that long given the numbers you’re reporting.
The advice of setting temp basals experimentally and adjusting your settings accordingly seems like a great way to do it.

It really depends on how “cloudy” his cataracts are.  Surgery removes that cloudiness.  Glasses only help to some extent, to help with focus.  The halos will likely stay the same with glasses, where surgery would improve them.
I have had  cataract surgery in both eyes.  I chose to get regular/clear lenses.  New options (more cost) can implant “corrective” lens (IOL) during the cataract surgery.

I have been doing that during the first (larger) part of covid lockdown.
But, in order to bring the bolus dose down into something reasonable/typical for me (2 units/15g), I have to increase the basal to really pretty dangerously high levels.
I’ve been doing the best that I can with those. But, I have had more frequent and more severe lows that I ever have had in 20 years. I’m usually not very scared of lows, but I have become so during covid.

I assume this refers to GI side effects/diarrhea. For what it’s worth, it’s fairly variable how this plays out—I’ve never had any noticeable effects from it. For some folks it’s severe and ultimately not tolerable. For most somewhere in the middle. Worth a try to see where you land.
I tried invokana as a different t2 med option, and would not recommend it. I found, similar  to some other folks’ reports on here, that at first it seemed like a miracle drug. For a few weeks, it was like my control issues were miraculously improved, and I couldn’t break 200 if I tried. That pretty quickly wore off and it basically stopped being effective while continuing to make me more vulnerably to dehydration and yeast infections. Then I had one kidney test result that went from no protein to a lot (like levels indicating moderate kidney disease). Still not sure if that value was a fluke/mistake or what, but that was the last straw. I went off of it, without a major shift in control. Kidneys have been back to perfect since.

In the summer, the onshore wind from the cold Pacific to the very hot Central Valley produces consistent 20+ knot winds. When the tide is flowing in or out underneath the Golden Gate Bridge, peak currents can reach 5-6 knots … and currents are very tricky anywhere in SF Bay. Marine traffic: Oakland is, as I recall, the fourth busiest container shipping port on the west coast.

There are plenty of days with more benign sailing conditions. I would not have attempted to change an infusion set under more gnarly or risky conditions. The autopilot, dependable wind conditions, and clear visibility all made diverting my attention to a safe set change possible.
I sailed SF Bay fairly regularly for 15 years and felt comfortable that I could do a set change easily and in fairly short order.

Just a few notes, though… Go into your appointment forewarned, Apidra is another option similar to FIASP, but it is not Lyumjev.  I don’t know where you are, so Lyumjev might not be approved yet there, and/or your insurance company might make you jump through a few hoops to get it.  If you can’t get Lyumjev yet, and your Endo suggests Apidra, it also had mixed results in the T:slim.  Seems to be 50/50, with half the users reporting occlusions and the other half having no problem. I wouldn’t buy more than 1 bottle of Apidra until you see how it works out for you.
I can’t remember who, but another member here reported solving the occlusion problem by mixing either their Apidra or FIASP with Humalog or Novolog, half and half.  They still saw faster acting insulin than Novolog/Humalog alone, and no longer had the occlusion problem.  If you have any Humalog or Novolog left, maybe give mixing them a try in your pump?
Last note: if you’re using Control-IQ on your t:slim, you can’t change the duration of insulin action to better align with Lyumjev.  (The difference is much more marginal with FIASP and Apidra, so doesn’t matter much here).  The Control-IQ program was written for Humalog or Novolog.  I suspect they’re going to unlock this setting in the next software upgrade, but until then… You will probably notice the pump reports a little more insulin on board than is realistic, since Lyumjev has a shorter tail.

How was the removal process


For me. removal was not bad. Took maybe 10-15 minutes without a lot of fussing by the doc. He was experienced and seemed to have confidence the whole way through that both insertion and removal went according to plan.
Long story I will try to shorten: I actually had 3 sensors. My second sensor was dislodged about a week after insertion (ice hockey) , became infected, had to be replaced. For various reasons, I knocked the infection down with antibiotics and left that abandoned sensor in my arm for 3 more months and had both sensor #2 and sensor #3 removed at the same time.
I still have a scar on each arm though. The scars are about half the size of a raisin so they are noticeable. The scar does not bother me but I expect there are many potential users that would not want to be scarred like that.",27d

Yeah, that’s what I’m afraid of.  There’s only one Endo on my entire half of Colorado, and they’re 100% loyal to Medtronic.  I’m assuming they’re not even considering a sensor competitive to Medtronic.  I was summarily dismissed by them at my second appointment when I came in with a competing pump, even though they were the ones who eventually signed off on the script.   I’m hoing there has, or will be in the future, some changes to the extraction process that minimize the need for experience to be non-traumatic.  My current doctor is so eager to learn about my D-tech, and I’m sure she’d be willing to try.  I’m her only type 1 patient, though, so not too eager to be the guinea pig.  I might be more willing if and when I have a pump that can communicate with the Eversense.

3695,Newly diagnosed Type 1,Welcome,lainey683,,"Hi All - I’m a newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetic and I’m delighted to find this community. I got diagnosed in late October after experiencing recurrent yeast infections - I went into urgent care, which revealed high glucose in my urine, and a finger stick pegged me at 309 ml/dl. I am a 37 year old woman, very active with a normal BMI and a family history of autoimmune disorders. An A1C of 14+ and GAD antibody test confirmed my Type 1 diagnosis.
In hindsight, I really should have noticed that losing five pounds in quarantine, despite eating everything in sight, was too good to be true  I gained 8 pounds in my first week of starting insulin. I feel much better already.
I’ve had initial meetings with an endocrinologist, diabetes nurse, and nutritionist. The nutritionist was really pushing me to eat more carbs. (I went strict keto after my diagnosis and before getting my insulin, then ate low carb, roughly 50-100 net carbs a day, in my first few weeks). I have been trying to eat higher carb these last few weeks (aiming for 200g net carbs/day), but I’ve noticed poorer sugar control as a result.
I’m currently using Levemir as my long acting, and Humalog for fast acting, along with a Freestyle Libre meter. I just started a new job where I’ll have better health insurance, and so I’ll likely get a Dexcom and possibly a pump early next year.
Everything is a bit overwhelming right now - blood sugar seems to be affected by so many different variables. I’m a bit of a data nerd and very willing to comply with the right diet, but I feel like there’s so much to tackle at once. Every day seems to be an unrepeatable experiment - even my basal insulin needs seem to vary daily with things like my menstrual cycle.

This advice just seems wrong for a diabetic, consuming large amounts of carbs makes controlling blood glucose more difficult for many of us. No one says you must avoid carbs like the plague, make your own choices about how much you wish to consume, taking into account how well you can control the blood glucose that comes with them.

In the long term, most folks will say to try and limit carbs- it definitely makes control much easier.
You are 100% correct with this statement:  “Every day seems to be an unrepeatable experiment”. I’ve never heard it stated more clearly! T1 is a moving target. You’ll always be adjusting and tweaking insulin, and you’ll make a LOT of mistakes. Just be ready for it, and know that its not easy.

Yeah, they kinda have a set diet plan that they start people on.
Are they telling you to deliver the same amount of insulin at each meal?
They are prob just trying to get you through this period of adjustment.

When I started following Dr Bernstein about 15 yrs ago almost NOBODY was eating low carb. Slowly this way of eating has caught on. I followed Dr.Bernstein for 11 yrs and think that he is great, BUT, this way of eating made me very, very ill. My Alc was 4.6, my HDL was 100, but my LDL was close to 200. I am well aware that some people don’t think high LDL matters, but it did for me. While on Bernstein’s woe I suddenly needed two heart stents. I had had very few diabetic complications at this time after 52 yrs of diabetes. That was 10 yrs ago. I also developed very low blood pressure and severe migraines. My husband called an ambulance several times because I would pass out and hit my head.
Since being on a low fat plant based diet, my LDL is way down and I no longer pass out and I have had 1 migraine in 4 yrs.
PLEASE don’t discourage people from finding out about low fat, plant based diets.
I think the  low carb diet works well for many people and it did for me until it didn’t, but some people can be harmed by this way of eating. A high carb diet with low fat is a very healthy way to eat. People have fewer heart problems and cancer.
Yes, it takes a while to adjust, but the change over is fairly easy to make. It also requires exercise, which is great for all of us.
Because eating a very low fat diet greatly lowers insulin resistance, I take almost the same amount of insulin now as I did when eating very low carb. A total of 23 units daily.",11d

It’s not really even low carb.
Your doctor suggests 200. That’s a lot of carb. Even for a non diabetic.
It is doable if you dose correctly and you are getting g lots of exercise.

No cgm I would do finger sticks while running. Sweat mixing in w blood. No idea how I managed.

3712,How often did you test c-peptide & antibodies?,Type 1 and LADA,JM12,,"I’ve read that some people here present negative on antibodies at first, then later on, present positive. I’m curious for those who took a while, how often did you test antibodies? I’m wondering if, considering my results, it would be worth it to retest again.
Quick background: I’ve been experiencing problems with blood sugar for the past 7 months. I get postprandial spikes over 200 and sometimes have rebounds that go as low as 50. This is new for me; I did not experience fluctuations like this a year ago.
I originally got everything lab tested over 3 months ago at the beginning of August. FBG 90 and hba1c 5.2 (so that’s normal as I expected). I took an OGTT which showed 233 at 1 hour and 50 exactly at the 3rd hour. I did another OGTT with insulin which showed I made a below average amount of insulin, and same glucose response. C-peptide at the time was 0.6. No antibodies though. (Slim male. I exercise 4x/week. I eat very healthy, and gluten free btw because I do have Celiac).
For the past month, my FBG has been higher (ranges 98-106 in the morning, when previously I used to be in the mid-80s to low 90s). I realize this could just be the dawn phenomenon (well what it looks like for a very early stage LADA at least). So I decided to retake the c-peptide. I intentionally carbo-loaded heavy for the 4 days leading up to the test (definitely ate more carbs this time than last time). I got 0.6 again. The literal exact same as last time. I’m considering testing hba1c and antibodies again but I might just wait several more months to save money though.
How often did you test your antibodies? Considering my FBG is up and my c peptide is the same, would you recommend another hba1c / antibodies, or continue waiting?
Don’t get me wrong – I’m not exactly rushing or even wanting to be a diabetic. Diagnostically, I don’t even meet T2 standards (unless you count the 200+ postprandial). But I would like to get this problem under control and have a way to combat these BG spikes. And in my mind, IF I’m early LADA, I’d rather just get this out of the way with.",Nov '20

I could be wrong about that but I believe they might even be at the highest earlier versus later. I have heard of type 1’s that have had diabetes for years that their antibody test can go to zero or almost zero as there is nothing much to attack anymore.
I don’t mean you can’t get antibodies later,  and hence type 1 later. It’s just that if you are having blood sugar issues and it is from the process that starts the destruction of insulin producing cells, you would already have those antibodies.
However there are some strange forms of diabetes out there. One is where you have negative antibodies but you don’t make insulin. My DE is one of those, negative antibodies but doesn’t make any insulin. They have not a clue why. One of those unexplained phenomena. You could fit into this category. I really don’t know how long it takes when this happens to lose all your insulin producing cells.
Sometimes loss of insulin producing cells  can be explained by trauma to the pancreas or steroid use. In both those cases some people can get back the production of insulin over time.
Keep in mind I don’t know what tests you had. There are several antibody tests and a lot of time they just test the most common. The GAD test.

When did c-peptide tests become available?


I was diagnosed in 1982, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a test no more complicated than sticking Testape in my urine and having it turn jet black immediately.
Two years later,I had a C-Peptide test in the 1984, it was part of screening required for enrolling in the DCCT study. That said, I chose not to go into the DCCT study (at the time if you were in the “control” group you were not allowed to do home bg testing, which I was already doing. Very shortly afterwards they changed their tune and allowed home bg testing for all in the study) and I don’t know what the result of the C-peptide test was (presumably it showed I was producing no insulin).",Nov '20

Much like every other post I’ve read about LADA, there was quite a bit of confusion about my diagnosis over a span of 5-6 years. Lucky for me my Endo isn’t narrow minded and heavily relied on my input/what was best for me .
Diagnosed as T2 originally five years ago, but as soon as C-peptide and antibody tests came back that quickly switched to T1 (0.5 ng/ml; positive for GAD65 only ). Started MDI, but once I got my basal figured out I was finding I rarely needed to bolus. So I was being well controlled on 10-12 units of Lantus daily . Over the next 6 months I had to keep lowering basal doses due to hypos til eventually had to come off insulin all together . Naturally the “I’m cured” thoughts creep in although you know deep down that isn’t true . This is where I have been over the last 6 years until blood sugars started creeping back up lately which really got my research juices flowing and became convinced  that my case is LADA.  Doc tried pushing various orals , but I respectfully declined and asked to be put back on MDI which has now made things immensely easier to control . C-peptide is still hovering between 0.3-0.5 so it’s still a toss up when the failing pancreas decides it wants to work, but there is an odd sense of relief that with it losing steam things are more predictable.
Crazy the many masks this illness wears and how everyone’s experience can vary drastically, but reading this forum has been such a huge crutch/resource for me when I was trying to get this thing figured out . Until looking deeper into it I never would
have guessed a 6 year honeymoon to be a possibility. Kudos and respect  to all the true Type 1s out there that were completely insulin dependent from the get go . In a way I feel like I got a victory lap and some time to really figure this thing out .",1d

Dexcom was doing extraordinary well in stock investments but recently took a downward hit and projections are iffy.
The freestyle libre 2 is a great competitor now and easier to get covered by insurance. In addition, I think in the UK? You can buy the equipment OTC too.
It’s challenging that we Dexcom users and add pumping too have to order direct or use a specialty pharmacy when the newer products that are becoming more pump friendly are carried by big box pharmacies!

Once that happens, I am quite impressed how accurate the G6 sensors have been during days 2-10.  (And since I sometimes restart a sensor and use it another 10 days, the accuracy continues during days 11-20.)
The important thing is right in the Dexcom user pamphlet – if the Dexcom measurement does not match what you feel or expect, check your meter and re-calibrate if necessary.

While Dexcom replaces each failed sensor after 5-8 days, they refuse to even discuss the reason for the failures of nearly every G6 sensor.

I even logged a tech support request online on August 3, 2020 asking specifically why nearly every sensor has failed. They have not responded. Every time I report a failed sensor, I ask why they continually fail and why my support request has not been answered.

I too have been having problems with my G6.  Up until about two months ago the sensors started failing about seven days in.  The readings would error out for about 3 hours and the cal was off after that.  I’d try a recal and it would go back into error.
Each time it failed after 7 or 8 days of use I called Dexcon to get a free replacement sensor, sometimes they try to kinda get out of it but I keep pretty good notes and didn’t hesitate to mention what and when I noted a problem.  I was firm but nice to them.   I still keep a daily log in excel with 9 or 11 readings through out the day, I record what I eat and record the two insulins intake.  I also note any G6 issues including when I change sensors and xmitter, and record the four digit code of each new sensor and xmitter.
It works great about 70-80 percent of the time and apparently that seems acceptable or within spec with Dexcom.  I don’t think the new style xmitter works as well and there must be an issue with their sensors along with that.  For the price of the equipment, we should get our money’s worth!  I do pre-soak for 12 hr prior to changing over the xmitter.

3770,My Ozempic Experience,Type 2,James_Hurley,,"I found out that I was heading towards Type 2 back in 2016.  I was first put on Metformin which made little difference, especially in my post-meal readings.  My A1C continued to climb and I found out that I was over 8 which scared me quite bad.  My endo added Jardiance, which helped quite a bit, but still wasn’t bringing my numbers down where I’d like them to be.  A few months ago, we decided to add Ozempic.  It’s been a mixed blessing of sorts.
I started with the .25 dose, once weekly, for the first month.  Immediately, I had waves of naseau, mild diarreha and occasional cramping.  About 3 days in, I ate a carb-heavy meal one evening and spent the next two days with incredibly bad diarreha, cramps, and a general feeling that I had an intestinal virus.  No vomiting though.  Immediately, I noticed my numbers were improving dramatically.  Many times, falling below 100 post-meal which I had not see in years.  I also, pretty rapidly, lost 15 pounds and have maintained that weight loss.  I gained 95 lbs over 10 years and truly believe this is where the Type 2 started.  My hope is major weight loss will reverse or put it into remission.
Last week, I upped the dosage to the .5 weekly and have experienced all of the above symptoms over again.  It’s really tough to have near constant diarreha and other GI issues.  If not for the dramatic blood sugar results, I would have long tossed this into the trash. Along with the Metformin and Jardiance, things are changing for the positive but I don’t know how long I can handle the GI issues.

3785,Help! spiking 5-6 hrs after eating and resistance!,Type 1 and LADA,neuroperson,,"Hello!
First time poster here. Im desperate for some help.
Me: 50+ y.o. with LADA (1.5) for about 16 years. First few years easy to manage, last year very difficult
Regimen:

Dexcom 6 for about 6 mo, pretty amazing I think
Long: Lantus 24 u at night,  was never too sure about long acting in general, but sugars a bit more variable during day without it, so I’ve stuck with it. Usually in my gluteus nowadays
Short: Humolog vial with needles, I found the fast acting pens to be difficult as I was never sure how much the pens were giving me. I rotate around my abdomen, could be an issue…
Status HgBA1C is around 8. could be better, could be worse I know.

PROBLEM


For a few months now, my sugar will slowly creep up 200 or more points SLOWLY 4-6 hours after I eat, let say a meal with 30 -45 grams of carbs. It doesnt happen every night either, but “most” nights. I think its more common with a fatty or greasy meal, like a restaurant, but can happen sometimes with a home cooked healthy meal like grilled meat, veggie and a sweet potato, and a small chunk of dark chocolate (like tonight!). My new Endo is thinking could be gastroparesis and will be seeing a GI soon. My previous Endo thought I was giving too much dinner insulin, going low, then having a glycogen release,  but Im not going low, and if I do I dont have a surge unless I overtreat my low, which Im aware of. Any thoughts? We eat around 6 pm and at 11, 12, 1 AM my sugars at at 300-400, which makes NO sense!! The problem does not seem to be as bad for breakfast (yogurt and coffee) or lunch (salad or protien bar)


Also recently, chasing the high sugars with insulin seems to be more difficult then just treating a regular high sugar. I am giving 4-5 unit boluses 3 or 4 times at to bring it down. Using carb counting/adjustment ratio, that is way off for me, I shouldnt have to give my self 15 units to bring me back from 300 to 150, should be more like 5, and its seems to take more like 2+ hours for fast acting to kick in which is oddly long. Is this a related issue? Or a separate issue like abdominal scaring, resistance, etc?


Sorry for the  long post, but Im trying to watch my sugars with the dexom and carb count my meals and the normal rules are not applying and Im scared. Thanks!",Dec '20
3786,Help! spiking 5-6 hrs after eating and resistance!,Type 1 and LADA,Skye,1,"If that were me, that would mean my basal (long-acting) were either not enough or had worn off before the made-up “24 hours” it was pretended to last.
I know they claim Lantus can be a once a day dose, but I am 100% positive (and managed to convince my Dr also) that I only get 18-20hours out of it, and when it wore off, my BG would creep up and up and up- which rudely coincided with  dinner time- and trying to fix my post-meal high by changing my insulin:carb ratio for dinner was ineffective at best and often caused ugly swings (low then high because I had to treat the low but still hadn’t addressed the underlying issue).
Especially if its only a problem after dinner, it might be worth playing with either the timing of your Lantus so if it is wearing off, it wears off a time that doesn’t coincide with a meal or bedtime. I had dramatically better luck splitting my Lantus dose in half and taking it at 9am and 9pm, even though thats not the  official “rules” about how it should work. I am however extremely comfortable adjusting my own doses/ratios/regimens and monitoring to see how -or if!- the changes work, and then readjusting as needed. (I have also switched to Toujeo in the last year or two, and it is WAY more stable for me than Lantus was and my life is all the easier after the switch.)
If this is more common with high fat/high protein meals you can also look into dosing for fat or protein in addition to carbs. Its a little more complicated, but for some people it works really well. The Juicebox Podcast has a few episodes that cover how and why that works, might be worth looking into.
And its SUPER NORMAL to need more insulin (by ratio) to bring down a 300 than to correct a 200 or so. In a really rude feat of biology, being high causes insulin resistance which makes the high harder to bring down which just makes everything a little more challenging. I probably add 20% to the straight math of correcting a 250+ for myself, and if Ive been there for a while Ill start with at least 30% more because I know that for me, the longer Ive been high the more stubborn it is and the more insulin it will take to correct. Without a CGM I’d be more hesitant to do that…
And, I might offend people by saying so, but an A1C of 8 is… your business! Sure, we could all try harder and do better and all that jazz, but studies show that even with an A1C in the solid 7s, we’re statistically not likely to suffer serious complications. If you’re doing what you can with the tools you have and managing to live a life that’s also otherwise okay, you’re doing great! Don’t apologize to anyone or beat yourself up over not having perfect results!
A few other bits though, because diabetes is complex and theres never just one thing dependent on one other part…
Site rotation is good for so many reasons! You’ve got arms and legs for a reason, so spread the love and jab them also.
Your carb:insulin ratio can change throughout the day, so if you’re using the same ratio for every meal, it would be very reasonable to have to adjust that up or down for different time periods. I think a higher ratio in the morning is more common, but theres sure no hard and fast rule that precludes anyone from needing more insulin for lunch or dinner than for the other meals.
Basal is just an amazing tool! Get a copy of Think Like A Pancreas by Gary Scheiner for a lot of good info on why you should love it but also how to teat your dose(s) and see if you’re on the right track.",Dec '20

Or, perhaps split the Lantus dose into 2 seperate shots with 2 different dosages - like one in the morning and a different one at night. But, since your mornings are OK, then I’m leaning torwards slowly bumping up that Lantus dose from 24 to around 30 - but do this slowly (1 unit per day, maybe) so that if it is gasteoparesis, you don’t overdose. You should see improvement within the week. If not, then maybe is gasteo. The leap to gasteo seems like a large leap in reasoning, though.
Your correction short acting dosages to bring you down from those highs should take 4 hours, NOT 2 hours. Correction is different than meal time insulin. Mine take about 4.5 hours.",Dec '20

3789,Help! spiking 5-6 hrs after eating and resistance!,Type 1 and LADA,CJ114,,"I had similar issues a long time back and the only way to correct for me was to go to 1 meal a day at lunch time.  If I eat dinner, then same will happen to me unless I take fasting acting insulin every 2 hours subsequent to meal to keep blood sugar from rising.  So if I have to have dinner at 6PM due to a family or business gathering, which I pre-bolus fast acting Humalog for about 15 minutes in advance of meal, then I need to take additional insulin at 8PM, 10 PM and if it was more than a light meal, then also at midnight, 2 AM and 4 AM.  I stopped Lantus a few years back because it was causing me daily nightime lows so only use fast acting insulin and I am on MDI (multiple daily injections).

3791,Help! spiking 5-6 hrs after eating and resistance!,Type 1 and LADA,meeeType 1 or LADA,,"My thoughts are it could be any of these- you need more basal, you need to eat less carbs per meal and smaller meals with less fat, you need to eat more, a snack at night with correction as well when needed.  8 is not good, you are getting damage so it could be gastroparesis or other digestive issues too.
Once bg goes over 200 it usually takes a bigger correction and longer to get it down, and your bg will bounce around more for several hours after.
There are a lot of other things that can affect bg, it can spike for hours and crash unexpectedly according to how your body is using the insulin in the mix with hormones, illnesses, sleep, food, activity and so on. And each day can be different.
I recommend a pump for issues like these because it gives you real control of your basal that you will never have with mdi. Some people say they are more stable on the newer long acting insulins so you could try them as well.",Dec '20

Pre-pandemic, I ate at Just Salad 3 times a week, and now working from home, ordered out once a week, but started using Sweet Green, cheaper and more organic, but at one point I started researching the companies via Glassdoor. That changed everything. Just Salad, great. Seamless, great. Sweet Green, sweatshop. I switched back to buying directly from Just Salad, but rely on Seamless for some specialty items we can’t get otherwise, and usually leave a 30% tip.
It’s the least we can do, with so much suffering around, we certainly don’t want to abuse the less fortunate. Granted, we are lucky, my spouse retired with a pension, me working from home, and we don’t want to take advantage of others. Here in Manhattan, everything can be delivered, but relying on the intermediaries, while convenient, takes money away from struggling restaurants, so as often as possible we order directly, as well as tip generously.",Dec '20

It’s usually $5, but it’s been free through the pandemic.  You can also use coupons in the app, so there was nearly always a coupon for free pickup before they started waiving the fee.
There’s always a little card attached to your receipt with your grocery picker’s name that explains they cannot accept tips, but the best way to reward them for good service is to fill out the customer survey and mention your grocery picker by name.  It’s how they receive raises and promotions.
I love the substitution policy, too.  If something you ordered is out of stock, you can allow them to substitute a similar item, and pay the lower cost.  Which usually means I get a larger or more expensive item for the price of the store brand.
Being rural means it’s a 3 hour round-trip trip to the grocery store.  We pretty much only do groceries when there are other chores to be done in town.  After a long day of running around, getting to skip the grocery experience seems like a gift

Then, FreshDirect came to New York. Everything is ordered on line, delivered within a 2 hour window, the prices are often cheaper, since they don’t pay Manhattan rents, and the produce is better, since it isn’t left exposed and wilting for hours, or even days.

Tips are good for teenagers (especially boys) because they get paid on performance. Tips are to ensure promptness and good performance. You shouldn’t tip them if they don’t do a good job. But, they always do a good job for me.
Instacart says that they don’t always pay base salary, though, so you need to know how it works in your local area. Some places they make $10 base hourly salary, plus 5% on the order in default tip. I’ll ask them next time they come. If they work when its busy, then they are making $20/hour…which is good for a teenager.

But, I think feeling bad for people who make tips is often unnecessary & misplaced pity and can undermine quality of service. I do not tip for bad service. I know a lot of bartenders with law degrees who work nights because they  can net 80,000 a year. I was a waitress for years during school and I have never made as much money as that in any professional job....even working at small stripmall restaurants - they need to be good restaurants because people don't tip where the food isn't good.

That’s how they get the best staff and run successful restaurants. Food service is VERY competitive. I have NEVER seen a large company pay someone’s entire tuition. That would be very unusual.

Eventually, like many performers and artists, they had to take their day jobs perm, and I went back to my corporate job. They got married, seem to be living happily.
As for cabbies in NYC, you should read about the taxi medallion scam and the suicides. It is not a joy ride, except for the bankers that scammed the cabbies. Uber and Lyft are no better, and when the economy suffers, the cabbies and the car services suffer even more. You might need to read up on who owns the medallions. They are not most cabbies, and use the medallion to rent out cabs to people making subsistence wages.
The idea that anyone is paying someone’s tuition for restaurant work is ludicrous, unless it was the owner’s children. If it exists, it is exceedingly rare. There are too many overqualified and underemployed people in Manhattan, and too few open restaurants for that to be true, even before the pandemic. As for hiring high quality staff, to paraphrase something I read a few years back, that “great restaurants require great inequality.” I don’y justify it, but poverty makes it easier to hire many people, many overqualified people.
BTW, $15 per hour in MN is great, but in NYC it would translate into a MN equivalent of $6 per hour (using Manhattan) or $10.50 an hour (using Queens):

He pays for all of his waitresses. He doesn’t have to do that. In the cheap hotel that I worked for, my boss paid for my buddy Chewy’s tuition to become a programmer.
What small businesses do is incredible. They make money and they can be great employers.
Things are different now than they used to be, James.
This really surprised me about blue collar work - When I was a janitor, many of us were far more educated than the teachers at the schools. We had to take rigorous exams because boilers are dangerous and operating a building is like operating a ship - think of how much mopping there is (its very physical), you need to make sure people don’t get Legionnaires disease from the air conditioning systems and that the boilers dont explode and kill everyone. I worked almost exclusively with marines and navy guys. Custodians make WAY more than teachers. People don’t realize that. They have old world stereotypes that aren’t valid anymore.
Younger people listen to what older people say because they dont have much else to go on. Boomers gave me a very backwards understanding of how the economy operates, so I want to be careful about that because disabilities can represent profound difficulty and expense for young people who are trying to support themselves. They deserve full information.
It is not the case that blue collar work pays less than white collar work, today. That is a very 1950s perspective.  So, I just want to balance that out. There are programmers who will not hire people with college educations. I’ve been denied a lot of jobs because I was college educated. You need to know when you should not reveal that. There are also people who will not talk to you without a college education, so it goes both ways and its valuable to know who’s doing the hiring.
The restaurant owner who I refer to, majored in math in Ethiopia. So, he is very supportive of young people getting education. But, he’s also very upfront in telling students that we will never make the kind of money that he makes, unless we become surgeons. Its a practical reality. I’ve never worked for a restaurant owner who didn’t own multiple homes. I’m not sure how much restaurant work you have done, but restaurants typically make it and everyone makes a lot of money, or they flop immediately - its high risk, high reward. You get off like a fat rat if you get in somewhere established (meaning that the owner shows up everyday and has been in biz for more than around 3 years…the longer the better).
Teenagers have not been able to get those good jobs since I was a kid. If they can get in the door, now is the time. Those are the types of jobs that put you through college because they are part time and you make a lot of money. Tip jobs are an extraordinary backbone of the economy.

This dude has tended bar (see red arrow in photo) in the neighborhood that got brought down during the protests for a very, very long time. That money supports him so that he can peruse work that is meaningful to him. Everyone in a restaurant or bar has side hustles. They are very entrepreneurial personalities.
All the people I mention here work within a 1 block radius of restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. There are tons of amazing people who wait on you in your crappy hood. I feel terrible about what happened to those places. It wasn’t even just the pandemic thats bringing them down, it was ensuing violence. There’s been a lot of violence in those neighborhoods since the pandemic started. Its forcing the city to shut down the neighborhoods. Those neighborhoods are the lifeblood of our city. Thats were people meet and collaborate and move money around and influence & support one another.
People in those neighborhoods call me personally to show up at their bar if they have a diabetic who is too drunk and they are concerned that he might have low blood sugar. Often, they are college students who just drank too much, but they like to be sure. Those are good, neighborhood establishments.

Although corporations have moved to assessing skills and have broadened their range of acceptable educational backgrounds, the desirable roles often prefer a graduate degree. The exception you mention that rejects education is someone I would unlikely work for, let alone meet, and it doesn’t go both ways, since it is 98-2, pro education vs against, not 50-50, except for jobs that are likely low-paying.


Blue collar work can pay well, but does so less and less often. You can find exceptions for anything, but exceptions don’t disprove the rule, they reinforce it. Telling someone about the 5% that are exceptions still means that 95% is true, and although people can be swayed by the ‘yes, but I know’ type of argument, it is false unless understood as variation. Yes, things have changed, but they’ve gotten even worse for blue collar work, although white collar work is suffering as well, just not nearly as much.


As for janitors being smarter than teachers, I doubt that is true in most cases, or else there is parity/equivalence, but even then, you are overgeneralizing. I live in a large condominium, with at least 50 staff members, and unlike many, they have a union, so afforded protections and benefits. Only a handful are required to pass exams, and only those that get certification can do specialized work, like working on gas lines. The majority do not. Some are likely smarter, but not because of licensing, but because of the inherent inequality of New York. Many are immigrants, and because of how people come to this country, they are often overqualified. Same with cabbies, where they were professionals in their former country, but drive taxis for a living, although many can proudly tell you about the educational and vocational accomplishments of their children in this country.


As for any restauranteur paying for someone’s education, totally ludicrous in NY. You might know someone in Minneapolis, but I doubt it amounts to much, and here it would be near non-existent. Sure, good deeds get done, but the ‘economics’ of the labor market means that that is unheard of.


As for entrepreneurial spirit, not to discount the drive and ambition of the people with side-hustles, it is more often a euphemism for job instability. Yes, when one is young, one might have a side-business. I did, so while in college I made some money setting up computer systems for small businesses, while my real interest was getting a graduate medical degree. When one is older, a side-hustle can be used to transition into a second career or retirement, but again, it often means job instability, cobbling together different gigs to make enough money to live, although it can be more satisfying. Sure, there are exceptions, and there are people who dream of another, more fulfilling career, but…

What sort of an “answer” are you hoping to get? It’s hard to know how much detail to provide you without knowing more about how you intend to use your G6.
Will you be using G6 with an insulin pump (e.g. Tandem)? Will you be using the Dexcom receiver to interact with your G6 sensor? Or will you be using the Dexcom phone app to set up your G6?
Note: If you are going to use your phone, you should verify that the app will work on your phone by checking on the Dexcom compatibly web site 1.
Another Note: Even though you don’t need to, I would recommend entering the G6 sensor code to avoid requiring calibration. You can still calibrate it, but you’ll be able to do it on your own timeline. If you don’t enter the calibration code for a sensor then I believe you’ll be required to calibrate on the sensor’s schedule.
Yet Another Note: For whatever it’s worth, have you tried looking at any of the Dexcom G6 App Training Videos to see if they are any help to you?",8d

Dexcom officially only wants you to calibrate if it’s more than 20% off your fingerstick or 20+ mg/dl off if your fingerstick is less than 80.
Those aren’t my rules, though.  I don’t care much about accuracy with higher numbers, but I want them spot on under 100.  If Dexcom says I’m under 70, but I feel good and the fingerstick says I’m in range… I’m gonna calibrate.  Don’t screw with my data and don’t turn off my insulin!


Make sure you’re using an accurate meter, not a random number generator.


Only calibrate when you’re in range, because that’s when the fingerstick is most accurate.  The margin of errors turn into bigger differences the higher your blood sugar is.


Only calibrate when your trend is flat, and not if you’ve bolused or ate recently and expect the trend line to change.  Glucose concentration changes more rapidly in the blood than the interstitial fluid that Dex measures, leaving a disparity between the two when your BG is changing.


Also make sure you’re drinking your water.  If you’re dehydrated, glucose can’t circulate through the interstitial fluid causing the data to be way off.  Not a good time to calibrate.

Each G6 sensor will have a 4-digit code.  When you insert/start new sensor, you will be prompted for code.  This allows the sensor to not prompt for calibrations, and as some mentioned, results in accurate readings.  But you can still enter calibration if needed, such as when a BG reading is far off and cgm trend is flat.
If you don’t enter the 4-digit code at start, you will be prompted to enter a calibration every 12 hours, which you can do, or ignore it.
If code is not entered, you will likely get less accurate readings at first, since the logic in dexcom uses that code specific to that batch of sensors.

 Robyn_H:

I’m in the US and pay cash for Dexcom G6, and found the subscription to be WAY overpriced.  Of course, they cost a lot more in the US anyway, more than $450 Canadian dollars a month just for the sensors.  I think the subscription was like $350USD/month.   I’m not sure if you have the same shopping opportunities I have, though.
I’ve found the best cash price by buying supplies at Sam’s Club, with the second tier ($100 annually, but we would buy this membership anyway for free shipping of discount bulk goods, so I don’t consider it a pharmacy expense) Plus membership.  The Plus membership comes with BIG pharmacy savings. I pay $284 for 3 sensors and $125 per transmitter (1 every 3 months).
I do restart my sensors.  I can reliably get 25-30 days per sensor.  Technically, my monthly cost should be about $136US.  In reality, though, it’s a little bit less.  I’ve had some early sensor fails that I had Dexcom replace, but still essentially got the few days if did work for free.  I’ve also had two transmitters replacements free of charge for malfunctioning early… equaling about 3 months of transmitter use I didn’t have to pay for.
Do you have Sam’s Club?  If not, do you have similar “memberships only” buying clubs?   You may want to shop around for various pharmacy discount options before you consider the membership.
A lot of the big grocery stores and pharmacies are offering prescription savings clubs now.  You pay a small fee up front to participate, like $50US, and then get a discount on your scripts.  Most have a comparison tool on their website where you can lookup what dex supplies will cost with that particular membership.
Of course, my savings depend highly on the extended restarts.  If you can’t stressfully do several restarts, then the subscription plan starts looking better.


That’s nice to hear. Unfortunately here in Canada, Dexcom is the only source for buying them. No one else like Costco, etc, sells those types of things. You’re lucky you’re able to get so long out of sensors…that definitely saves a lot of money.

At first glance, the subscription is obviously much cheaper, at$299/mo (Canadian).


I’m not aware of this being available in US.
Do you have to commit to a full year subscription, or stop when/if you want.


I’m not sure on that. I think once you commit they have some terms & conditions on cancelling, but I couldn’t find details on cancelling after 30 days…

Really?  That’s terrible.  I had no idea you could only buy direct from Dexcom.  In the US, pharmacy availability is a big selling point for Dex, because it makes it more readily available.  Is that standard practice in Canada to eliminate the middlemen?
Honestly, if I were you in that situation, I would shop around between buying black market, resold sensor/transmitter and compare the costs to buying direct from Dexcom.  I wouldn’t commit to a subscription until you know how long you can get for sensor life.  A lot of people don’t understand the point of restarting sensors because they get timely replacements in the mail at little to no cost to themselves, but when you’re paying out of pocket every day of life you get lowers your final cost significantly.  If you’re not able to get much more than 10 days, then the subscription option will probably be most cost effective.  However, if you can extend your sensors long enough to justify paying for your transmitters (1 every 90-110 days, depending on battery life. You get a free replacement if it dies before 90 days), your best option may just be to buy what you need as you go.
You can’t really know your best option until you get a little experience under your belt with the G6.

 Timothy:

You could only buy from Dexcom.


True for medicare, but recently changed.
Started with Dexcom Seven, then G4, G6.
Most have come via DME, but recently able to get as pharmacy.
For a short time, my employer insurance had a “diabetic kit” mail order deal.  As long as you included insulin, the “kit” could also contain bg strips, syringes, lancets, AND dexcom, for 90 day supply, all for single $40 copay.
I think they initially thought dexcom was similar to bg meter checking, and quickly yanked dexcom, to be billed separately.
For awhile I got mail order pharmacy from Foundation Care, my best experience, but they were bought out and I heard service was very poor after that.
As of this year, I was able to switch to local pharmacy for G6, and use Costco pharmacy, just picked up transmitter today.  DME forced 2 transmitters every 6 months, but I prefer getting transmitter every 3 months for better battery life.",Dec '20
3872,"G6, my phone and Xdrip",Diabetes Technology,SusanS,,"I applied a new sensor this evening. After the 2 hour wait, the Xdrip was blaring that my sugar was 34. (It was actually 116). I did a recalibration and it went sideways. First Xdrip was telling me that I had a calibration error, code 4. I tried to calibrate it again. I was told I had a calibration error, code 4. About 1 minute later, Xdrip screen changed to Signal Missed (top left corner) and a confused calibration code 2 across the bottom.
I tried to fix it, without success. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. I put all the Dexcom info in again. I am still getting the Signal Missed message. I need help. I have an LG V60 thin. I am not tech savvy and have no idea what to do.",Nov '20
3873,"G6, my phone and Xdrip",Diabetes Technology,LaddieType 1 or LADA,4,I have been told by some knowledgeable people online not to calibrate the G6 more than 40 points at a time in order to prevent getting into calibration loops or a situation where the sensor will fail. I would have done several smaller calibrations about 15 minutes apart until my sensor reading was closer to my meter rather than one huge calibration. Unfortunately the situation you ran into is very common for me on the first day of a sensor. After that I find it very accurate.,Nov '20
3874,"G6, my phone and Xdrip",Diabetes Technology,SusanS,,"Thanks for that info. I didn’t know about that calibration issue. I called Dexcom and they are sending out a new sensor. Unfortunately, this is the second sensor in 5 weeks with issues and I am going to run out of sensors before I get home to the new ones.",Nov '20
3875,"G6, my phone and Xdrip",Diabetes Technology,Timothy,2,"I find that if the sensor didn’t go in all the way or is slightly bent I have similar issues as you have.
Sometimes the inserter sticks and will not retract.
When that happens I assume I’ll have a bad sensor.
Usually they fail. But all in all 90 percent of my sensors work right",Nov '20
3876,"G6, my phone and Xdrip",Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,1,"Laddie’s got it right.  You have to calibrate the G6 very gently, or it will just refuse it   I don’t think anyone’s figured out the exact rule though.  I use 40 mg/dl OR 40%, whichever is smaller, as the max amount I can change it at a time.
I’ve never seen a G6 read that low like that, though.  Usually I struggle with high readings, especially after a restart.
Have you been doing this a while, or did you just start on the G6.  I know some people have a really bad first day with it, before it settles into place.  They swear not to calibrate on that first day.  (They’re also the ones that benefit from pre-soaking)  I’m wondering if you’re one of those, or is this one sensor a fluke?",Nov '20
3877,"G6, my phone and Xdrip",Diabetes Technology,SusanS,,"I have been using the G6 since 6/29. I get crazy readings my first 18-24 hours. I can be either very high or very low. It’s not unusual for me to be off by as much as 100 mg/dl. I tried to calibrate because I wanted it to stop blaring at me when I wanted to go to sleep.  IDK what pre-soaking means.
I also have a big problem with the sensor tape staying on. By day 7 all my edges have lifted off. If I use surgical tape or Tegaderm to secure it better, I get rashes. I am still rashed at my last 2 sensor sites. Add to that the 6-8 daily injections, I am running out of places to put things. Lol. It should get better once I start using an insulin pump. That is my January project.",Nov '20
3878,"G6, my phone and Xdrip",Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,2,"I’m not the best person to explain pre-soaking, because I’ve been fortunate to not require it.   But it definitely sounds like you’re a good candidate for it.
You basically insert a new sensor early, and completely ignore it for up to a full day. Don’t stop the existing sensor session, don’t insert the transmitter… just ignore it.  How long you need to “pre-soak” the sensor depends on how long you usually get crazy, erratic readings when you insert a new one.  6 hours, overnight, 12 hours, 24 hours?
There’s some trauma at the insertion site, along with inflammation, and immune response.  That’s the cause of the first day sensor blues.  You’re basically just giving it some time to heal from that trauma before you actually plug in the transmitter and start collecting data from that new sensor.
And trust me, you have my sympathy about the rashes.  I’ve been right there with you for the last six months or so.  Dexcom made a TERRIBLE adhesive change earlier in the year that a LOT of people were allergic to.  They had to change back because of the complaints, and I think I’m finally getting back to non-itchy sensors.  For the first time in forever with my most recent I haven’t been trying to claw a sensor off.
Have you tried the Flonase (yes, the nasal spray) trick? It doesn’t work for everyone, but I’ve had really good luck with it.  You spray it all over the area you’re going to apply the sensor and let it dry, then apply the sensor on top of the Flonase.  If it starts to get itchy again, I get a lot of relief by soaking the sensor tape with it.  I buy the generic equivalent from Sam’s Club, too.  It’s pennies on the dollar, compared to the brand name stuff.",Nov '20
3879,"G6, my phone and Xdrip",Diabetes Technology,TryingType 1 or LADA,1,"@SusanS
Also, you can try waiting 20 minutes AFTER you remove the old senso BEFORE you START the new sensor. A Dexcom rep told me this and it has really increases the accuracy of the new sensor I the first 24 hours. Sometimes I don’t even need to calibrate it at all.
As for keeping the sensor from coming loose, I don’t have a big problem with Dexcom, but I do with my OmniPod pump pods! I started spraying on Skin-Prep on the skin before placing the pod and it has really, really helped. I’ve tried other methods, too, eg., Flonase, but Skin Prep works best for me.",Nov '20

I tried the skin colored pouch they sell. I think it comes in cream or white. While it does clip onto the bra it hangs a little under your bra and is closer to your skin than just wearing the clip with the pump. Also, you can wear it horizontally and vertically.

Go to medtronicdiabetes.com 34 and then store.  I will try to post a pic of it once its up and running again.

As far as breast cancer and wearing the pump in ones bra, I’m sensitive to these kinds of issues since my mother died of breast cancer but I haven’t heard anything other than speculation and “worries” from other people, which aren’t scientific.  Not sure if the pump radiates enough energy to make us ill.  Its not radioactive so at this point I’d rather wear something a little more electronic than not since it keeps me alive and makes my life 100% easier with diabetes. One of the most frustrating issues I""ve had to deal with since being diagnosed is how to wear my pump and conceal it with certain outfits.  What a pain!
I’m pregnant right now and do not even get me started on pregnancy pants and my pump.  I hate pregnancy pants to begin with, but with my pump it brings my irritation level to new heights. Sometimes my pump is too heavy and pulls on my pants.  Grrrr!

3888,The Diabetes Disaster Response Coalition coronavirus response,COVID-19,MilaStaff,2,"WRITTEN BY: Jordan Dakin
On March 12, the Diabetes Disaster Response Coalition (DDRC) 3 circulated an update to coalition members in response to coronavirus (COVID-19). The DDRC works to provide important information and support in natural disasters and events like this and to serve the needs of those with diabetes in times of crisis. COVID-19 has spread throughout much of the world 2 and many questions remain about it will affect people with diabetes specifically in the months to come, but understanding the guidance from local, state, and national health authorities is an important step towards ensuring you and your family are as prepared as possible.
The DDRC has effectively moved into phase two of its plan of action in response to COVID-19. Phase one involved monitoring briefings from federal agencies and working to understand the direct impact on the lives of those with diabetes. As the situation escalated, the DDRC opted on Monday to put forth a plan of response and initiate phase two.
Immediate actions being taken by the DDRC include:

In some states, people with diabetes can receive emergency prescription refills when a state of emergency has been declared. The DDRC is monitoring and supporting medication access and the situation in states that have declared emergency, including where people can receive emergency refills → updates will be posted at diabetesdisasterresponse.org 5

Updating the ADA’s 1-800-DIABETES hotline with up to date information and sharing resources for access in the face of financial hardship like insulinhelp.org

Communicating with other response organizations and monitoring the supply chain for possible gaps in available diabetes supplies (currently, none expected)

“As the entire world faces one of the worst pandemics of recent times, we have to make sure the diabetes community is educated and prepared for any possible issues,” said Mila Ferrer, Program Manager at Beyond Type 1 and liaison to the DDRC. “The DDRC’s mission is to ensure people living with diabetes have the necessary resources and information before, during, and after any disaster. Although COVID-19 is not a natural disaster, it does impact us all directly and we want to be able to provide the vital information our community needs.”
The DDRC will continue to monitor current situations in declared states of emergency and what the availability of emergency prescription refills looks like. They are also working to understand more how insurance coverage works in situations like this.

There have been many tragic stories about people who rationed their insulin. You could minimize the amount of carbs you eat, but you still need basal insulin as well as insulin to cover the rest of your diet.
If you are short of insulin, please consider buying some of the cheaper, no Rx required, old fashioned Regular that is available at Costco, Walmart and other pharmacies. Its action profile is slower than the rapid acting analog insulins you may be used to but you can learn how to use it well.

Insulin is manufactured in a lot of different places all over the world. We are in pretty darn good shaped. Large medical insurers are telling their staff, in town here, that they might expect to need to work from home for 1 - 6 months. The thing about having such a large 3 month supply is that you want to make sure your fridge doesn’t freeze it and that you dont travel without it, or you will end up paying out of pocket. But, I have ordered my full 3 months, as well.
If your ultra worried, you can always go pick up a bottle of R and NPH at Walmart for emergencies. I have syringes that I prob wont use. If the sh!t hits the fan, you can always contact me to send. Its easy to make syringes last a long time. I’ve been using the same 3 ones for, like, 2 years.",Mar '20
3893,The Diabetes Disaster Response Coalition coronavirus response,COVID-19,John_S2,,"While none of us can predict where this will head and/or end up, I would suggest the following:
Look at your current stockpile of supplies and determine how long it will last. If it is a bit thin, try to stockpile some more before anything gets locked down.
Try to identify alternative sources in advance so that you don’t get surprised if your normal/primary source encounters a problem.
If you are traveling, takes extra extras in case you get quarantined, trapped by changes in travel rules, etc.
We all need to be smart and prepared … but I think that advance preparation will go a long way towards allaying your fears.

What version of software/firmware are you using? I believe the latest version is “Moonlight v7.4”. While I don’t know for sure, I got the impression from earlier posts that alarm behavior may have changed as the software has evolved.
FWIW, below is a link to a Tandem vid about finding the software version of your pump. Be aware that vid instructions mostly work, but are out of date. With my v7.4 pump I had to scroll down once in the “Pump Info” section to view the software version.

If it’s the same alarm as the one I’m thinking off, you can actually clear that alarm from happening.  So when it alarms, you clear it, then if you unlock your pump, you are most likely in the bolus wizard screen.  Just exit out of that screen , using the back button at the top, and it shouldn’t alarm again.",9d

I may have remembered it incorrectly but when I was on the Medtronic cgms using the 640 pump, there was no mandatory alarms even for lows.  You can choose to switch it off.

3906,T:slim X2 has different IOB values if CIQ enabled/disabled?,Diabetes Technology,irrational_JohnType 1 or LADA,,"Here is an example of what I’m confused about.
When CIQ is active my Tandem t:slim x2 shows my IOB as (for example):
“Insulin On Board 2.43”
If I turn off CIQ without changing anything else then this changes to:
“Insulin On Board 3.71 4:31 hrs”
The (Insulin) Duration time in my pump’s personal profile is set to 5:00 hours. So it matches the duration value which CIQ ostensibly uses. Because the configuration is the same I expected that the pump would calculate the IOB the same way whether or not CIQ is turned on. 
Does anyone know why on earth turning CIQ on results in a lower IOB value? This makes no sense to me. 
Also, why does the pump display the “time remaining” for IOB when CIQ is turned off but does not show the remaining time when CIQ is turned on? What’s up with that?",6d
3907,T:slim X2 has different IOB values if CIQ enabled/disabled?,Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,,"Tandem made a revolutionary change to the insulin decay model when they introduced Control-IQ.  It more closely resembles how insulin is actually used by the body.
Previously, every Pump to my knowledge used a linear decay model:

You used up insulin at the same consistent rate. We basically set a number for DIA willy nilly based on when we FELT the insulin was no longer effective.  Usually somewhere between 2.5 and 4 hours, after the major insulin peak wore off.  But it wasn’t true… There was always a long-acting tail that wasn’t accounted for and our insulin usage is ANYTHING but consistent.
With control-ig, Tandem changed the decay model to be an exponential decay with a delayed start.  I don’t have a specific picture from Tandem, but the graph is going to look a lot more like a rollercoaster.  Starting out at the baseline, peaking activity 30 minutes after bolus, then slowly tapering off to zero at the five hour mark.  It’s actually approaching zero for a very long time, hence your pump will display 0 IOB long before the 5 hour mark, and really aligns well with anyone previously using a DIA between 2.5-3.5 hours.  It’s also why they locked the DIA in at 5 hours, because they don’t expect us to understand the change they made here.

EDIT:  Came back to say that the very first section of this graph isn’t a true representation, just the closest I could find.  The start of the graph actually should be up high, even with the peak, but it doesn’t really start to significantly decay until after 30 minutes or so.
You can see how the new model better aligns with real insulin usage:

There are other complications with Control-IQ, because it is often adjusting your insulin.  If it delivers a correction bolus or increases your basal, it will add the extra insulin to your IOB.  If it suspends delivery or reduces basal, it will subtract that insulin from the IOB.  The ticking clock telling you when your bolus expires is no longer relevant.  Your IOB is now a living value telling you and the pump exactly how much potential the insulin you have onboard has to lower your blood sugar.
However, the moment you toggle Control-IQ off, it reverts back to the old linear decay model with the ticking clock you define.",6d

My understanding is that Medtronic pumps use a non-linear decay model. Most likely a polynomial 2’nd or at most 3’rd order approximation. I’m surprised that Tandem would still be using a linear model. 



 Robyn_H:

My perspective is that, technically, basal insulin should not be included in the IOB since it is intended to mimic the steady state trickle of a normally functioning pancreas.
However, CIQ probably has to somehow add basal amounts that exceed the basal rate specified in the personal profile as IOB. But I wouldn’t expect it to subtract amounts that weren’t delivered. They simply wouldn’t be added to IOB total. No?",6d

I stand corrected.  I had to research this more.  Apparently the 670G does indeed use what they’re calling a “curvilinear” decay while in auto-mode, so I’m sure the latest pumps do too…  It’s only Omnipod that’s strictly linear now.  It’s all very proprietary, though, because this insulin decay model is what’s setting the new automated systems apart.  I’ve been struggling to piece together my knowledge from various sources and paint an image others can understand.
Outside of pump automation, though, you literally just set a time all your insulin supposedly disappears.  So the point still remains outside the latest models.",6d

Because the article is over 10 years old it refers to pumps that are no longer with us. But the paragraph below seemed to confirm my recollection that Medtronic pumps use a non-linear algorithm.

Medtronic  (and  all  other  pumps  that  we  will discuss)  calculates  IOB  using  an  algorithmic equation so as to match the normal ebb and flow to  insulin’s  activity.    Only  a  small  amount  of insulin  is  used  up  during  the  first  30  minutes,  a great  deal  is  used  up  during  the  next  couple  of hours, and only  a small amount is used towards the end of the insulin’s action curve.

Tandem partnered with Type Zero to fine tune the decay algorithm for Control-IQ, and it is different than previous software models.  Omnipod is working with Tidepool to figure out their take on it, and Medtronic is doing their own thing…  They’re all new, different, and diverging.

I had not yet seen your post when I replied with the reference to Gary Scheiner’s short article.
But I’d also point out that you referenced the 670G and seemed to imply that non-linear was new & unique to the newer pumps and algorithms. That is not how I understand it. Medtronic was apparently using non-linear IOB in it’s Paradigm pumps 10 years ago. This is why I’m really surprised that Tandem would still be using non-linear outside of CIQ.

Previously, before using t.slimx2 with CIQ, IOB was very important to me for calculating corrections to avoid stacking. Since I use Sleep Mode 24/7 and CIQ does not give corrections, I was trying to base my corrections on IOB but found that there was no consistency to the number and, of course, no time indicated.

I’m half-guilty of over-simplifying things, Your knowledge base is more extensive than your question indicated to me.  And also, I learned some new info myself this afternoon.  The article I was reading when I conceded on the “linear” point was comparing the Omnipod, 670g, and X2, hence my specific mention of the 670g…
I honestly did not know pumps were previously using “curvilinear” instead of just linear.  In all my readings and conversation I’ve heard them referenced as simply “linear”.  It’s honestly splitting hairs, though, and I can see why it’s been shortened.
Curvilinear is still a simple equation.  It’s still a defined rate that expires at a specific time.  The Control-IQ algorithm is different.  A 10 unit bolus will last longer than a 0.5 unit bolus, because of the exponential decay.  The closer to the five hour mark you look, the more similar the two boluses will look.  But if you look at other time segments, the difference will become apparent.  The 0.5 unit bolus will quickly devolve into an IOB too small to register, which is displayed as “0”, whereas you’ll still see IOB at the 3 hour mark after the 10 unit bolus… Plus/minus whatever changes CIQ made to your delivery.",6d

It puzzles me that IOB is still there but offers no useful information. At least, no information I find useful for corrections. So, why is IOB there?


Yep.  It is highly variable.  Like I tried to explain earlier, it’s a living value now.  Constantly changing.  The clock doesn’t matter.
It is indeed still useful information, though.  If anything, it should be easier for us.
Let me ask, why does the time the insulin was delivered matter to you?  I unit is 1 unit, and carries the potential of your correction factor, so why does the clock matter?  Do you place different value on the IOB if it was delivered at different times?  Have you from previous years of experience learned that the IOB display is more accurate at some times than others?  I’m assuming the answer is something along the lines of “the previous decay models were inaccurate, but I’ve learned to accommodate for them.”
Control-IQ has made advances to correct that notion.  It is all about insulin potential now.  If your correction factor is 1:50, and the IOB says 1.5… you currently have enough insulin POTENTIAL on board to bring you from 175 to 100 mg/dl.  You don’t have to stop and fret about exactly when that insulin was delivered, so you can determine it’s value.  Most of that IOB was probably from your bolus, but some of that insulin was delivered repeatedly every 6 minutes as basal adjustments.  There’s no one single clock counting down.  A new clock starts every six minutes, and they all run simultaneously.
The IOB indicated the value of insulin in your system that is in excess of your basal, not just simply your last bolus.  IOB is reduced if basal is withheld, because that  suspension reduced the BG-lowering potential of all the insulin in play at that given moment.  Likewise, IOB increases if extra basal is given, because you now how increased potential to lower BG.  We’re blurring the lines between defined basal and bolus roles.",6d
3917,T:slim X2 has different IOB values if CIQ enabled/disabled?,Diabetes Technology,Willow4,,"@Robyn_H, it is not the time of IOB that matters to me but the amount. And the amount seems to vary constantly. Yes, the amount may be enough to bring me into range at one point but several minutes later it may not be right and may in one instance bring me low, in another, leave me higher than I would want to be. I suppose the thing to do is not to correct myself. However, the range I strive for is not the range that CIQ is set for.
I am in the process of following your suggestion to adjust the basals as soon as my new CGM transmitter arrives. Had a bad one and no backup and have had a dumb pump throughout the holidays.

3918,T:slim X2 has different IOB values if CIQ enabled/disabled?,Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,,"I was editing my above post as you were writing this last response.  Maybe go back to read the last paragraph or two i changed about insulin potential?
I also suspect you’ll gain more confidence in trusting the IOB once your settings are situated correctly.  I think your correction factor probably still needs tweaking if you’re getting erratic results.
You might also just be overthinking it.  I think we sometimes run into a problem with being TOO informed and trying to out-think the technology.  Remember, this stuff is written to bring good control to the average user, not as carrot dangling for the privileged.  They’re putting in more effort on the design end to require less thinking on the user end.  Could you try just giving the IOB a little blind faith for a bit? Maybe only give corrections with the bolus wizard, and let it do the thinking?
Also, I’m under no disillusion that Control-IQ is perfect.  There are significant changes coming in the near future, and maybe you’ll be more satisfied then.  I don’t think you’ll ever see the return of the countdown timer, though.  I don’t think it’s feasible when the system is always changing your IOB.

You can easily do this experiment and then watch your BG numbers. I try to eat my final meal of the day at 3:00 p.m. and avoid snacks in the evening. I eat some vegetables most days but think they are not as nutritionally important as some people think. Let your meter be your guide.
If you eat primarily protein and fat for your last meal of the day, you can adjust your insulin dose based on that nutrition profile, so that you minimize the delayed BG rises if you only dose based on carbs.

This is my favorite line of thought when it comes to food.  People are always looking for a shortcut to fastest results, which seems to contain inevitable short-comings… And in some cases, dangers.  Any sort of extreme diet scares me.  Unfortunately, finding balance is difficult in a world where carbohydrates are delicious, cheap, readily available, and shelf-stable and the media is always trying to sell us on a new extreme.
@jenni_bean  I haven’t seen any mention of type or treatment.   I’ve gotten the impression that you’re a type 2, just because of no mention of meal-time boluses.  True?  I’m wondering if you’re trying to control by diet and exercise alone, or if you’re taking any medication.
Besides some nighttime indulgences, it doesn’t seem like you’re eating a bad balance at all.  It doesn’t seem like you should have to go to the extreme of cutting out everything but meat and fat from your evening meal.  It’s like you skipped the idea of limiting your carb indulgence and jumped right to the far extreme on the diet scale.
It strikes me as if you need to talk to your doctor about adding to or adjusting your medication if you’re to the point you feel like you can’t eat a reasonable, balanced meal anymore.
I’ve gotten the impression that many Type 2s are reluctant to add medication to their diet/exercise regime.  Like they feel they somehow failed at being diabetic if they need more help.  Short of STIs, I don’t know if any other illness that comes with so much stigma.  There are so many treatment options to try, and no shame in any of them.

Oh, please don’t do that. None of us is perfect. The late night snacking could mean you are lacking some nutrient and your body is urging you to ingest it. But nutrition is difficult. We don’t always know what our body needs.
Someone also mentioned try doing something at night that gets your mind off of food. Not easy if that is what the body wants! I don’t have any good suggestions but you’ve come up with some good ones. Besides working out like rower or walking, reading a good book, or other fun mental tasks, may work to preoccupy your mind.
I know for me personally every season causes a transition. Winter causes my body to crave food and I inevitably gain a few pounds before I transition to the new season. Maybe that is happening to you, too? Maybe your body actually needs the extra fat for winter. I feel that is the case for me.

On one had, you need to be honest to yourself about what you are eating. Bite the bullet, tell yourself that you are going to eat the whole thing, and then control for it, with proper insulin amounts. Not ideal, but at least your blood sugar will be okay, and that’s particularly important to avoid complications from the virus.
On the other hand, you want to get your eating under control, ideally without exercising will power. Pardon if I tell you things you likely already know or already do. Don’t buy your problematic foods in the first place, so, when you purchase food, do so on a full stomach. Stick to a list of good foods. Don’t buy ‘bad’ snacks. If you do buy ‘bad’ snacks, don’t leave them on the counter. Try to buy healthy snacks in prepackaged amounts, so beside fruit or veg, have SMALL packets of nuts, dried fruit, or figs. Don’t buy the bulk bag. Also, as discussed, find something that your enjoy to fill you time.
As to the last point, I often choose activities that are a little obsessive for me. If it keeps me engaged too much, that is what I want. I had mental health issues when I was younger, and I found that intense focus solves a problem that I had, so when I find something that makes me forget to eat, I keep it. When I was younger, simply talking to a woman could do that.

People on social media might not understand this, but ACE2 expression does not decrease the minute you stop taking ACE inhibitors, but that might take quite some time. Stopping with ACE inhibitors therefore does not immediately decrease the risk of Covid-19 infection, while the blood pressure could rise much faster. That would make everything worse.
This hypothesis and the ESC Council statement don’t necessarily contradict each other. Two claims can be true at once: 1) ACE inhibitors increase the susceptibility to Covid-19 infection 2) ACE inhibitors might protect against serious lung complications.
Finally they suggest that calcium channel blockers might be a good alternative that doesn’t increase ACE2 expression.

As to actual infection rates - no country in the world has very good statistics about the actual number of folks infected. They are only reporting confirmed cases.

Right. If I were on an ACEI or ARB, I would probably not stop it. I think it’s best to check with the doc. From what I’ve read of different studies, ACE inhibitors and ARBs result in upregulation of ACE2. I suppose this is a natural consequence of something flooding to block the receptors. On the other hand, the receptors are blocked! So, wouldn’t that be a good (ie preventative) thing? Hence the European study (I guess). Honestly, I don’t know.
I’ve also read that ACE2 can also be increased by ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones a class of diabetic medicines. Just passin along what I’ve read.

3980,First trimester BG control on MDI - 10 wk update,Diabetes and Pregnancy,daisy707,7,"Hi all!
I wanted to do a little update on here about how my pregnancy and blood sugar is going. I know before getting pregnant I had posted several threads and read a ton because I was so nervous about going through pregnancy with t1d. This might be long winded but I don’t want to forget any details. Just for reference, I am on MDI (Tresiba and Novolog pens) and use a glucose meter.
So far, things have been pretty much normal! Baby had a strong heartbeat at my 8 week ultrasound! So very thankful and relieved for that appointment and ready to go back again! I haven’t had any issues with blood sugar control, aside from needing a bit more insulin. I’ve been very lucky in only battling mild to moderate nausea but haven’t actually gotten sick. Food aversions and nausea were most prevalent weeks 6-8 but now it has eased up. I haven’t had many lows at all; I’m really not sure what weeks most t1d’s experience lows, I’ve read different things. For me though, things have been pretty steady and normal.
I want to also throw out there for anyone thinking about getting pregnant but don’t have a GCM or pump; it is possible to have good, tight control without them. I know I’m not in the later months of pregnancy yet, but I check my sugar (I always have) 8-10 times a day, if not more if I’m more active. I correct if I need to, but I’ve been able to be under 85 fasting, and under 140 two hours after meals (my OB guidelines), and my A1C is 5.3. I was most nervous going into this because so many people told me I can’t do it without those tools, but it is possible. It hasn’t been hard on me, because I’m so used to testing often and correcting anyway; I really think a lot of it has to do with how you know your body and knowing how to control to begin with. I don’t have the option to get those tools because of insurance reasons, so if anyone is in the same boat I want you to know you can do it too!
I go for another ultrasound and bloodwork in two weeks and then we’ll be announcing to everyone! I’m so excited and since we’re getting genetic testing done as well, I was given the option to know the gender early also, which we’re excited about. Genetic testing was for sure happening anyway, so why not know early if I can! I can’t wait. As far as specialists or endos; my OB’s office is fine with me just seeing my primary doc who writes my insulin scripts and such. I actually don’t have a doctor who “monitors” for me. I don’t feel comfortable with anyone telling me what to do with my diabetes, but she is one who I feel comfortable with if I do need help. I make all adjustments myself and she is confident in my self care which is what I needed through this. I know some need more assistance or guidance which is totally fine, but with not having many options near me, I am very thankful that the office is letting me see her instead of their team of endos. I saw an endo in their group prior to becoming pregnant and it was an awful experience (see my endo venting thread). So having my team set up and knowing that I can breeze through this pregnancy without having tons of different docs critiqing my BG managment, really eases my stress. The more I stress about my numbers the more awful they are, but when I can relax and correct as needed, etc. I do just fine.
I was so worried about sever morning sickness, bad lows and just having an awful time. The main thing I’ve battled is fatigue so I’ve been sleeping a ton. I’m so beyond grateful for not having morning sickness like a lot of women do, because I was very scared about extreme BG lows. I’m still keeping an eye out though because one thing I’ve noticed since becoming pregnant is my low symptoms changing. Instead of getting the shakes and things, I’ll just get super nauseous if I drop. That was hard to decifer when I was in my most nauseous weeks, but it seems like my body is leveling out and my low symptoms are starting to get back to normal.
That’s all I have for now and I hope that gives some encouragement to anyone TTC or wanting to, and who are scared. I never, ever thought I would have a baby. For me, so much research and planning about T1D went into this before trying because of my fears but I want you to know that reading and researching is your friend, reaching out via this forum is a great thing to do, and having faith in yourself to have good control is what you need!

My endo would NOT allow me to stay on Tresiba while pregnant because “it hasn’t been tested on pregnant women” and was still fairly new so I had to switch to that old 12-hour one and take 2 shots a day (can’t remember the name off hand…prepare yourself now for “mom brain” like that…  )
And I was basically forced into seeing a MFM because I was “high risk.” Which ended up a good thing, as you read my post the other day. But not sure why I needed to see them the entire time, instead of just 3rd trimester on.
As soon as my first trimester lows started hitting me, I told my husband that I don’t know why they don’t allow pregnant type 1’s to use a Dexcom for 9 months for free. I definitely couldn’t have done it without one, but my control is much more up in the air than yours seems to be. Kudos!

As for my control; I am honestly so surprised it’s not more all over the place. When I went off the pill and had my menstrual cycle, and even while on the pill at times, it was a crap shoot. It would be high then constant lows, and all over the place for a week and a half. Maybe it’s because I’m more on top of testing now or something, but I’m just thanking God it’s been easy so far! I know it will get more resistant later on, but one day at a time.

3987,Knowledge is power: screening for T1D,Type 1 and LADA,MilaStaff,2,"WRITTEN BY: MAKAILA HEIFNER
Individuals can now get screened for T1D from home. JDRF just announced the T1Detect program – raising awareness and education of a new at-home screening test for T1D antibodies. Everyone, regardless of relation to someone with confirmed T1D, is eligible. If you or someone you love is interested in T1D screening, click here. 1
A CRASH COURSE IN T1D
Jerry Brzozowski was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes two weeks before he graduated high school in 1996. He was working as a veterinarian when he met his wife, Samantha. Jerry was always vocal about his T1D, but he continued to live his life as normally as he could, so much so to the point that Samantha wasn’t entirely sure how T1D worked. That was until their first daughter, Vivian, was diagnosed at the age of 2.
Samantha explains, “As cool as a cucumber you want to be about going about your day-to-day life, there are a lot of obstacles you secretly overcome. Our daughter being diagnosed was absolutely when I fully learned that this can be a very challenging disease at times. At the same time, I’m grateful for [Jerry’s] outlook, because it was definitely calming for me. When I meet other parents who have newly diagnosed kids, there’s sometimes a sense of fear and panic — I didn’t really have that because Jerry was my good example.”
When Jerry was diagnosed, there wasn’t much research that had been done on the genetics of Type 1 and doctors believed his diagnosis was something of a fluke, due to the fact that no one else in his family had T1D. For these reasons, Jerry and Samantha were not on the lookout for signs of T1D but they explain that, now, looking back they can see Vivian had all the symptoms.
“If we look at pictures, she had that classic kind of malnourished type look,” Samantha remembers. “But I was a skinny kid, Jerry was a skinny kid. We really didn’t think much beyond that, but she started guzzling water and soaking through her nighttime diapers a lot. He came home from work on a Saturday afternoon and I told him, “I think you need to check her blood sugars.” And, he knew. We never had to say anything to each other after that. We both knew what it was, and we got in the car and drove to the hospital.”
SCREENING FOR FUTURE T1D DIAGNOSES
Fortunately, the family caught Vivian’s diagnosis early enough and she was not in DKA. At the hospital, the Brzozowskis were introduced to TrialNet, a genetic testing service that works to identify T1D at its earliest stages and find ways to delay or prevent the disease in individuals at risk. The family learned that it was actually possible to screen for Type 1 diabetes prior to onset. That a simple blood test could tell the likelihood of developing T1D by looking at certain antibodies.
At the time of Vivian’s diagnosis, her younger sister, Evelyn, was only six months old. The family had to wait another six months, but after Evelyn’s first birthday they went back to the hospital and had her samples drawn.
“It was a no-brainer for us. Both of us coming from more of a scientific background and working with animals, to us, knowledge is power, even when it comes to knowing medical conditions and pending medical conditions. The more proactive that you can be the better. To me, it armed us to be able to research deeper,” Samantha says.
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER
After her samples were taken, she tested positive for three out of the four antibodies that indicate whether someone is at risk for T1D. The family was told that the likelihood of Evelyn developing Type 1 by the age of five was nearly 100%. She has since surpassed that milestone, and still shows no signs of Type 1 but continues to be monitored and receive A1C checks with her sister.
The Brzozowskis remain diligent and aware of Evelyn’s chance of developing Type 1, but they see this knowledge as powerful, rather than detrimental.
“Knowledge is power,” Jerry reminds us. “The biggest thing is having it on your radar so if those symptoms start popping up, you’ll be ready. It’s just a matter of being more aware and to hopefully prevent hospitalization just by routine checking.”
EPILOGUE
This interview took place on September 28, 2020. Since that time, Evelyn has officially been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and has started on insulin. Samantha told Beyond Type 1 “We are even more thankful for the testing, because we were able to catch her SO early on and avoid any trauma from a hospital stay.”",Dec '20
3988,Wait before you upgrade app to dexcom 1.8,Diabetes Technology,TedK,1,"Hi All,
I’ve been a Dexcom user for 8+ years and earlier this year started using the G6 with my phone.  It started out as a great system where I could get my readings on my phone vs carying an extra device, and plus no calibrations are great as well.
Now for the warning…my app has been bugging me for a couple of weeks to upgrade and I’ve been putting it off.  I was about to do it tonight but glad I hesitated after reading feedback on Google play…it appears that the new version 1.8 will not allow the app to work unless you allow it to lambast you with notifications!  In other words,  gone is the ability to manage your readings without annoying vibrations and beeping.  With my current app, I could disable notifications so not to be bothered while in critical meetings or formal events.  From my understanding, the new version does not allow users to stop notifications else you won’t get your glucose reading!  There are times when I run low but know my level will rise after I just ate a few glucose tablets but I’ll have no choice but to listen to the dexcom beeps until my numbers rise.  Sorry but I am thoroughly disgusted with this change.  ONCE YOU UPDATE YOU CAN’T GO BACK TO THE OLD VERSION.
Others are annoyed that it constantly requires users to allow location information…not just when checking your level.  Any other app makes this an option, not a requirement.
Hope this helps others avoid this repulsive requirement.

Thanks for your reply.  I’m using an S9 so assume I’d have a similar experience to yours.
For reference, here is what I see on my screen today.  Based on the paragraph at the bottom appears to indicate that even if you put your phone in DND (do not disturb mode) it will still sound the irritating alarms.
Additionally, here are a few reviews I saw on Google Play:
""on a samsung note 9, the current update overrides the dark mode preference on the quick glance feature. this wasn’t an issue on the previous version. it also overrides the disabling of the “BEEP BEEP BEEP” urgent low sound. again, this was not the case with the previous version and is insanely annoying. please, please, please patch this as it wakes me up at night. i’ll update my review to 5 accordingly, please for the love of god just change it to the way it was. please and thank you""*
“Works good, but beware of permissions on the phone. Up until recently I could set my phone to Do Not Disturb when i went to bed. I am lucky enough to wake up if my bloodsugar is out of whack, however, after the app has updated I can no longer use the DND in order to keep the app quiet. I cant tell the app that it’s not exempt from DND, because then it wont show me any glucose levels, so now I need to turn off my phone at night, but my phone is my alarm clock… not ok…”
Reviews were posted 12/18/20 and 12/19/20 respectively.
I’m curious if you have a different take on this?  Please advise.
Thanks,

Your other option is to go to Settings - Apps --Dexcom G6 and force stop the app.  That will stop everything.  I’ve done that for prolonged lows that I was treating and didn’t want to hear the alarm.  Better than turning off your phone.",10d
3992,Wait before you upgrade app to dexcom 1.8,Diabetes Technology,TedK,1,"Sounds good.  I’ll do the forced stop if I need a situation where I require no alarms.
Compared to before, it was much easier to treat with appropriate amount of food, then go back to bed vs listening to beeps until I got back to normal range.  Now I’ll be forced to shut down the app and also lose the ability to know where my levels are until I re-start app.
The ability to avoid the upgrade now seems to be a moot point as it appears Dexcom is forcing everyone to upgrade by 1/6 based on my screen shot.  I’m hoping there is enough dis-satisfaction expressed with the new requirements, that they revert back to the previous settings.
I’m a stock holder in DEX (albeit not a large amount) but know there is competition on the horizon from Abbot’s freestyle Libre 2.  It provides reading every minute vs every 5 but every 5 is just fine by me.    The greater difference is an 4 extra days (14 total) with the Libre.   If their app is less annoying, it would make it worthwhile for me to change over, once available in the US.  The G6 is very easy to install a sensor and virtually pain free for me, so Libre would need to be similar to convert.
Regarding the blue tooth constant location tracking requirement, there is no need for this unless Dexcom is selling your location tracking information to other organizations in an effort to make money.  Perhaps as a supplement to lost dollars from competition?

I stared at that DND issue for a while before I upgraded. I concluded that they are really just enforcing what the previous intended operation was. (And possibly FDA required though I don’t know.) With no concerts at present, I haven’t had a chance to verify it, though I plan to try soon. I set my low alert at 90 anyway, so I’m comfortable with the idea of the urgent low blasting through.
So far what bothers me most about the new version is that when there’s an alert and I switch to the app, it flashes the screen a couple of times before activating. Hard to describe. If I hit the OK on the alert quickly, it doesn’t take because even though the alert shows, the app isn’t ready to process the tap.

Narrow Angle Glaucoma
I am now set  up to have Laser Peripheral Iridotomy. surgery for Narrow Angle Glaucoma.  My eye test from last year was fine and I had my normal eye exam in August and she said I needed to see the specialist and she would not be dilating my eyes.
I just saw the specialist and I have 80% closure in both eyes, so the surgery is set up for January. Only one eye was showing to be a significant problem back in August. Normal pressure levels in my eyes for now. It is surprising how fast it happened, but he said it is an inherited disease and people that are farsighted are at higher risk and more prone to it as you get older. He described it as a clogged sink that is still slowly draining.
If your eyes are dilated with this condition you can set off an acute closure attack, as when the eyes are dilated they expand and can close off all drainage. It is inherited but this type of glaucoma is not directly connected with diabetes. This surgery usually permanently solves the problem, sometimes in a few over time it slowly comes back, but he said by the time if it did, because of my age, I would probably be having cataract surgery which also solves the issue as it allows drainage because of the lens being removed.
But he said it is an inherited genetic disease and likely someone else in the family has had this condition or will have it. I get yearly complete exams because of my diabetes, this disease can have a fast onset. Kind of scary if you’re not getting regular check ups.
Supposedly a very easy surgery, I could walk out and drive home. No pain. But steroid eye drops for 4 days after, which, oh goody, they affected my dog’s blood sugar and I am really sensitive to steroids, but they are needed to keep down swelling after.

Laser Peripheral Iridotomy: Surgery for Narrow-Angle Glaucoma






Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI)
For Narrow Angle Glaucoma
The treatment of narrow angles and narrow-angle glaucoma.
Narrow-angle glaucoma (also known as angle-closure glaucoma) occurs when the angle between the iris and the cornea in the eye is too small. This causes the iris to block fluid drainage, increasing inner eye pressure. LPI makes a small hole in the iris, allowing it to fall back from the fluid channel and helping the fluid drain.",Dec '20

I don’t remember the steroid drops affecting my blood sugar at all. But, then again, I’ve had steroid injections that also didn’t affect my blood sugar. So maybe I am just weirdly immune to the effects of steroids on blood sugar. I definitely did need the drops, though (I took them for a week each eye). My eye was starting to swell shut by the time I picked up the prescription, and I had some irritation during the first 24 hours. I got public transit home, no problem.

Not really as I’m not doing anything particularly inventive.
It’s almost always just about 500g of white flour with some (~110g) oatmeal plus the other usual suspects. Yes, I’m in a rut but it’s a familiar one. 
As for gluten I add around 30 to 40 grams. I like my dough “sticky”. (Of course, I use a bread machine which means I don’t have to knead the sticky stuff.  )
I do try to track the carbs of the ingredients so I have a number for the total carbs supposedly in the loaf. Then when I eat it I weigh the slices so I can come up with a carb count for the “slice”.

I’m not quite clear if the “dry milk” you used was buttermilk powder or just, well, dry milk. 
For reasons I can’t empathize with, buttermilk is hard to find in my area of upstate NY. Usually all you can find these days is the small pint sized (?) cartons. A few years back you could still get it by the 1/2 gallon at one of the local grocery stores, but that went away.
