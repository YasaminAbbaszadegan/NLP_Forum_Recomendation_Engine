My wife and I are now both retired and have settled into a routine that we both are comfortable with. After breakfast we will both catch up on e-mail and messages, read the local newspaper, a magazine or a book, until lunchtime. After lunch, weather permitting, we’ll go for a hour’s walk along the waterfront. The rest of the afternoon until dinnertime we’ll devote to our hobbies: for my wife it is oil painting for me it is repairing or upgrading the computers and electronic gadgets of friends and neighbours.
After dinner, once again weather permitting we will go for a half hour walk. (These walks are great for my diabetes type 2 and have kept me off insulin for the past 20 years).
Finally back home again it is movie time. I’ve invested in an Epson projector ($600) that gives me a 12 foot wide screen on a living room wall, a used desktop computer ($60) that connects me to various streaming video sites including Amazon Prime and Netflix, and a popcorn machine ($80).

13,Unfriendly cats,Social Clubs,Social Clubs,Vancouversailor,1,"I have two cats, one a female rescue cat who is about 12 years old and the other a male who I got as a kitten from a farm about a year ago. The main reason I got the second (male) cat was because the female (Pumpkin) was getting pretty sedentary, and I thought that a young male (Fella) would be a good companion and maybe encourage her to be more active. Well it’s been a year and Pumpkin is still terrified of Fella and lies under the bed hissing and growling when he comes visiting. And I think Fella thinks that is fun. So we  have to let the cats take turns having the run of my apartment, while the other one is locked up in the spare bedroom.  It seems that the main problem is that Pumpkin by nature is very timid - my daughter rescued her out of a garbage bin in Austin, Texas where my daughter lived at the time and where the kitten’s owner had dumped her. It is a bit of a drag having to keep one  of the cats locked up for half the day and then it is the others turn, but I am at a loss on how to get them to be friends. Any suggestions?",Sep '18

I’d like to introduce you to my 2 furry children.
Hey Buddy is our Westie (West Highland Scottish Terrier), whose middle name is I’m Busy.  He’s a total gentlemen, a great empath and I’m sure he is a very old soul.  He feels deeply, loves going wherever I’m going, loves to stand by my husband’s side during gardening chores.  He greets everyone with unbridled enthusiasm and love.  And he will instantly bring a toy to any guest who comes to the house.
Bon Bon is our Lhasa Apso … a VERY sweet child who, I’m sure, is NOT an old soul.  She responded to COME only when she thinks about it first.  Lhasas were raised as Tibetan palace guards and she is happiest when in the middle of the bed, looking out to the garden.  She LOVES tummy rubs and larger dogs!

Spend time running to build your endurance. Vary your pace and distance to build the 3 main physiologies in running - your endurance, your max oxygen consumption, and your lactate threshold.
Vary what you are doing so you don’t get bored. So maybe some short fast runs on some days, and some longer slower runs on other days. Just do whatever you are able to do.
When you are starting out, the most important thing is not distance, but just time spent running. All the metrics of speed and distance come later.

From IMBD:
On the rocky path to sobriety after a life-changing accident, John Callahan discovers the healing power of art, willing his injured hands into drawing hilarious, often controversial cartoons, which bring him a new lease on life.
Commentary-
This is based on real events and is a wonderful movie.  Joaquin Phoenix  is known for thrown himself into roles and this is an example of just that.  He shows his versatility by portraying a man who through some fault of his own and some not, finds himself in a wheel chair.  He fights this outcome and in the process finds himself.  It is sometimes difficult to watch, but I could not turn away.
Jonah Hill, Rooney Mara, and Jack Black turn in wodnerufl supporting actor roles.  This movie is not kid friendly, and maybe not a date night movie.  Sheryl and I loved it but it may be great an established couple.
Rated R
Some cool facts
Robin Williams was originally cast in the lead

Third, I got an ERR=404 (page not found) error a couple times – had to try multiple times before I could get through, including resending the password confirmation email.  Finally, once I reviewed the Profile and clicked on the ‘Home’ button, I got an ERR=503 error page - went “back” and tried again and it worked – that happened at least twice to me.

Hello Brian,
is the absence of a visual hierarchical structure in the replies really indended? In the old discussions imported from the old site even the @user information is missing. The whole progression of the discussion is therefore gone. Even if the @user information is present - as in the new discussions - the structure of who is replying to whom and why is hard to grasp now. In my experience with the Discourse system there was always a visual identation for replies. Perhaps this is a configuration issue?


@Holger_Schmeken, your observation is absolutely true.  I don’t know if you remember back in the days of “newsgroups” but at that time discussion threads were hierarchical.  These days discussions threads have moved to a linear approach.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each.  The old ning platform supported hierarchical threads.  Discourse supports linear threads.  It has three mechanisms to achieve the same sort of thing hierarchical threads provide


You can “quote” using either the little quote button on the tabs or by selecting text in the discussion thread, highlighting it and selected “quote reply.”  This lets you comment specifically on something someone else said.


You can use “@member” to comment to a specific member


You can reply as a “linked topic” which let’s you do essentially what the hierarchy does by creating a new thread that is linked without fragmenting the original thread.


I understand your concerns about how well the content migrated over, I know this was a topic of discussion by the team and I suspect it caused much study and concern.  You are right, it may lead to some confusion and very long and fragmented threads may well not be understandable.  But I also think large threads (like the big Afrezza thread) became so fragmented on ning that you could not follow the discussion.  In the end, if you look at the vast majority of current discussion platforms they have all moved to this approach.  I do appreciate the feedback but I don’t think there is much that can be done to change things, there is just some fundamental mistmatch.

83,How to Customize Your Profile,TuDiabetes Website,TuDiabetes Website,Brian_BSC,1,"These are instructions on how to tailor your profile on TuDiabetes.  This tailoring is intended to go with the instructions on How to Use a Profile 3 and How to Create a Detailed Profile 2.
The first step is to visit your own profile by left clicking on your own avatar in the upper right corner.  Then select to visit your own profile by hovering over and left clicking the icon .  Then select “Preferences” in the upper right .  This will bring up the first page which allows you to tailor your profile.  You can select your “Type,” load a profile picture and then set the background that will appear on your popup card and on your profile page.
Once you have completed that, then scroll down the page to see the link “Edit Personal Information 1.”  Left click that link and you will be brought to a page with further detailed profile information.  Not all of it will be visible to others.  I will only discuss the fields that are visible to others, the rest is only visible to DHF and the admin team.  Here are descriptions of each field:
Display Name - This is the name that appears as a second name on your card and in your profile page.  It is not your username which must be unique.  You also user the username when you “@” someone (not their Display Name).  Use the Display Name if you want people to know another nickname for you or if you wish to be known by another name.  I always advise everyone to protect their real name from being revealed, but should you wish to do so you can use your real name for your Display Name.
Country: This will appear on your profile page.
Website:  This can be any website that you wish to appear on your card and in your profile page.  I put my personal blog into that field.  You can put your Detailed Profile 2 in that field if you wish.
About Me: This final field is a series of text that will appear in your card and in your profile page.  Only the first line or two will appear in your card.  However the entirety of whatever you write in this field will appear on your profile page.  Should you choose to not have a Detailed Profile you could use this field for a more detailed story.  If you have anything significant in this field your profile will first appear without showing the “About Me” text and there will be an “Expand” button on the upper right which will reveal the full content.  The only tricky thing I also did was to insert a hyperlink “Profile for Brian (BSC)” in my profile to link to my Detailed Profile.  To insert a hyperlink just write in the text of the link “Profile for Brian (BSC)” and it will automagically appear as a link
Below is my “card” and profile page with the fields above indicated on where they appear.

So here are three situations with their current process to reset passwords
If you have not obtained access and were an existing member of TuD before the migration then perform the following steps:

Go to TuDiabetes.org

Select “Lost your password?”
Enter your email of record and select “Get New Password”
Read email from and click the enclosed link
Enter desired password in both fields and select “Reset Password”
Log in to TuDiabetes with the reset password using your email of record

If you have already logged in to TuDiabetes and wish to reset your password do the following

Go to the “home” and select the link “Need to change your password?”

104,Old timers of the original Tudiabetes,TuDiabetes Website,TuDiabetes Website,Terry4,9,"I wasn’t one of the original TuD community members as I joined in 2009. I was lurking, however, at least a year or two before that. I read with keen interest the “carb war” discussions. Those discussions provided me with the insight and ability to adopt carb limits in response to an adverse diabetes complication in 2012.
I live with T1D and even though our numbers are increasing, the chance of someone with T1D interacting with someone else in a sustained community-like way in real life is fairly rare. For me, TuDiabetes changed that.
I’m not much of a joiner in my life but this virtual community has materially changed my diabetes life towards a much better trajectory. In addition to launching me into the sustained (8 years now) habit of using food to positively affect my health, it also introduced me through a mentor I met here to the world of do-it-yourself open source diabetes tech that significantly improved not only my physical health but my emotional well-being.
I am probably one of the more continuously active members over many years still active today. I don’t feel nostalgia for the old days and I’ve watched many active members come and go. While I “met” @acidrock23 here, I’ve also met him in real life for coffee and at a few diabetes conferences. He’s still active on some of the Facebook diabetes groups.
People come and go in any community, whether it be one in real life or the virtual variety. We all live with changing needs. I have felt estranged from this community from time to time (just recently, as a matter of fact) but have always drifted back as I do find meaning in helping individual community members. I feel like my ability to write is the gift life has given me and It’s my job to put it to some good use. This community also continues to teach me something new at times.
I do think that TuD members tend to explore issues at a greater depth than other online communities. Facebook, in particular, reminds me of the pick-up bars of my young adulthood where short and snappy remarks were prized and anything deeper than witty quips was not rewarded.

Sad that the story doesn’t tell the story of how millions of pump user’s A1Cs have dropped dramatically when switching to a pump leading them to a better - longer life.  While they are not for everyone, they can make life so much more “normal” for so many.
As for me, I have used Disatronic/Animas/Tandem/2nd Tandem over the last 18 years.  There have been times that I questioned if a pump was working properly.  Almost every time, either a site change,  or better understanding of the carbs and fat in my diet fixed the problem (User error)  My only hospitalization due to diabetes since I was diagnosed almost 40 years ago was 3 months before going on my first pump - Thus the reason for switching.
There have been high sugars, and lows.  There have been times I have given myself an extra dose via syringe because i was concerned about a pump not working properly, Again - likely a bad site.
Best suggestion - Understand that pump is a medical device you we wear everyday and every night.  There are very few things, if any, that can stand up to that type of abuse.  Recognize their potential limitations and keep as close an eye on your blood sugar as a CGM or testing will allow.  it is the diabetic’s (Or parent of a young diabetic) disease to manage.  As a diabetic, I am grateful that the disease is for the most part pretty manageable, a lot more so than so many other diseases, but it does require management.  And yes i do realize that malfunctions can, and likely do happen through no fault of the operator.  Again.  It is our disease to manage.
BTW - For the record, I have had to send several pumps back to the manufacture that were ALL covered under the warranty.  I don’t expect them to work perfectly every second of every day.  I do expect their warranties to do so.
Finally - for those of you who don’t speak Canadian, here is the US version of the story.

Insulin pumps have most reported problems in FDA database 35
DESTIN, Florida (AP) — When Polly Varnado's 9-year-old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, it didn't take long for the family to hear about insulin pumps. In September 2012, the girl picked out a purple one — her favorite color. Over the...

I gained a whole new insight into the customer service aspect of Insulet, which I suspect is not much different from any other insulin pump/medical supply company. Yes, they eventually replaced the PDM - and all the problems I was having went away immediately - but it was not without dogged determination on my part.
In my opinion, when I first called about the problem I was having, it should have raised a red flag on their end. When I continued to report the same problem, they should have assigned me to a team. There were only two possible reasons for the problems I was having: user error or product malfunction. In either case it is a product problem, if nothing more than the user is not adequately trained or equipped to use the technology.
So, I went round and round until I insisted they send a new PDM, calling them repeatedly with volumes of “data” I collected to “document” my claim that the PDM was malfunctioning.

Sure, it may sometimes not give the amount of insulin we want, but that is because we told it to. In other words, we need to perfect our carb ratios & basal rates (and “perfect” is a state that is continuously changing and we will probably never find), as well as enter the correct number of carbs (another thing that is nearly impossible to do). If you were not using an insulin pump, what would the amount of insulin you do through injections in comparison to how much you do with your pump? And as for CGM, it is definitely true that they are not 100% accurate and sometimes need calibrated, but the fact that they allow us to do stuff (almost) continuously is a major improvement. Pretty much every device used for anything (whether it be medical, construction, cooking, or anything else) will have occasional problems.

Of course I didn’t always do that if the only problem was a crack…but that was at my own risk. I always have Lantus or another basal insulin on hand as a backup at home, and I had to use it when one pump (due to shipping issues) took three days to get to me. I develop high BG and ketones very quickly when disconnected (two hours without insulin and my BG will be in the mid 20s and high ketones), but I have never gone into DKA in 12 years of pumping, in large part because I correct highs with a syringe if there’s any doubt that the pump or infusion set isn’t working.",Nov '18

I am just asking that they restrict the placement of them.

195,Blogging on TuDiabetes is changing,TuDiabetes Website,TuDiabetes Website,EmilyCRegular,,"As we move TuDiabetes to its new home we are changing the way blog posts appear in the community.  In the new design of TuDiabetes we will curate blog posts about life with diabetes from other sources, outside of the TuDiabetes website.  Blogs that are written by members of TuDiabetes who want to post them on the website will go in a forum category called ""Member stories"", instead of within a separate blog area.What does that mean?It means that in the new blogs section we will be collecting great posts from other websites - including This is Caleb 3, Test Guess and Go 2, and Sweet Success 2, among many others -  then highlighting them on the Blog page of TuDiabetes. In case you haven’t seen it, here is what we expect the new Blog page to look like.Why keep a blog?A blog is a great way to share your story and perspective.  With a blog you can keep a journal and share your experiences. You can comment on the news and other happenings and share your opinions with the world. A blog gives you a vehicle for making your voice heard.You control what goes up on your blog. Blog posts can be as long, or as short, as you want. You can format the text to appear the way you want. And you can include pictures and videos, giving you a rich communications platform.There are two different types of blogs. One is to report to others how you feel, what you think or what you experience. For instance how did the doctor visit go or what did you see on vacation. This is the most common type of blog and is often very interesting to friends, family members and people you work with.The second type of blog is sometimes called an issue blog. Often these blogs speak to issues, offer your opinion or report facts. In addition to the people listed in the report blog the issue blog might interest people who value your opinion, or who look to you for information.In addition to the two main types of blogs, a typical blog might include variants of each main type. The form and purpose of the blog you choose to write is your choice. Often however the type of blog will dictate the amount of readership that follows your blog. General issue blogs have more readership but take a great deal of time to get noticed, while a personal blog usually has a readymade but more limited readership.How do you set up a blog?For the beginner, I suggest starting with a free blog hosting service. This will let you set up a simple blog by following step-by-step instructions at no cost.  The two most popular services that host blogs for FREE are Wordpress and Blogger. Of course these free sites have some limits, but for a beginner they offer more than enough features and data storage. Wordpress.com also offers a premium (for-money) account that will have more features and data storage. This comes in handy when the blog grows and the blogger becomes more sophisticated. You can find the premium prices for Wordpress here.Blogger is run by Google so some people feel that using Blogger results in some kind of advantage in search.If you’re not sure which blog hosting service you want to use, here’s a recent article comparing Wordpres.com and Blogger. Of course, since these sites are free, you can also just try them out and then decide which one you want to use.Get started with WordpressGet started with BloggerHow do you set your blog up so that the folks at TuDiabetes can read your latest post easily? 1.  Set up a feed. This means that people (not just the folks at TuDiabetes, but anybody on the Internet) can, in essence, subscribe to your blog. Every time you publish a post on your blog the feed broadcasts a notice to your subscribers that there’s something new to read from you. Read more about feeds and how they work.How to set up a feed on WordpressHow to set up a feed on Blogger 12.  Include a link to your blog in your TuDiabetes member profile.Writing a blog is a great way to make your voice heard, both on TuDiabetes and in the greater Diabetes Online Community. Be sure to list a link to your blog in your member profile to make it easier for people to find.  Every time another members views your profile, your blog link will appear. ",Mar '15

This is a very poor idea and there has to be some actual content above the fold. Otherwise only experienced users will ever do anything other than look at the lossy forum page and give up.
I would usually follow the rule of thumb that the site logo doesn’t take more than 10-15% of the screen when you load it. Prominent but tasteful at the top is fine.
The way the logo is designed it makes a very poor use of screen space (vast majority of screen is just white empty space).

While I understand the appeal of handwriting style fonts, they are often not super functional, so I might suggest considering a different font (or at least a more legible handwriting font if you really want that). Also, I agree about the yellow issue—while it looks nice highlighting the black text, the notifications for messages are now in yellow on white background with white numbers, and do not show up well due to having hardly any contrast. I would suggest only using deeper colors for that function (from the palette provided, the blue and salmon would be fine, or possibly adding another splash color).

Waay too much Heavy, depressing Black to greet one on the opening page


I think that is a fair point.  On the forum page, turning the column header to a black background with white lettering causes (IMHO) an unnatural focus on the column headers.  Which in reality need very little attention.  It is overbearing and distracting.
From a focus perspective, trying to glance from the white on black header to the black on white posts is not an entirely pleasant visual experience.

IT professionals were dispatched to address this issue. In efforts to resolve this, some coding issues from our extensive migration from Ning were uncovered. This extended the time it took to correct the matter. Beyond this it gets more technical than I can properly speak to.
The site has returned to one with https in its domain and is again secure.",Oct '17
262,Back online - thanks for your patience!,TuDiabetes Website,TuDiabetes Website,Eric2,,"Formerly, TuD was using HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). Now they are using HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
By using HTTPS, the communication between your browser and the web server is encrypted so that no one in between can read it. This helps keep your communication safer.
There may have been other changes that were made, but the switch to the secure protocol was the most obvious.
As you can see here, they are still not setting both the Secure and HttpOnly flag for all cookies, which would be preferable if the cookie does not need to be accessed by any legitimate JavaScript.

And as I mentioned here, they should also eliminate support for TLS v1.0.




TUD Site - Now Functional Community


    Yes, they did at least remove the insecure HTTP communication they were using before. Now it is running with HTTPS which means they are encrypting traffic between the browser and the website. 
But they are still using TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 for browser compatibility reasons. No reason. Chrome v30 and up, Firefox v27 and up, and IE v11 and up all support TLS 1.2. 
I guess the only reason they are keeping TLS 1.0 is for the people using Windows 98 or XP.  
Support for TLS 1.0 should be re…

Miscellaneous
In the event that any portion of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such portion shall be construed in accordance with the applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. This section, the section entitled Indemnification, and the section entitled Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability and Intellectual Property shall survive the termination of these Terms of Use. You may not assign these Terms of Use. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing. Neither the course of conduct between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use and any other agreements between the parties entered into through the Sites shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”).  Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA.  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website http://www.jamsadr.com. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect our proprietary interests.
You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
These Terms of Use contain the entire agreement of the parties concerning its subject matter, and supersede all existing agreements and all other oral, written or other communication between the parties concerning the subject matter.

I understand that Beyond Type 1 is a different organization than D Hands Foundation, so I assume this is also posted to provide some legal backstop for BT1.
Here are three things in the Privacy Policy which, while not particularly unusual, remind me why I do not share more than I do online, including on sites like this.
We may share Usage Information about you with third parties for ad distribution and ad optimization (defined as the tailoring, targeting (i.e., behavioral, contextual, and retargeting), analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing of ads). These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such Other Information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us, and these third-parties, to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the website on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site.
There are some potential, sort-of opt-outs but the default is to share Usage Info as stated.
If we or all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal information, would be transferred along with our other business assets.
I would feel more assured if there was some language here about how BT1’s information about its users/members would be held confidential by the acquiring organization/company, but apparently there is no commitment to that.
We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases.
Does “commercially reasonable” mean anything?  In the last two years I have had three well-known, large commercial  entities electronically breached and my electronic/personal data in their possession potentially compromised.  So really, why bother with this statement.
In addition, Beyond Type 1 does not monitor, recognize, or honor any opt-out or do not track mechanisms, including general web browser “Do Not Track” settings and/or signals.
This rather contradicts any well-meaning of the opt-out clause above.

We at Beyond Type 1 (“Beyond Type 1,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Beyond Type 1 in connection with our Services, which are made available through our Sites.
Description of Users and Acceptance of Terms
This Privacy Policy applies to visitors to the Sites, who view only publicly-available content (“Visitors”), and individuals who have registered to use our Services as members (“Members”).
By visiting our Sites, Visitors are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use. By accessing and/or using the Services, each Member is agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use.
Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)


Overview
Although our Pen Pal Program is directed towards children under the age of 13, we are a 501© (3) non-profit organization and are exempt from compliance with COPPA.  Nevertheless, we do care deeply about privacy of children under the age of 13 and choose to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13 within the spirit of COPPA. For more information about COPPA and your child’s rights to online privacy, visit the Children’s Privacy section of the FTC’s website.
This Privacy Policy describes our information practices for personal information collected online from all of our users, including those under the age of 13.


Consent.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13 without first obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or guardian (“Parental Consent”), except for the limited amount of personally identifiable information we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent such as child’s name, parent’s or guardian’s name, parent’s or guardian’s phone number and parent’s or guardian’s email address (“Required Information”). We will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent. In order to obtain Parental Consent, we will email your parent or guardian with direct notice about what information we are collecting, how we plan to use it, how your parent or guardian can provide consent, and how your parent or guardian can revoke consent (“Notice”). We will also provide a link to our Privacy Policy in our Notice.  If we do not receive Parental Consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the Required Information we received from you. If your parent or guardian provides Parental Consent, we will send a confirmation email confirming their consent and advising them how they can revoke their consent.  If you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to send any personal information about yourself to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except for the Required Information in the context of the Parental Consent process. If you believe that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at hello@beyondtype1.org. We do not condition participation in our Pen Pal Program on disclosure of more personal information from a child under 13 than is reasonably necessary for that participation, and we do not retain personal information from children under 13 longer than is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was disclosed.


Changing or Deleting Personal Information About Children Under 13
At any time, parents or guardians can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their children under 13 and can request that any personal information that we have collected be deleted from our records.  Parents or guardians can contact us to access, change, or delete the personal information that we have collected from their children by sending an e-mail to hello@beyondtype1.org.  Please include the children’s name and the parent’s e-mail address in the e-mail so that we can better assist you with your inquiry or request.


Before responding to any request to review personal information collected from children under 13, we may require that the requester follow reasonable procedures to help verify his or her identity as the child’s parent or guardian.  We may deny any request that fails to follow these procedures.  Please note that if you choose to have your child’s personal information deleted, or refuse to permit further collection or use of your child’s personal information, your child may not be able to participate in our Pen Pal Program.

Sure. One caveat is that I’m doing this from desktop and haven’t tried it from a mobile device. I think that should work more or less the same way but there are a lot of variables there. Anyway…
The initial screen lets you set a couple of parameters: you can resize the image if your original is oversized/hi-res and set an expiration if you only need it to be available temporarily. Mostly I assume you’d want to use “No expiration” for anything you’re posting here but the re-sizing options might be handy. They contain descriptors (avatar image, thumbnail, message board etc) that make that pretty self-explanatory.
Then hit “Choose images” to select the one(s) you want from your local files. This uploads your image and gives you a choice of ways to link to it. Simplest one is the second, “Direct link.” The way the TUD system works, if you just copy that link and paste it into your post, the image should automatically appear, as in this picture of my beautiful granddaughter:

306,CMS coverage for CGMS,TuDiabetes Website,TuDiabetes Website,KAK,2,"Decision Moves Continuous Glucose Monitors One Step Closer to Medicare Coverage
January 12, 2017
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices approved by the FDA for use in making diabetes treatment decisions are durable medical equipment, according to a decision today by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). That determination removed a major roadblock to the devices’ coverage under Medicare. Today’s decisions mean that CGMs approved by the FDA for use in making diabetes treatment decisions are eligible for reimbursement under Medicare.
Today’s decision creates a pathway for Medicare coverage for the devices that will bring the nation’s largest insurer in line with the vast majority of the country’s private payers. Although the significant benefits of CGM use have been known since 2008, CMS had previously refused to consider covering the devices under Medicare, saying they did not meet the statutory definitions of durable medical equipment or any other category the agency could cover. Today’s decision removes that impediment.
“JDRF is encouraged by this decision, which will bring us closer to Medicare coverage for continuous glucose monitors,” said Aaron J. Kowalski, PhD, JDRF’s Chief Mission Officer. “I want to thank the tireless JDRF advocates and Congressional champions who have made this progress possible.”
JDRF has been the leading advocate for widespread adoption of CGM technologies to manage T1D and for public and private payer coverage for their purchase and use. JDRF has spearheaded the drive to obtain Medicare coverage for CGM devices, marshalling research, expert testimony, allied organizations, and JDRF advocates from across the nation. JDRF met numerous times with officials at CMS and with others in the executive branch to urge them to provide access to this life-changing technology using the agency’s existing authority. At the same time, JDRF engaged Congress, persuading 50 Senators and 275 Representatives to support legislation to require Medicare to provide CGM coverage.
JDRF wants to thank everyone who made today’s decision possible, especially the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Diabetes Caucus co-chairs Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Representative Tom Reed (R-NY), and Representative Diana DeGette (D-CO), our Congressional supporters, our allies, and the thousands of JDRF advocates who made their voices heard in Washington, D.C.
Today’s decision was more than a decade in the making. In 2006, JDRF launched a multi-center clinical trial that conclusively demonstrated that CGM use improved health outcomes for people with T1D of all ages, including reduced HbA1c levels, increased time in range, and a significant drop in incidents of hypoglycemia. The results from that trial led to national diabetes clinical organizations changing their treatment guidelines for T1D to recommend CGM use and to broad coverage of the technologies by most private insurers. Today’s recognition of CGMs as durable medical equipment is just one example of the advances JDRF has been able to achieve for the T1D community because of our unique position as a trusted advisor to lawmakers, government administrators and health care thought leaders.
JDRF is heartened by today’s decision and will continue to work as necessary to ensure robust coverage of CGMs for people with T1D on Medicare. We look forward to working with the incoming Congress and administration to ensure broad and affordable access to exciting new T1D therapies like the artificial pancreas systems and to advance the interests of the T1D community at every level.
Why is it important?
CGMs enable superior blood-glucose management for people with T1D. Because they sense glucose levels every five minutes, night and day, they allow users to see whether their levels are trending high or low before they become dangerous. Extensive clinical evidence shows that CGM use significantly improves diabetes management, enabling users to avoid potentially deadly low blood-sugar crises (hypoglycemia) and the devastating long-term complications associated with chronic high blood-sugar (hyperglycemia). Insulin-dependent seniors in particular are at elevated risk for hypoglycemia, leading not only to bad health outcomes, but increased use of costly emergency room visits and hospitalizations. The government’s refusal to recognize CGMs as durable medical equipment meant they couldn’t be considered for coverage under Medicare, forcing those with T1D who rely on such coverage—even those who had been successfully managing their disease with the devices when they were covered by private insurance—to pay out-of-pocket for CGMs or go without.

318,Newly diagnosed Type 1,Welcome,Welcome,lainey683,,"Hi All - I’m a newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetic and I’m delighted to find this community. I got diagnosed in late October after experiencing recurrent yeast infections - I went into urgent care, which revealed high glucose in my urine, and a finger stick pegged me at 309 ml/dl. I am a 37 year old woman, very active with a normal BMI and a family history of autoimmune disorders. An A1C of 14+ and GAD antibody test confirmed my Type 1 diagnosis.
In hindsight, I really should have noticed that losing five pounds in quarantine, despite eating everything in sight, was too good to be true  I gained 8 pounds in my first week of starting insulin. I feel much better already.
I’ve had initial meetings with an endocrinologist, diabetes nurse, and nutritionist. The nutritionist was really pushing me to eat more carbs. (I went strict keto after my diagnosis and before getting my insulin, then ate low carb, roughly 50-100 net carbs a day, in my first few weeks). I have been trying to eat higher carb these last few weeks (aiming for 200g net carbs/day), but I’ve noticed poorer sugar control as a result.
I’m currently using Levemir as my long acting, and Humalog for fast acting, along with a Freestyle Libre meter. I just started a new job where I’ll have better health insurance, and so I’ll likely get a Dexcom and possibly a pump early next year.
Everything is a bit overwhelming right now - blood sugar seems to be affected by so many different variables. I’m a bit of a data nerd and very willing to comply with the right diet, but I feel like there’s so much to tackle at once. Every day seems to be an unrepeatable experiment - even my basal insulin needs seem to vary daily with things like my menstrual cycle. I would love any tips from this group on what to tackle first in terms of figuring out my diabetes.",12d

320,Newly diagnosed Type 1,Welcome,Welcome,Stemwinder_GaryType 2,1,"Eat more carbs and less fat is the standard mantra of the majority of nutritionist. It is part of their crusade to rid our diets of what they have deemed to be the evil fats. This is the advice they give to everyone, not just diabetics.
This advice just seems wrong for a diabetic, consuming large amounts of carbs makes controlling blood glucose more difficult for many of us. No one says you must avoid carbs like the plague, make your own choices about how much you wish to consume, taking into account how well you can control the blood glucose that comes with them.  Some people do well consuming a normal amount of carbs, others find they must limit them to keep their BG in control.",12d

Sorry to hear about the diagnosis. We’ve all been there though 
I think you’ll see all the T1’s say “WHAT??” to the advice to eat more carbs! Did they say that this was temporary? Perhaps its to keep you safer in case the honeymoon period kicks in unexpectedly?
In the long term, most folks will say to try and limit carbs- it definitely makes control much easier.
You are 100% correct with this statement:  “Every day seems to be an unrepeatable experiment”. I’ve never heard it stated more clearly! T1 is a moving target. You’ll always be adjusting and tweaking insulin, and you’ll make a LOT of mistakes. Just be ready for it, and know that its not easy.

recurrent yeast infections


Yup. This is a thing. Infections will be more common with high BG.



 lainey683:

The nutritionist was really pushing me to eat more carbs


Yeah, they kinda have a set diet plan that they start people on.
Are they telling you to deliver the same amount of insulin at each meal?
They are prob just trying to get you through this period of adjustment.
Down the line, once you get a handle on the basics, you will have more freedom.
They don’t want to overwhelm people who are newly diagnosed with too much complexity.



 lainey683:

Yup. This is how its gonna be for a while. Getting a Dexcom will help a lot in figuring out patterns.
Your insulin dosages are prob not finely tuned yet. We will be able to work with you on that. Give yourself a little time to adjust and get to know how your body operates. That’s ok. It sounds like your doing a really good job. But, you will learn and get better over time.",12d

Its not as fast acting as they say!  Test your BG to see how it works for you.  Many wait 15-30 minutes before eating.  Longer if high bg before meal, eating non-carby foods first.
Do you recognize feelings of going low?
Consider a freestyle libre cgm, if dexcom not covered.",12d
324,Newly diagnosed Type 1,Welcome,Welcome,Marilyn6,1,"See Mastering Diabetes for a diet low in fat and high in good carbs. I eat close to 275 carbs daily have a A1c of 5.2.
When I started following Dr Bernstein about 15 yrs ago almost NOBODY was eating low carb. Slowly this way of eating has caught on. I followed Dr.Bernstein for 11 yrs and think that he is great, BUT, this way of eating made me very, very ill. My Alc was 4.6, my HDL was 100, but my LDL was close to 200. I am well aware that some people don’t think high LDL matters, but it did for me. While on Bernstein’s woe I suddenly needed two heart stents. I had had very few diabetic complications at this time after 52 yrs of diabetes. That was 10 yrs ago. I also developed very low blood pressure and severe migraines. My husband called an ambulance several times because I would pass out and hit my head.
Since being on a low fat plant based diet, my LDL is way down and I no longer pass out and I have had 1 migraine in 4 yrs.
PLEASE don’t discourage people from finding out about low fat, plant based diets.
I think the  low carb diet works well for many people and it did for me until it didn’t, but some people can be harmed by this way of eating. A high carb diet with low fat is a very healthy way to eat. People have fewer heart problems and cancer.
Yes, it takes a while to adjust, but the change over is fairly easy to make. It also requires exercise, which is great for all of us.
Because eating a very low fat diet greatly lowers insulin resistance, I take almost the same amount of insulin now as I did when eating very low carb. A total of 23 units daily.",12d
325,Newly diagnosed Type 1,Welcome,Welcome,Timothy,1,"Eating more carb and more insulin protects you from  keto acidosis. However once you get on a long acting insulin, it is not really an issue anymore.
So this might be old school thinking on the part of your doctor.
I try to stick to 100 carbs a day and I often go over but that’s my goal.
It’s not really even low carb.
Your doctor suggests 200. That’s a lot of carb. Even for a non diabetic.
It is doable if you dose correctly and you are getting g lots of exercise.
When I was younger I did two marathons, I would eat 400 grams of carb and taking regular insulin.
No cgm I would do finger sticks while running. Sweat mixing in w blood. No idea how I managed.
But I completed 2.
I crashed in mile 21 but took a small break and ate sugar and continued.
Kind of stupid looking back but there were no rules back then. No plan. We just did the best we could.
So really you need to eat as much carb as you feel is right.
It takes a long time to figure out your insulin needs and since you are newly diagnosed you might be making some insulin still and that makes it tougher.",12d

Nope, no painful bumps. My TDD ranges between ~55-70 units. I’m currently using my old MT Paradigm 723, and yes, it is designed to do very slow, gradual delivery, so maybe that’s why.

I haven’t had Type 2 diabetes for very long, just a few months. I got it from having a poor diet and sedentary lifestyle, and though my heart sank when I was diagnosed, I wasn’t altogether surprised.
My doctor is, naturally, strongly encouraging me to cut out sugary sodas, eat far less fast food, and walk a fair bit more than I already do to and from work.
I’ve had limited success giving up sodas. Having a boyfriend who keeps bringing the stuff home doesn’t help, but I know that’s not a good excuse - I can just say no, water/tea/coffee is fine. But there’s something satisfying about that carbonated beverage feeling. I have been remembering more often than not to get sugar-free drinks like Zevia, or at the very least, Coke Zero. (I tried La Croix water - BLEH. Bubly is not too bad, maybe I’ll get that next time). I often settle for other Diet crap if I have to while dining out, but I don’t prefer it, and I hear it’s not much better for you than the sugary stuff anyway.
Working on diet and exercise is the next bigger hurdle. I’ve been hearing this and that about keto - but I’m not thrilled about going whole-hog for a strict diet. Incremental changes are probably what will win the day, and I think that’s all the doctor is looking for, too. She suggested I just eat at home more often, and track food and exercise on MyFitnessPal. As for exercise, I just need to get off the damn sofa and walk, especially while it’s still warm out.
Sorry for my ramblings, just giving a summation of where I’m at presently. Any advice would be appreciated.",Sep '19

It’s tough to examine all the habits in your life with an eye toward giving them up. That’s usually well beyond the will-power of most people. While I battle T1D, the motivational landscape is similar to any health situation best served by behavioral changes.
The tough one is the way of eating. People fiercely resist changing their eating style. Even raising the topic with someone is akin to talking about changing their politics or religion. It’s highly personal. When I was diagnosed 35 years ago, I was eating sugary cereal each morning for breakfast and drank several sugar sodas every day. I was 30 years old at the time.
When I first became aware that reducing carbohydrate consumption helped many people manage their blood glucose, it took me two years and a significant diabetes complication diagnosis for me to give a carb-limited way of eating a chance.
It’s one of the best things I’ve ever done and I’m disappointed in myself that it took me 28 years to make that change. It was, however, easier to make and sustain that change than I thought. It’s been 7 years now and it’s allowed me to lose significant weight, cut my insulin consumption in half, and bring some much-need metabolic sanity to my life. I would never choose to go back to my former way of eating,
Life has asked you to consider wholesale changes to the way you live. Don’t try to do everything at once. Pick one aspect at a time and work on that. Healthy food changes would be great but if you don’t feel the motivational energy to tackle that, perhaps just making stick a new exercise habit will help you.",Sep '19
388,I’m a LADA too! I have a Love Hate relationship with my 670G!,Welcome,Welcome,GregSType 1 or LADA,1,"Hello All,
First time posting here but I’ve been lurking for a while since starting Auto Mode with my Minimed 670G in May 2018.
I’ll start with a little background about myself.  I’m a 55 year old male and was first diagnosed as type 2 back in 1997.  I should have done more research then.  Looking back, I believe I should have known that diagnoses was incorrect.  My Father was type 1 and so was his Father.  So, I was first taking Glyburide and when that didn’t get my BG low enough my Dr. added Metformin.  This, along with diet and exercise, worked for a while as my a1c was down around 6.5.  But gradually my control became worse and the dosing of diabetic meds was at max.  I was made to believe that I just needed to try harder.  As the years went by, I got more disillusioned and my Dr. was calling me non-compliant!  So frustrating.  May of '05, my Wife and Son and I moved to Oregon to be closer to My parents.  Shortly thereafter, I started seeing a Doctor here and my a1c was 11!  He said he could tell by looking at me that I was not type 2.  So he started me on Humalog and Lantus MDI.  Again, I did ok for a while.  My a1c was down around 6 for a couple of years but I struggled with hypoglycemia, especially at night.  So I would get up and over correct and my BG would be high for the whole day.   My a1c kept creeping up and my Endocrinologist (same one my Dad was seeing) would try to get me to be more diligent.  I think a lot of damage was done when I was being treated as a type 2 and not being close to “in control”.  So I am now a very “brittle” diabetic.  I found another Endo years after my Dad’s endo decided to quit his practice.  My new doctor told me about the Minimed 670G, so after figuring out how to pay for the supplies, I decided to give it a go starting May 2018.  My new endo also told me about LADA and said that my history indicates that I’m in that category.   So, after 9 months with the 670G, I can say that it has helped me to get a much better handle on my control.  I have very few lows.  The CGM does a great job of letting me know when I’m headed south so that I can start correcting before feeling like I’m about to die!  My last a1c was 6.9 and the one before that was 7.0  I LOVE my 670G when it works as expected.  I HATE it when things go wrong like when Dawn Phenomenon causes my BG to creep up and the sensor doesn’t follow. A finger stick in the morning indicates a BG of 180 but the sensor says 150!  Fortunately, I think I’m getting a handle on this and the DP is a little better lately.  I think I Love my pump more often that I hate it.  Hope I haven’t bored you all to much with my long winded story, but that’s my diabetes in a nut shell.
I look forward to participating here and hearing from others about struggles and successes .

Yes, I’ve recently started with the new transmitter.  My Medtronics sales rep recommended the updated transmitter due to the fact that I was struggling with the “Loop of Death”.  Frequently, when starting a new sensor, my BG was not stable when calibrating for the first time.  This caused the pump to require new BG to start or stay in auto mode. The new trasmitter seems to help with the ""BG Required trouble but unfortunately it doesn’t seem to help with DP.  The only things that do help are being careful with timing and contents of dinner meal and limiting late evening snacks.  I’ve also reduced the AIT  setting from 4 to 3hrs.  We’ll see if that helps.

That’s about when I got my upgrade to the 670G, and I have been using the new transmitter since it became available as well.



 GregS:

A finger stick in the morning indicates a BG of 180 but the sensor says 150!


I have noticed this kind of thing as well. Several things I do that help keep the sensor & meter BG in sync are:

Wait 20-30 minutes after getting up (actually out of bed) before attempting to calibrate or eat breakfast. I often do this by doing other morning activities such as getting dressed or possibly preparing for the rest of the day.
Always wait 20-30 minutes after showers before attempting to calibrate. Something I often do is calibrate before the shower rather than after. If I also need a correction bolus, let the calibration finish before doing the correction bolus. Then (if applicable) do the meal bolus (or snack bolus, whatever the case may be) after the shower without doing another BG.
Do NOT do BGs at every meal, do BGs on a predetermined (or approximately the same time) schedule. This can be adjusted so that you NEVER do the calibration immediately (or soon after) after eating. This will prevent meals from causing calibration problems.
These things are things I never thought about doing, since with my previous pump (which did not have Auto Mode) I seemed to never have good or correct numbers.

That was the thing that finally broke me on the 670G and I went back to manual mode permanently. There didn’t seem to be a settings fix because the problem was the sensor, not the pump or the algorithm.
And yes, your misdiagnosis story is a very familiar one around here. It’s astonishing how often this happens, and blaming the patient for “noncompliance” or inadequate effort goes along with it. After decades of stats showing that nearly as many people get T1 in adulthood as get it as kids, you’d think they might stop doing this. It was the whole POINT of changing the designation to “Type 1” instead of “Juvenile.” But some fixed ideas are just really hard to change, even among professionals who should know better.

I think it’s a lot like raising kids.  A parent will find much more success when their child is praised for the things they are doing right more often than criticized for mistakes.

407,New Here! Starting a Journey to lower the numbers!,Welcome,Welcome,Terry4,1,"Welcome to TuD, @nasalu! Congratulations on taking ownership of your health and doing something about it. Keep up your efforts, if you slack off then your numbers will reflect that. This is a long game, not a temporary effort.
I use a low carb, high fat way of eating to help control my T1D. I’ve read many stories about people with T2D, using a keto diet, have reversed all symptoms of diabetes while they have come off of all medications, including insulin. Google “Virta Health” and “Heal Clinics” for more info.
You may not be able to reduce your A1c to < 6.1 at your next appointment, but that goal is definitely reachable if you persist in your newly adopted eating habits.
I’ve been eating low-carb, high fat for seven years now. It is sustainable; don’t let anyone tell you differently! Good luck and please stay in touch.",Mar '19

415,Greetings Tu Diabetes Community!,Welcome,Welcome,SweetHeather,13,"I’m Heather and have lived with T1D since 8 years of age. While I was diagnosed on October 15, 1978, I celebrate my diaversary on the 18th as that was when I awoke from the coma and found out that I had something they called “brittle juvenile diabetes.”
At the time, the doctors told me that I would be dead by 40, blind, with an amputation, and most likely on dialysis. This “death sentence” set me on an overly zealous path of self-destruction that I followed well into adulthood.  I spent first couple of decades with diabetes actively facilitating my demise.  And, doing a rather good job of it, I must add.
I thought I was rebelling against my diagnosis, only to find that I was actually rebelling against the chance of a good life. I held on to being extremely resentful of the doctors and their prognosis for many years, and yet to be fair; my diagnosis was 15 years before the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial demonstrated, how we manage diabetes REALLY does matter.
The past 20 years, or so, I have learned to embrace diabetes as part of what makes me, me.  It is my personal mission to help others overcome the obstacles and barriers to self-care and live well with diabetes.
Profoundly grateful to say that I am almost 10 years past “my expiration date,” with all of my body parts, and am living a Sweet Life with diabetes!

426,Welcome! We want to get to know you! Please tell us about yourself,Welcome,Welcome,eaglehawke185,5,"Hi — I’m Anthony and was originally diagnosed in January 2009 with Type 2 diabetes.
I was initially started on Metformin. Later in January 2010, due to protein in the urine, I was taken off Metformin and put on Gliclazide - 30 mg MR (modified release tablets), 2 tablets in the morning. In March 2012, I was started on Lantus (slow acting insulin injections twice daily).
Due to my A1C continuing to be high at 11.8. I was started on October 2014 on Novolog fast acting insulin using Medtronic Min-Med Insulin Pump.  A few months after using the Medtronic Min-Med insulin pump, I moved on to the Asante Snap insulin pump that made a huge difference as it took a pre-filled insulin cartridge and was quick and easy to manage while travelling instead of drawing insulin in a syringe and then filling the reservoir in the insulin pump, Unfortunately Asante went out of business.
In November 2015, I moved to the Omni pod insulin pod system. This system uses a tubeless blue tooth enabled Pod to deliver insulin. This was the best system as I did not have to worry about the tubes getting caught up and pulling out the insertion as on the Medtronic Medi-med or the Ashanti Snap insulin pump that both used a tube system. In December 2016, I was started on Dexcom CGM Continuous Glucose Monitor which allowed me to see how I was trending and was able to adjust my insulin intake to better control my blood glucose levels.  After being on Omni pod insulin pod system and the Dexcom CGM, my A1C dropped to 6.8.
I look forward to learning and contributing to the Forum.

I’ve said many times that I think parents of T1s, especially very young kids, have a much harder time of it than the patients themselves. Every instinct you have tells you it’s your job to protect your kid and make sure they’re ok, which can make every BG spike or hypo feel like a judgment on your whole value as a parent. That way lies madness, of course, or at least a severe case of burnout. Nobody ever gets it perfectly right all the time, and it’s really important to get that perspective from other parents who know how it feels!

451,Wheat Allergy,Welcome,Welcome,Terry4,2,I agree with your doctor that a wheat allergy is different from Celiac. Allergic reactions and its associated inflammation do impact health. Allergies may also interfere with healthy nutrient absorption in the gut.,Mar '19
452,Wheat Allergy,Welcome,Welcome,JenType 1 or LADA,2,"Yes, celiac disease and a wheat allergy are different. Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition wherein the immune system attacks the small intestine in the presence of gluten. A gastroenterologist would diagnose celiac disease through a blood test and a biopsy. An wheat allergy is a specific immune system reaction against wheat (not gluten) and is diagnosed through a history of acute reactions, blood tests, and skin tests. An allergist would diagnose a wheat allergy. A gastroenterologist may be involved in diagnosing some very rare types of food allergies through biopsies.
True food allergies tend to cause very specific reactions and often severe symptoms. It is also possible to have an intolerance or sensitivity to food that does not involve the immune system. These tend to produce more vague symptoms, and there is currently no specific test to diagnose intolerances or sensitivities.
I was tested for celiac disease after my diagnosis with Type 1 diabetes in 1991. I’ve been tested twice again since then. All have been negative. However, about five years ago I was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis, a rare type of food allergy, and wheat is one of the foods that triggers this reaction for me.

510,New from Minnesota,Welcome,Welcome,Amy57,1,"Good morning! I’ve been reading these forums obsessively the past couple of days so wanted to check in, also I have a few questions. Maybe some of you have had a similar experience and can help?
I’ve been dx as type 2 for past 2.5 years, treated with 500mg of Metformin from my clinic on my worksite. Been doing ok, but noticed past couple of months BG creeping up. The past month I’ve been exhausted, pee frequently, tired and sick feeling all the time. I just assumed this was either stress, depression, laziness or some other failure on my part that would eventually be corrected when I lose the weight I’ve been trying to dump for decades. 
I also noticed that my bg in the past week (had not been checking faithfully before) were hanging out in the 350s a lot and occasionally hitting 400. Can you tell I what a brain fog I was in? I didn’t even notice.
Anyway, finally decided to bite the bullet and see an endo. He wasn’t too excited about me, and was very dismissive of what my meter was saying. He said my last A1C (a month ago) of 6.1 was just prediabetes. I finally showed the doctor my last reading of 364 and they agreed to do a fsg a1c in the office. It was 8.2, up from a month. He got interested then and stated I was experiencing glucotoxicity and was likely type 1/LADA.  He’s going to do some labs in a couple weeks but in the meantime he’s started me on Lantus.
I thought I was understanding everything the endo was telling me, but now I realize coming up with this Lantus dose is quite confusing. I’m to start with 10U and adjust +/- 2U with a 50 pt rise or fall.
I do often eat a late dinner, ~8pm with “lunch” at 3pm. Dr. told me not to worry about that as long as I don’t snack before bedtime. I guess I should have clarified as my late dinners are within a couple hours of my bedtime.
Last night I was 264 at bedtime and woke up at 289. FYI - before I ate I was at 160. Should I move up my dinner and be consistent with the time?
My next appt is in 6 weeks with a lab draw in a couple weeks. Does anyone have any idea what I might expect at the next appt? Don’t I need injections after my meals as well? Is he just waiting to sort out the basal dose first?
Also I should say that I felt better over the weekend then I have in a long long time!
I would welcome any comments or suggestions if you’ve read this far!
THANK YOU!",Dec '18
511,New from Minnesota,Welcome,Welcome,Tim35Parent of a Type 1,5,"@Amy57
Six weeks sounds like a long time with the BG that you are talking about.
I would suggest to call your Endo and ask for a sooner appointment.  This week would be much better.  You comment about a fast-acting insulin with meals (in addition to the long acting  Lantus) would certainly make sense to be a primary topic of conversation with your Endo.
If your Endo is not able to see you for six weeks, I would suggest calling another Endo and request an appt this week.",Dec '18
512,New from Minnesota,Welcome,Welcome,meeeType 1 or LADA,2,Your bg is way too high. I would find a doc who will do tests right away (if you can) and put you on bolus and basal insulin asap.,Dec '18
513,New from Minnesota,Welcome,Welcome,typ1,1,"Email your results from your reports and or cgm.  Then followup later that day with a call,  one of my endo when he was adjusting my insulin had me call him  every 2 days even at home.  he gave out his home number.  he said he never had a problem with patient calls.
i forgot about hippa.  Send your results though a hospital portal or clinic portal if the doc is associated with one,  or see if he/she has has a secure fax machine in his unit.",Dec '18
514,New from Minnesota,Welcome,Welcome,TapestryType 1 or LADA,1,"I’m wondering … if the endo won’t schedule you sooner, if a trip to the ER might get them (the endo) to see you sooner and the ER might administer insulin to bring you into a good range?
Also, going low/no carb until you meet with the endo will definitely help.  Exercise will help a lot to bring down your numbers.
There are a few great books to help get you started - as well as asking here!  The DOC (Diabetes Online Community) is wonderful in helping to sort through a great deal, from newly diagnosed, un/under diagnosed, and those who have 50+ years in.
The books are …
Dr. Bernstein’s Diabetes Solution by Dr. Richard Bernstein
His website is http://www.diabetes-book.com
Think Like a Pancreas by Gary Scheiner
His website is https://integrateddiabetes.com/
And, John Walsh’s (with a few other authors) Using Insulin and Pumping Insulin.
Edited to add:  You don’t want to stay that high for any length of time.",Dec '18
515,New from Minnesota,Welcome,Welcome,Babs5,1,"What are your fasting blood sugar levels?
You are on a fairly low dose of Metformin.
When first going on insulin, basal (long acting like Lantus) or bolus (fast acting like Novolog or Fiasp) with meals, you do need to adjust until you and your doc find the proper amount of either or both insulin types.
You certainly don’t want to crash with a really bad LOW, but considering the levels you mentioned, it sounds like you may need to be a little more aggressive getting to the proper levels of insulin.
Please keep in touch with us and let us know how you progress.
I would be interested in your daily levels, fasting, pre-meal, and post meal more than your A1C at this point in time.  An A1C is an average over time and will not indicate spikes.  Someone can have a fairly good A1C if they are going really high and then dropping really low and averaging out.  If you are having mealtime spikes, you may need a fast acting insulin more than a long acting insulin.  (or both)
Another test you may ask to have done is a GlycoMark.  It is a better indicator of mealtime spikes.
If your levels are always high, even without food as a factor, then you definitely need a long acting insulin, like Lantus.
10 units seems to be a VERY conservative starting point with the levels you mentioned, but one that is a textbook guideline starting point.
Did your doc mention WHAT labs he is ordering?
I know your fingers may not like it, but if you test first thing in the morning (fasting), again before breakfast, (if you eat breakfast), before every meal, and two hours after each meal for 3 days, you will get a better idea of whether you are in need of fast acting meal time insulin or if you need long acting insulin.
Since your meals are later in the day and evening, testing before bedtime sounds more like a 2 hour post meal level.  If I were you, I wouldn’t bother with a bedtime test if it is close to your last meal.
Be sure you use the Lantus around the same time each day.
I will be looking to hear from you so please keep in touch often.
One last thing, ask your doc if he has a CGM that he can have you use for a week so you both can see what your levels are doing throughout the day and night.  They usually have a “blind” one they use for this purpose.  The patient doesn’t get to see the results until the doctor sees them.",Dec '18
516,New from Minnesota,Welcome,Welcome,Amy57,2,"I appreciate all the kind and thoughtful replies, as well as your concern. It is much appreciated.
This past week I’ve been sick with a cold, and with me those always come with a really horrific cough. Maybe that contributed to the high BG, but the combo together wiped me out. Wednesday evening I woke up to being somewhere in the 400s but so tired and foggy I couldn’t even manage to try to make a doctor’s appt and I considered going to the ER. I ended up drinking a lot of water and just sleeping it off. Left a message for the doctor on Thursday, a nurse called me back asking for some numbers…I still haven’t gotten a response from the office
The cold has cleared but I just don’t understand the numbers. I’ve started reading Think Like a Pancreas (thanks for that suggestion!) and I do wear the Freestyle Libre (started over the summer because I was curious how food impacted the numbers).
I don’t seem to have any kind of plateau or flat line, it just goes up and down in waves between 200-400.
I’m going to watch my mealtime schedule better starting tomorrow and move dinnertime up and pay attention to those numbers.
I’ll let you know how it goes.

If your BG remains above 400 for 2+ hours, then I strongly suggest you immediately go to the Rochester, Minnesota Mayo Clinic Emergency Room.
Have somebody else drive you.
Regardless of where you live and what other places are closer, this is the most appropriate place to go.
Tell them your Endo said he might be able to schedule an appt in about six weeks but that you thought the situation was more urgent.  At that point, let the ER Docs at the Mayo Clinic diagnose and treat you.
This can not wait six weeks.",Dec '18
520,New from Minnesota,Welcome,Welcome,Terry4,,"You’ve received lots of good advice here, @Amy57. You seem to be aware that a late meal is not the best choice for people living with diabetes. When you eat that close to bed-time your body must continue the work of digestion during your initial sleep period instead of getting complete rest and time to make needed repairs. I try to eat at least three hours before sleeping. I find much better overnight blood glucose control. I also get better numbers first thing in the morning.
Keep up with asking questions and making your measurements. It can be informative to write down your numbers. You don’t have to do this forever, but in the short run will help you learn about your glucose metabolism more quickly.
Your were smart to start using the Libre. Good luck!",Dec '18
521,New from Minnesota,Welcome,Welcome,Stemwinder_GaryType 2,2,"While your Endo mentioned the possibility of LADA the insulin plan you have been given sounds exactly like what was given to me, I am T2.
There are a lot of T1/LADA that were misdiagnosed as T2 but sometimes the diagnosis was correct. It is good that you have an endo willing to consider both possibilities.
From a T2 perspective what your endo is doing is appropriate, I suspect that it is also appropriate for an LADA in their honeymoon period, if you are coming out of your honeymoon it is not. One unknown at this time is how much is the illness you are describing affecting your BG and complicating your decision making.
Constant blood glucose in the 400 range is unacceptable, keep a very close eye, your fingers may hate you but you will thank yourself.  Don’t let yourself hangout in the 400 range for weeks or even days.  BG that high can lead to very bad things for someone whose honeymoon has ended.",Dec '18
522,New from Minnesota,Welcome,Welcome,LaddieType 1 or LADA,2,"For someone from Minneapolis I don’t see the Mayo Clinic ER being the appropriate place to seek care. It is out of network for many insurance plans in MN and is a 1-1/4 to 2 hour drive depending where you live in the Twin Cities. And I don’t think that one would necessarily receive better care there for diabetes than at some of the major hospitals in Minneapolis. Mayo is a great place for treating unusual diseases and getting obscure diagnoses and many people in Southeastern Minnesota get their routine care there. But for someone in my part of the state, I think Mayo would be an odd place to go and definitely not where one would want to establish care for a chronic condition like diabetes IMO. But you’re right that if Amy’s numbers stay above 400, an ER visit might be appropriate.",Dec '18

I don’t seem to have any kind of plateau or flat line, it just goes up and down in waves between 200-400.


Is this over a 24 hour period of time?  No flat line during sleep?  Are you getting enough sleep?
If you are going above 350 without the influence of food, you really need PROMPT medical attention.  Please do not wait until the doc can fit you in weeks down the calendar.
Do you have a PCP, primary care physician, that you can see promptly, before your appt. with your endo?
If not, I would strongly recommend that you seek care NOW from some source, an urgent care facility, or something similar.  You don’t want to cause irreversible damage while you wait for an endo to get you on a regimen that will control your blood sugar levels.
Seek care NOW and keep your lab and endo appts.  Delaying treatment is not in your best interest.
If you are bouncing between 200 and 400 in a roller coaster fashion, call your endo and demand that you be seen ASAP.  If they can’t fit you in, maybe it is time to look for another endo.

Going keto/lchf has helped me keep my blood glucose levels within range, with fasting levels in the 90’s and post prandial levels below 140.  Still, I seek to understand a little better how I arrived at this diagnosis and as time goes by, I’m understanding a little more, like how genetics plays a large role, etc.  I was slightly overweight, not obese, was moderately active, and followed a largely paleo type lifestyle prior to diagnosis.

563,A strange diagnosis,Welcome,Welcome,Dragon_J,1,"Hello,
I’m Dragan from Croatia. I had a strange diagnosis recently so I thought I should ask community about advice.
I’m 39, slim (70kg/184cm) but not very active, mostly sitting and working at my computer but doing cardio about 2 times a week (sometimes every day when i have time). I eat normally and I usually have very plentiful late dinners, right before bedtime (sometimes at 11-12 PM). When I exercise, I do it on empty stomach in the morning.
As I was checking my blood about once a year for the past few years, I’ve noticed that my blood sugar number is getting higher and higher each year.
My fasting blood glucose results from previous years are:
2014: 5.31 mmol/l
2015: 5.68 mmol/l
2016: 5.62 mmol/l
march 2017: 6.05  mmol/l (this is when they told me I should see an endocrinologist)
There is somewhat of a general upwards trend but I thought it’s not something to worry about too much.
But I went to see an endocrinologist in December 2017. He ordered some blood tests and here are the results (bloodwork done after fasting for 12 hours):
HbA1C: 5.4% (Normal: 4.0 - 6.2 %)
OGTT, 2 hours, 75g of glucose:
Time____________Glucose (mmol/l)_________________Insulin (μIU/ml)
0’___________________6.01 ___________________________ 5.39
30’_________________10.90 ___________________________47.97
60’_________________11.25 ___________________________87.95
90’__________________7.06 ___________________________46.27
120’_________________5.91 ___________________________24.41
Please let me know if I should convert these to other units. In Croatia, we use these units.
I’ve made the charts for easier reading (As a new member, I can only include one image per post so here’s glucose):
!

So, after seeing the results, my doctor ordered the anti GAD test which came out negative.
He told me that the results are not quite normal, but not diabetes either. That I’m right at the very edge (of prediabetes?).
He diagnosed me with something that would be “increased fasting glycemia” when I translate it to English as a layman.
he prescribed Glucophage (Metformin), told me to eat healthy, not to eat after 7pm and exercise more. I should get back to him with HbA1C and OGTT for control in one year.
Now, I didn’t start with metformin right away, I wanted to inform myself and read about the condition to see if something could be done without tablets. But I’m only getting more and more confused because I’m very slim and all the advice is mostly for people who can afford to lose weight. Does the doctor suggest that I’m on my way of becoming a Type2? Do my OGTT insulin measurments and a negative anti-GAD definitely suggest that I’m not developing Type1?
Please share your thoughts. Should I buy a glucose meter and measure my levels throughout the day. If so, do you know of a guide as to when should I take measurements and how to interpret them? That is, what should my goal be?
Thank you very much for reading and helping out!",Mar '18

@Terry4  Thank you for the link, that was very informative. I’ve looked at the tests available at my local lab and they only have (ICA) and (IAA). I’ll look for others elsewhere.
@kmichel  My typical diet is already not very high on carbohydrates. I mostly eat meat, fish and vegetables. I never liked sweets and candies even as a kid. I don’t like bread and rice. I like potato and pasta though. I also don’t eat fruit much. Basically, I have a strong dislike for anything that tastes sweet, I can’t even use ketchup bought at a supermarket because I find it too sweet. I just get pressed tomatoes and make my own ketchup. Is this sweetness-aversion a sign that my body can’t process sugar as well as it should? But it’s been like that for as long as I remember. By the way, the doctor has also tested my cholesterol levels which are ok.
I understand this could be prediabetes but what’s confusing me is that my diet isn’t rich in sugars and carbohydrates and that I’m underweight. I immediately looked at alternatives to metformin after diagnosis but I’ve mostly found the lose-weight advice. Some people also told me that metformin will make me lose weight and I’m already too thin and always have been. This led me to believe I might be misdiagnosed.
@Dmitry2 Thank you for the advice. I’ll definitely do that. After I make those measurements, I should aim for keeping my glucose levels below 10mmol/l (180 mg/ml)?
Also, one more thing, I’ve noticed in the last few years that I urinate more often but only at night. I have to get up to urinate at least two times during the night. So maybe I should also test glucose at those night times? It’s strange because I’ve listened to my doctors advice and don’t eat after 7PM anymore and I still have those urges during the night.
If there’s someone who had similar issues and test results, please share what you’ve learned.
I was hoping that someone here could tell if this looks more like Type 1 by looking at my insulin OGTT levels. As far as I understand, in Type1, I should have a lack of insulin and it doesn’t seem to be so. I couldn’t find a resource for interpreting my insulin OGTT curve that I could understand.
Thank you all again. I know that this is not a big deal comparing to real diabetes but it might be the beginning, and it’s all new to me ",Mar '18
568,A strange diagnosis,Welcome,Welcome,katers87,,"There are people on a couple of forums I frequent that have been diagnosed with T1 diabetes, but their bodies currently still produce some insulin- just not enough.
You may have read online that people diagnosed with T1 diabetes may have lost weight recently and be quite thin upon diagnosis. This weight-loss can be attributed to persistently high blood sugars and lack of insulin resulting in the body not processing food properly. People with sudden onset T1 diabetes may have fasting blood sugar levels well above 500 mg/dl (~28 mmol/l) when they’re diagnosed. My blood sugar was in the 800s, but I hadn’t yet begun to lose weight because my parents caught my diabetes so quickly.
Other T1s may lose their insulin-producing cells more slowly though. I would not consider your weight to be the determining factor when considering which form of diabetes you have unless your fasting blood sugar level is over 140 mg/dl (7.77 mmol/l).
The primary factors (though not sole factors) that determine if someone has T1 or T2 diabetes are:

Do they have antibodies that indicate their immune system attacked the beta cells in their pancreas (Type 1)?
Is their body using insulin properly? Do they have insulin resistance (Type 2)?

I’m looking for studies that state what the normal insulin levels (μIU/ml) should be following an OGTT. High levels of insulin would indicate insulin resistance (pre T2 diabetes perhaps). I’m not familiar enough with the test to say. From what I’ve seen so far, 5.39 μIU/ml fasting is normal. However, 24.41 appears high at the 2 hour mark. I’m still looking though. I accidentally posted this early.",Mar '18

Which by their study, means that I have a greater chance of developing Type2 than Patterns 1 and 2 but lesser than 4 and 5.
I’ve also found some insulin graphs in pmol/L units but when I use online converters to convert from μIU/ml, I get some insane values so I guess there’s something wrong with the unit conversion.",Mar '18
570,A strange diagnosis,Welcome,Welcome,katers87,3,"Your pattern looks similar to pattern 3, but your levels are a bit lower, so it’s difficult to tell if your levels are normal or not? The pattern may be perfectly normal at lower levels. I’m not sure.
I’ll look a little more today to see if I can find something more definitive.
Here’s a study that shows the glucose profiles of people without diabetes: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769652/ 7

I think it’d be worth testing your blood sugar a few times a day to see if your profile fits within the normal range. You could also test at night when you get up to urinate. Some people just need to urinate more often, so you may or may not have higher blood sugar levels when you get up.
It’s clear that you’re concerned about the results and want to be healthy. Given that, I think it might be worth compiling some data to see if you’re staying in the desired range.
Exercising can help tremendously with insulin sensitivity. My doctor says that I don’t have insulin resistance, but I still noticed that I’m more sensitive to insulin when I’m exercising regularly- especially more sensitive at meal times. It might be worth adding daily exercise (or every other day) to your schedule.",Mar '18
571,A strange diagnosis,Welcome,Welcome,Firenza,2,"An A1C of 5.4 approximates an average blood sugar so your blood sugar could be going quite high after meals. While some diabetics feel that 180 as their upper range is okay if my blood sugar is 180 I feel thirsty and if it goes any higher I start feeling tired and moody. If you are becoming a diabetic then the best thing you can do for your long term health is keep your blood sugars as close to normal as possible (80 to 120 or so). It is known that blood sugars that are above 140 for an extended period of time are damaging.
Your low weight could be caused by high blood sugars so if you can get your post meal spikes under control you might start gaining weight. I would start taking the metformin if diet and exercise won’t get your blood sugars to a non-diabetic range and see if it helps.
Also, it is a big deal no matter what point you are at in this disease. Being worried and not knowing what to do is normal with this condition because there is so little public legitimate knowledge on diabetes.

In terms of units, the units you will most often see used on this site are:

The conversion factor of these is 18.
There are lots of websites and charts all over to help you convert.  Here is one that has a nice visual:

In general, it is considered that healthy people would have their glucose level in the range of 75-120 all the time with below 100 at fasting and this is the target of some of us. I have seen very few imperical data from healthy people and it is hard to say if this is exactly how it is, may be occasional larger spikes are a part of a norm too.

I would respectfully disagree unless the statement was not including post meal BG - which perhaps I misread the intent of the post.
I am a parent of a T1 and am non-D myself.  I can easily spike to 180 with particularly chosen foods and speed of eating.  A handful of Swedish Fish consumed in five minutes is only one easy example.

So it seems everyone agrees that it’s OK that I think I shouldn’t just start taking metformin right away but first gather some data and try with diet and exercise first.

Your Dr. sounds more enlightened than many we have to endure here in the US.  He was smart to check for antibodies.  The results suggest you’re probably not T1, and likely headed in the direction of T2.  There’s a common misperception that you have to be overweight to have T2.  T2 is the result of insulin resistance, which can happen to any body type.  In fact, the latest research suggests that this insulin resistance is what causes weight gain, not the other way around.  Further, I don’t like the term pre-diabetes very much at all.  It’s like saying you’re half-pregnant.  You either have the ability to normalize your blood sugar or you don’t.  In your case, it looks like it’s impaired.  I would recommend considering a Freestyle Libre to map out exactly what’s happening with your glucose levels.  Regardless, Glucophage is one of the safest and most proven first-line diabetes drugs to specifically address insulin resistance.  In fact, they’ve discovered secondary benefits that help reduce the chances of certain types of cancer.  Some complain about GI issues as a side effect.  The extended release version will usually address that.  Your diet and lifestyle sound pretty healthy.  Your Dr.'s advice seems pretty sound.  Keep doing what you’re doing and keep a regular eye on your glucose trends.  You’ve identified it early and have an excellent chance of keeping it under excellent control.

581,Just diagnosed a month or so ago,Welcome,Welcome,Jenn20,1,"I didn’t realize that there was a “welcome” section. I first typed in the pinned thread. So here goes.
Hello, my name is Jenn. I was diagnosed as a 40 something with type 1.5 in May 2018. High blood sugars were caught in a blood work done for an upcoming surgery. It was over 400. I didn’t really notice any symptoms beyond my eyes going to hell. And as to my eyes, I was still using steroids on them as I had iritis so I thought it was after effects from that. I live in the desert and have always drank a lot of water, same with going to the bathroom. I also have crohn’s (dx 20 years ago) and thought it was a flare as my crohn’s symptoms were acting up too. Not to mention, the surgery was for hidradenitis surpurtiva(HS).
I had high blood sugars in December, but again, thought it was a crohn’s flare. It was in the high 300’s but I didn’t think anything of it as I thought it was just because I had a coke right before testing. My eyes were bad then, but I thought it was just because of flaring. I didn’t even think about diabetes, never crossed my mind.
Not only do I have crohn’s, but have autoimmune liver disease (PSC) and Ankylosing spondolytis in addition to the aforementioned HS and in January was also dx’d with IgA vasculitis. So have a lot of autoimmune stuff going on.
To say this diagnosis took me totally by surprise is an understatement. I felt like an utter failure as a person due to stigmas surrounding diabetes. I mean, I had been losing weight, was getting fit and active, and my crohn’s and arthritis was getting a lot better (I had been housebound for years previously). It didn’t seem right that now I was feeling so much better that this would happen. It seemed like a cruel joke.
So now I’m on insulin (Lantus/Humalog) and trying to make sense of it all. It can be frustrating as the foods good for my crohn’s tummy is NOT good for my diabetes. I’m trying to learn the balancing act between all my issues. I’m trying to stay positive, but some days it gets real hard.",Jul '18

586,Hi New Here!,Welcome,Welcome,jean63,,"Just wanted to stop in and say hi. I am new to Tudiabetes. I’ve had pre diabetes for about 18 years. I worked in health care and the first A1c I ever did on myself in my early 40’s was 6.0. I have managed to stay in the low 6’s, below the 6.5 “cut off” through diet. Strangely enough, I noticed that the antidepressants I took helped lower my blood sugars!  Also, I have to take plaquenil for RA and that also lowers my BS and can sometimes give me a low.
Recently however, when I stopped my antidepressant and had a bad stomach virus, my A1c went up to 7. Ouch! They tried me on Metformin and Januvia and they both gave me horrible muscle aches and stiffness. This was so disappointing!  I don’t know where things will go from here. I am hoping I can at least keep my A1c around 6.5 so I don’t have to go on meds.  A lot of meds don’t agree with me.",Jul '18

589,Hi New Here!,Welcome,Welcome,Firenza,1,"If your A1C doesn’t come back down then I would ask for insulin because of the side effects you got from type 2 meds. BTW insulin is not quite the dangerous substance it used to be in the pre- 2000’s because most of the newer insulins are much easier to use. I use Afrezza and Tresiba and I hardly ever go low and I haven’t gone low enough to need any help since I started using them.
It’s interesting that your A1C jumped after your illness (you’ll find that a lot of type 1’s got diabetes after an illness), to me it almost sounds like you may be developing LADA rather than type 2. Have you had any antibody testing done?",Jul '18

I had GD in 2009 requiring insulin, normalized post pregnancy and then retested 2016 and was diagnosed as diabetic based on elevated fasting and failed ogtt twice. This coincides with my home testing which shows dawn phenomenon and elevated post meal glucose if I eat more than 30 carbs a sitting.  However, my a1c has remained normal (initially 4.9, latest 5.4) so I’m still on no treatment. My cpeptide is low normal and my anti-Gad is highly positive. I range between blissfully ignoring my diagnosis to obsessively scouring the internet.  I have many relatives with type 2 and have seen the toll of poorly controlled diabetes that I hope to avoid.  I’m thin, fit, have eaten lowish carb since 2009 so for now I suspect there isn’t much else to do.  I wonder how long I may be able to stay in this stage.

You could give some consideration to limited, selective use of insulin for higher carb meals. Some studies suggest that the use of exogenous insulin allows your beta cells to “rest” and therefore extends their life.

Hello twin, it’s nice to meet you! I do take Metformin (helps with the Dawn Phenomenon), but otherwise I’m hanging out in the “LADA but no insulin therapy” category. For me, that’s been a couple of years since diagnosis, with few changes. My A1cs have been between 4.6 and 5.2, but I do have some issues with mildly elevated fasting BGs, and I can’t eat many carbs before I have a significant post-meal spike.
So, I’m just monitoring and staying healthy until something changes. As for the year 9 of LADA, it’s not as unusual as you might think! I started going back and reading the scientific literature (I’m a research scientist), and it turns out the oldest descriptions of LADA were as a slow-onset Type 1 in adults that could take two to fifteen years before insulin-dependence. Most people seem to definitely be on the earlier side of that particular spectrum, but we have a few here that have been antibody-positive for a few years, have impaired glucose response (of some variety), and are still not insulin-dependent. It’s a bit like living in a twilight world, but it is what it is.

622,Newbie here,Welcome,Welcome,ademarco,1,"Hello…I am sort of new to the whole diabetes thing.  I am 44 years old.  Was dx when I was 28 with Gestational Diabetes…fine for 15 years and wham out of nowhere I became sick with a cold, but not just the common cold.  This cold knocked me out.  Missed two days of work b/c of it.  Laid on the couch for two days straight and couldn’t move.  That was back in December of 2017. Felt horrible for a few weeks.  No energy at all, fatigued like I have NEVER been before. Started to feel a little better by Christmas and then Whammmm, again it hit me on NYE 2018.  Out for the count again for a few days.  Decided to go out to dinner with my son and while driving home on a road that I travel daily, I became disoriented and had no clue where I was.  My son said I was slurring my words and not making any sense.  Nothing was making sense to me.  Luckily I was just around the corner from home.  I got us home safely (which in retrospect, I probably should have pulled the car over).  I laid awake the entire night trying to figure out what was wrong with me.  I was fearful that I was having a stroke or something and then it dawned on me; my blood sugar (thankful for having gestational for giving me enough knowledge) I got out my not so trusty glucometer and tested.  I was a whopping 525.  “That cannot be,” I thought, "" ah, it’s an old meter, I will check in the morning"".  Went to bed and tested my fasting and it was 480.  Went online and started my research…  15 years ago all diabetes paraphernalia was by a doctors prescription only, so I was elated to find out that you could purchase all the supplies that you needed.  I went to our local Walmart and purchased everything I needed to test.  Went home and tested…418.  Ughhhh.  Feeling horrible I drug myself to work that Monday, called my doctor and make an appointment, I asked to have a script for blood work ready so that I would have the results by next weeks appointment…and there it was A1C was 8.9.
I am a very petite woman at only 5’ tall and at the that time 103 pounds.  I ate healthy worked out often and did yoga 5 times a week.  How could this be?  Diabetes knows no prejudice…I was initially diagnosed as a Type 2 diabetic., put on Metformin and Glimiperide (sp).  I was on this for about 2.5 months and then I wound up in the hospital with Pancreatitis and an enlarged gallbladder.  Saw a specialist in the hospital where he suspected I was not type 2 and told me to follow up with an Endocrinologist.  I saw one the week that I got out of the hospital, he sent me out for a Type 1 antibody test, where I tested positive.  I am now on Tresiba and Glimperide and gaining weight like crazy.  My numbers are sort of crazy right now.  I feel a ton better, but I am not happy about the weight gain.  Being only 5’ tall and gaining weight is not a goal of mine for sure.  I am happy that I am feeling a lot better, but what a roller coaster  it’s been.",May '18

The issue is that the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), has given preliminary advice that those of us who use immuno suppressants should wait until time for our immuno suppressant  have the vaccine, then wait for one full period before we have the immuno suppressant.
I take Rituxan twice each 4 months.  Meaning I would have the second dose of Rituxan then wait 4 months, have the vaccine, then wait 4 months.
So wait about eight months to have the Rituxan.  It is a terrible choice.  Go back to barley walking and being awake or get the vaccine.  Since i would also have to be off Methotrexate for one month the outcome could be awful.
ACR has yet to release final advice to rheumatologists so hopefully Rituxan might be treated differently in the final advice, but right now, as much I want it, if what preliminary advice is correct and i do not wait.  The vaccine will be wasted.  The patient (me of course) will be fine, it is the vaccine that will be wasted.

I looked through Pfizer’s article, and while they don’t say if the people with diabetes in the trial had type 1 or 2, there were 118 people in the trial (62 received the real vaccine) with rheumatic diseases- most of which are autoimmune diseases. There were 100 people with diabetes that had complications and 1,473 people with diabetes without complications that received the real vaccine. These counts are in the supplementary appendix in the link below.
62 is a small number. Still, seeing the large number of people with diabetes and seeing that some trial participants had autoimmune diseases gave me some comfort that the trials had included people with a similar background to me, if not the same background.

Honestly though, I’m just ready to resume some semblance of normal life. I want to be able to hug my friends, go out to restaurants, travel. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to get a vaccination any time soon because I don’t meet the criteria for the early phases.

My family has been deeply affected by the Thimerosal preservative briefly used in vaccines.
Yes, it’s a hottly debated topic and the pharmaceutical companies and government swear up and down that it didn’t cause autism or other problems… But surprise, surprise there much evidence to the contrary.  It’s easy to sure evidence to match your claims. This is very personal to us…  We have 3 severe cases, and 1 mild in the family.  All from different bloodlines, different locations, but only in the same generation that received Thimerosal, and nowhere else.  There have been other mistakes in medical history, too.  We don’t know the problem exist until they’ve had time to come to light.
I simply cannot submit to anything like this until I see how it plays out amongst the other guinea pigs.  Because I’m my eyes, that’s what everyone jumping on the vaccine is.  You’re still test subjects.

Nope. I just feel my bladder is full and need to pee. I do feel lower back pain but the pain has been there for 2-3 weeks now, and the frequent urination only happened yesterday night.
I might just mention in case anyone has this problem and know how to fix it -  everyday when i wake up, my lower back is really sore.  I go to bed okay.  It’s just when I wake up.  Once I get up and start moving, the pain is gone, but the first thing I notice when I am awake is my lower back is in a lot of pain - it feels like its muscle pain more than mechanical (ie doesn’t feel like a joint is out of place).  I try to stretch it out at night before bed, sometimes it helps and sometimes doesn’t.  My core strength isn’t the best (and probably this is what is causing it) and I have tried some strengthening exercises too.
This pain comes and goes, but when it’s here it lingers for a while.  Sometimes I have it for a month or so and then it dissapears but eventually it will come back.  I’ve been battling this for a while but haven’t been able to find the cause of it.   I was worried it was my kidneys and got a urine test done and my GP says its fine and he says the place where is is sore is not where the kidney is.  I also noticed the intensity is more when i wake up sleeping on my back compared to if i was sleeping on my side.



 MM1:

Have you considered a UTI?


I don’t have any of the symptoms listed.  When i have UTI, i feel I need to pee but can’t and that feeling makes me feel really bad.   But this is different, its just like my bladder is full and I need to go like normally.  It doesn’t burn or feel weird.  I just feel a bit tired after like the 5th time.  It doesn’t lasts.  Might happen for 1-5 nights usually less and then disappears maybe like once every two months.

Frequent urination is a symptom of high blood sugar because your kidneys try to regulate it by flushing your system. Also why high blood sugars make a person thirsty. What levels are your blood sugars overnight? If they are 180ish or higher, then that could be the cause. If they are much lower than that though, shouldn’t be related to T1D (unless you are on one of the SGLT-2 inhibitor meds that lowers that threshold, but still would be around 140-150).
Are you taking any other meds that could increase urination? Anything that’s a diuretic?",21h

Have you thought any more about using loop? I think it would be a big benefit to you, even if you only enabled it over night. You used it before, can you just restart it?
My take is that people get disappointed in various looping tech when they expect too much out of it. What looping is really, really good at is overnight management, during overnight fasting. That should work well out of the box.
It is much more complicated for looping to get meal management dialed in, because of delays in insulin and digestion, and sudden changes in eating, exercise, etc. while awake. So start off with the expectation that looping is mostly for overnight sanity, and add in meal management during waking hours only as experience allows.

Also, eat and take your last food bolus at least a few hours before bed so it will have less impact overnight.
Basal rate is dialed into your pump already, and correction ratio is something I can rely on, unless I am still digesting and throwing more food into the blood.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been doubling every 20 years. In Finland, the recommendation for daily vitamin D supplementation was gradually reduced from 4000-5000 IU in 1964 to 400 IU in 1992. Concomitantly, T1D increased by 350% in those aged 1-4 years, 100% in those aged 5-9 years, and 50% in those aged 10-14 years [1]. However, since 2006, T1D has plateaued and decreased after an increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) after the authorities’ decision to fortify all dietary milk products with cholecalciferol [2]. Moreover, the worldwide association of ultraviolet (UV)-B light and vitamin D status with T1D and multiple sclerosis is now more than evident.

It is well known that viruses can play a role in type 1 and other autoimmune diseases. EBV  is linked to multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes & celiac as well as several cancers, mostly lymphomas.

As an idea, the flu relationship could be the other way around, in that a weakened immune state of impending T1 you are more likely to get the flu, or succumb to other mental or physical problems, or the the flu can be the proverbial ‘last straw’, not causing, but accelerating beta-cell decline.

Imagine this: your immune system has been killing off your beta cells for the past years but you’ve been barely getting along with the reduced insulin production.
Then all of a sudden you get the flu and you now need twice as much insulin. And your pancreas cannot keep up at all. Whatever beta cells are left are pushed to their limit and beyond. Shortly afterwards (weeks) you in DKA and the doc in the ER puts you on insulin.
My theory is not that the flu caused an immune reaction that killed your beta cells and caused diabetes. My theory is that your body had been killing off beta cells for the past year, it’s just the flu brought it to the surface where it was easily diagnosed as DKA following the flu.",Dec '20

Medical professionals like doctors and CDEs can help but the reality of living with diabetes is that they are not available to you 24/7.

Doctors can help with less time sensitive info but they’re rarely available at 2:00 a.m. in the middle of a three day holiday weekend when metabolic crises inevitably happen.
Doctors are indispensable for longer-term health decisions but they can’t be there every time you need moment-to-moment advice; that’s your job!
I’m using a do-it-yourself open-source automated insulin dosing system now (pump, CGM, app running on iPhone), but before that I also dosed insulin using an insulin to carb ratio to calculate an immediate bolus. Since I eat a low carb, high-fat diet, I also used my pump to deliver an extended bolus for 50% of protein grams and 10% of fat grams counted as “equivalent carbs.”

The honeymoon phase is challenging, since you won’t know how much insulin your pancreas is contributing.
However, since you use Dexcom, I think you could easily respond to that and dose as needed.  92 average now says you’re doing great.  Your cgm readings/trends will be your guide.
Check out the book Sugar Surfing for using cgm data/trends to guide your food choices/quantity, and insulin dosing.

I think calibrations should be avoided.

The first day of a new sensor don’t calibrate at all
Don’t calibrate unless the dexcom is consistently off by the same amount in the same direction.
If the dexcom is on average off by 10 or less its not worth calibration

Example Dexcom is reading around 20 high all the time compared to meter.
Because the Dexcom is using an algorithm and projecting your blood sugar when you have fast rises and fast falls its more likely to be off. When your sugar is level its more likely to be accurate.
Extra calibrations actually lead to getting worse results from the dexcom.
If your dexcom is off by more then 50 points more than a few times I would request a new sensor.

I cannot verify this but it is what I was told today. This is hard for me to believe but apparently if I am scripted for Kwickpens then the insurer automatically puts the copay under my part D and there’s no confusion with part B.
In the past we all wanted insulin under part B because it was less copay than under D but not with the $35 a month plan it is just the reverse. I can use any insulins by any route. I couldn’t care less about staying with a pump. I just need the insulin. I know how to best use all of them and various combinations. Anything is better than the OTC R or N by Relion brand sold cheaply at WulMurt. That’s a familiar fall-back plan out of desperation for pumpers who run out of Novolog or Humalog in 10mL vials regardless of the concentrations. For that matter, i can get Kwickpen insulin into a pump if necessary and adjust for the concentration if the Kwickpens are U-200 by using half the dose volume to equate to the U-100 even though we are told not to do this.
Long story short, Kwickpens may (or most likely if not definitely) come under the $35 plan now but vial may not for prior pumpers.
More confusing, apparently insulin lispro (humalog) is covered as U-100 but not U-200, they told me (although I cannot verify) under a part D $35 copay but for Lyumjev the $35 monthly cost applies to any amount of either U-100 or U-200 per month. Makes no sense to me why that is so but let’s presume it is since I was told so by Optim-Rx which is the mail order arm used by United (and maybe others).
As an additional aside, Lyumjev comes in U-100 and U-200. But I am not familiar with it. I never used it. I presume it is new or newer.
The bottom line remains paying as little as possible for insulin(s) by high-dose T1 people like me.",1d

By lifting the adhesive carefully at the narrow end of the G6 transmitter, and lifting the adhesive pad on both sides, and finally at the wider end, holding a finger on the transmitter to keep it from lifting yet, the transmitter holder can then be lifted at the sides and pulled a little above a parallel to the skin surface and then moved away from the insertion point. The sensor wire has never broken for me in more than 4 years. Just be sure to pull the wire straight out of the tiny hole, rather than bend it around a corner.

Much like every other post I’ve read about LADA, there was quite a bit of confusion about my diagnosis over a span of 5-6 years. Lucky for me my Endo isn’t narrow minded and heavily relied on my input/what was best for me .
Diagnosed as T2 originally five years ago, but as soon as C-peptide and antibody tests came back that quickly switched to T1 (0.5 ng/ml; positive for GAD65 only ). Started MDI, but once I got my basal figured out I was finding I rarely needed to bolus. So I was being well controlled on 10-12 units of Lantus daily . Over the next 6 months I had to keep lowering basal doses due to hypos til eventually had to come off insulin all together . Naturally the “I’m cured” thoughts creep in although you know deep down that isn’t true . This is where I have been over the last 6 years until blood sugars started creeping back up lately which really got my research juices flowing and became convinced  that my case is LADA.  Doc tried pushing various orals , but I respectfully declined and asked to be put back on MDI which has now made things immensely easier to control . C-peptide is still hovering between 0.3-0.5 so it’s still a toss up when the failing pancreas decides it wants to work, but there is an odd sense of relief that with it losing steam things are more predictable.
Crazy the many masks this illness wears and how everyone’s experience can vary drastically, but reading this forum has been such a huge crutch/resource for me when I was trying to get this thing figured out . Until looking deeper into it I never would
have guessed a 6 year honeymoon to be a possibility. Kudos and respect  to all the true Type 1s out there that were completely insulin dependent from the get go . In a way I feel like I got a victory lap and some time to really figure this thing out .",3d

Craig, I’m on day 3 with Apidra and I think I’m seeing some trends similar to what you and sri describe - a faster peak and shorter duration, but I haven’t crunched the numbers yet so I can’t really be sure. If so, that works great for use in a pump (not necessarily for MDIs though!).
sri, you make are really interesting point about immunity - I will have to pay close attention to the first couple days after the switch. Maybe it would be better to do two weeks on each one instead of one…

Apidra falls somewhere in between; it was not as fast as Humalog, but much faster than Novolog.

I just got some Apidra samples and used them for two meals today. I’d been seeing some highs with Novolog recently–I opened a new pen and was still seeing highs, but possibly my pens were getting old since I bought them in October.
Whatever the case, the first two trials the Apidra worked extremely quickly and it gave me even better numbers than Novolog has been. I didn’t go high at all and was back to baseline by 2 hours and dropped a bit more in the third hour. Nothing after that. Also my blood sugar started to drop at 15 minutes and I think that the claim you could inject after eating might hold up.
The only downside is the Opticlick pen. My mate took one look at it and asked me if it was an extra large vibrator. I don’t think it will fit comfortably in my purse, either. Your point in an old blog entry about what happens if you lose the pen is a real concern, ditto what happens if you want to check that the cartridge hadn’t gone bad by using a new one.
I read that they will be using the Solostar disposable pen for Apidra, eventually, and I’ve been using one of those (also a sample) with Lantus. It seems pretty much identical to the Novolog pen. No half units, but otherwise fine.",Apr '08

Secondary to the ethical questions this raises (in that they are not in compliance with federal agreements on vaccine delivery protocols), we wonder this:
Should there be any concern in early vaccination if CDC hasn’t yet been released recommendations for high risk chronic illness grounds? One of the guys is HIV+ (early diagnosis in the 80s).

Then vaccination priorities are announced. And every fine distinction we make about our own disease, seems to be swept under the rug along with all the fine distinctions about hundreds of other chronic conditions.
There is a lot of interpretation left to - who knows? local health officials? - about the fine details of vaccination priority groups. I’m T1, I’m over 50, I’m an essential worker (I even have a letter in the glovebox since March, from the police chief, saying I’m a “critical infrastructure worker” and I’m allowed to drive whenever I want), but I’d be surprised if I get vaccinated before June.",6d

That’s kinda what I’m trying to sort out.
I can’t really see the forest thru the trees anymore, so I wanna be cautious.
They are specifically waiting to vacc HIV because they a concerned that the vacc could hurt them in some way. They state it very explicitly.
Medical risks are sooo dependent of the individual. Everybody is different.
Vaccine priorities are still very much in flux among illness groups.
We do NOT know that T1’s will have any priority. T2’s will.
QUESTIONS
1.) Are they unprepared to vacc T1’s because they think we are more medically vulnerable? We are in the same vacc boat as HIV - both are in the category of not having a large enough data sample to proceed with early vacc. They have issued strong warnings about HIV & vacc, but not for us. That leads me to believe that for some individuals, they perceive risk.
2.) I assume that there is a reason that these vacc protocols have been established.
The agreements between the State and the Feds are to follow the CDC guidelines for delivery. They are currently supposed to be doing healthcare providers, not EVERY hospital employee that is working remote. That appears to me to be a violation of medical ethics. If we can’t trust the hospital to follow some standard of medical ethics in this very serious situation where everyone is watching, WTF?!?!? Why should we anticipate that anyone will follow protocol?
Does the non-adherence to protocol put people at undue risk? The hospital wants people back in the office. That’s their only justification for doing this. Are they putting my friend at risk by pushing him to the front of the line for vacc before CDC has issued hard and fast guidelines? It feels safer to vacc with your illness group, once risks are better established.

At the most most macro public health level, it doesn’t matter a lot which group you vaccinate first. You won’t stop the virus until 80-90% of everyone is vaccinated.
Figuring out the best order to vaccinate does have some possibility to vaccinate the highest risk/highest danger/smallest communities first.

At the macro level, delaying your own vaccination for whatever angels-dancing-on-a-head-of-a-pin that may be real or you might be imagining, it only slows us down in stopping the spread of the virus.
If say 20% of the population is worried about some chronic health condition they have and the lack of testing of that particular vaccine against that particular condition or treatment, and doesn’t get vaccinated, then we may never reach the 90% vaccination level needed for stopping spread of the virus at the macro-public-health level.",6d

As a result of the 40g you have eaten just 20g are absorbed (just a guess). So your expectation that it just prolongs the absorbtion is not correct. Of course to compensate for the lower amount of carbs in your blood stream you need to lower your bolus!

The standard test to differentiate between Type 1 and Type 2 is the (proper) glucose tolerance. The test must measure both sugar and insulin level. If the insulin level is 0, obviously Type 1. If sugar level and insulin level both rise sharply, then Type 2. For someone first put on insulin and then given a glucose tolerance test, the insulin level will be a straight line for Type 1 and will go up for Type 2 (but the glucose tolerance test should have been done before insulin was prescribed). If one suspects a false diagnosis of Type 1 and prescribed insulin, the proper test is creatinine, which is a byproduct of insulin production and will be 0 for a Type 1 even if taking insulin, and normal for anyone who is not Type 1.
Some doctors (we had one in my home town) order a faux glucose tolerance test for those who come in with fasting sugars of 70 mg/dl = 4 mmol/l. A large quantity of glucose is given, and if sugar goes up, Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed; if sugar does not go up, hypoglycaemia is diagnosed, so all those tested need extensive and expensive medical care.
A normal physician, if one has a fasting blood sugar less than 126 mg/dl = 7 mmol/l, says one does not have diabetes and lets it go at that. A very few persons do have normal fasting sugars but postprandial sugars above 200 mg/dl = 11 mmol/l and are technically diabetic, but this is very rare, and physicians not trying to maximise revenue  do not do the faux glucose tolerance test that does not measure insulin levels.
(It is also not clear what it means if someone has sugars that rise to 200/11 after a meal then quickly drop below 126/7, or if this really requires treatment; strictly speaking, blood glucose is now an obsolete test for diabetes–though still commonly used–HbA1c should be used as the definitive test for diabetes.)",9d

@MichaelW, in fact autoantibody tests are inexpensive ($55 or $10 via JDRF T1Detect), readily available (JDRF, Mayo Clinic Lab, etc.) and quite reliable (laboratory standardization was done in ~2010). Diabetes researcher R. David Leslie MD says, “The best way to identify autoimmune diabetes is to assess diabetes-associated autoantibodies [GAD, IAA, IA-2, ZnT8], which represent the only relevant categorical trait.”  An American Diabetes Association position statement affirms, “Consider measurement of pancreatic autoantibodies to confirm the diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes.""

What sort of an “answer” are you hoping to get? It’s hard to know how much detail to provide you without knowing more about how you intend to use your G6.
Will you be using G6 with an insulin pump (e.g. Tandem)? Will you be using the Dexcom receiver to interact with your G6 sensor? Or will you be using the Dexcom phone app to set up your G6?
Note: If you are going to use your phone, you should verify that the app will work on your phone by checking on the Dexcom compatibly web site 1.
Another Note: Even though you don’t need to, I would recommend entering the G6 sensor code to avoid requiring calibration. You can still calibrate it, but you’ll be able to do it on your own timeline. If you don’t enter the calibration code for a sensor then I believe you’ll be required to calibrate on the sensor’s schedule.

Those aren’t my rules, though.  I don’t care much about accuracy with higher numbers, but I want them spot on under 100.  If Dexcom says I’m under 70, but I feel good and the fingerstick says I’m in range… I’m gonna calibrate.  Don’t screw with my data and don’t turn off my insulin!


Make sure you’re using an accurate meter, not a random number generator.


Only calibrate when you’re in range, because that’s when the fingerstick is most accurate.  The margin of errors turn into bigger differences the higher your blood sugar is.


Only calibrate when your trend is flat, and not if you’ve bolused or ate recently and expect the trend line to change.  Glucose concentration changes more rapidly in the blood than the interstitial fluid that Dex measures, leaving a disparity between the two when your BG is changing.


Also make sure you’re drinking your water.  If you’re dehydrated, glucose can’t circulate through the interstitial fluid causing the data to be way off.  Not a good time to calibrate.

Each G6 sensor will have a 4-digit code.  When you insert/start new sensor, you will be prompted for code.  This allows the sensor to not prompt for calibrations, and as some mentioned, results in accurate readings.  But you can still enter calibration if needed, such as when a BG reading is far off and cgm trend is flat.
If you don’t enter the 4-digit code at start, you will be prompted to enter a calibration every 12 hours, which you can do, or ignore it.
If code is not entered, you will likely get less accurate readings at first, since the logic in dexcom uses that code specific to that batch of sensors.
But manual calibration after code can improve readings if they get off track.",9d

I think there is some confusion over what generation of Medtronic CGM sensors are being used. I haven’t been following this closely, but I think the next model of Medtronic’s CGM sensors will not require initial calibration. But it’s not available yet so currently available Medtronic pumps will still use the Guardian 3 sensor/transmitter combo.
I assume the pump will be able to use the next model of sensors when Medtronic releases them or, at worst, an update to the pump’s firmware will need to be downloaded to enable that.

Just remember that you’ve got to take everything you hear from a company representative with a grain of salt.  They’re not going to tell you good things about the competition   i can tell you from experience that this is not true at all of Tandem’s Control-IQ.  I just generally guesstimate insulin and it’s great at smoothing out the rest. I seldom bolus for small snacks and I sometimes forget to bolus for a meal at all until my “did you bolus??” alarm goes off at 140.
Today was one of those nights…  It’s not a model graph to be proud of, but if is a good real world example.  I had a bowl of split pea soup, 2 buttered thick slices of homemade bread for dipping, and a cup of hot chocolate with mini marshmallows for dessert.  I’m no low-carber.
Anddd totally forgot to bolus until the alarm went off at 140.  I was already on a normally unstoppable accent at that point.  But Control-IQ adjusted my basal and added extra insulin in the background.  Not enough to fully cover my meal.  I still had to bolus.  But it gave enough to avoid disaster.  I topped out at 188.  While it’s higher than my personal upper range of 160, it’s only barely outside the ADA guideline of 180, and only for 3 readings.  Had I remembered to pre-bolus, or bolus at all really, I probably would have never crossed 140.

I don’t have experience with the 670g, so I can’t speak on that specifically…
But I think the biggest problem with switching to  automated insulin dosing is that it exacerbates any problems in your pump settings.  It’s always been a struggle to find a balance of numbers that “work” for someone.  Many people fight and fight and never do actually find a working combo.  One setting that would deliver too much insulin can be offset by another setting that would under-deliver, and you might THINK you’re dialed in…  You don’t realize how far off your settings actually are until they’re being implemented minute by minute to make adjustments.  It highlights every weakness.
That’s why you see such a strong division of love it or hate it amongst Control-IQ users.  The system works phenomenally with the right settings, and I can’t wait to see how much it gets better with the looming software update that is supposed to improve customization options.  Unfortunately, not everyone has the knowledge or the support to get their settings dialed in.  Those poor souls are still on the frustrating rollercoaster that bad settings yield.
While I’m no fan of Medtronic and I know there were other problems with the system, I highly suspect that a lot of their furious 670g patient base was also because of this incorrect settings problem.  The pumps can only work within the parameters you set.  Being the first on the market, I think it was such a disgruntling change that many gave in to the frustrations before finding a way to make it work for them.  I think it was a cost they paid for being first to market.  I think they greased a few wheels for Tandem to come in and rescue the weary.
That said… I think it’s a given that the 770 and 780 pumps will bring a better user experience.  They HAVE to.  Metronic has been very forthcoming about the 670g not being “well received”, and all of their conference presentations I’ve seen have focused on the improved patient experience.  In terms of glycemic control improvements, they were pretty much on par with Tandem’s 2019 Control-IQ trials.  I think I’ve gotta give Tandem the edge there, though, because Tandem’s next gen software, due early this year, should offer further improvements yet, leaving Medtronic a few years behind.
But clinical trials aren’t the big picture.  I’m very curious to see how the 770/780 plays out in the real world.  While I currently think the X2 is the best pump on the market, I’m not brand loyal to Tandem.  I’m out of warranty in five months, and gathering all the info I can to make my next decision.  I’m a little too excited for the unveiling of Tandem’s T:sport (working name, might be different when it comes to market later this year), though, so I might be biased.

I don’t know the answer to that, John. But, I know that this pattern wont exist forever. It might have something to do with covid lockdown. I’ve had terrible probs during covid. I’m suspicious that it has something to do with my new lockdown lifestyle.

I have been doing that during the first (larger) part of covid lockdown.
But, in order to bring the bolus dose down into something reasonable/typical for me (2 units/15g), I have to increase the basal to really pretty dangerously high levels.
I’ve been doing the best that I can with those. But, I have had more frequent and more severe lows that I ever have had in 20 years. I’m usually not very scared of lows, but I have become so during covid.
I will now refer to this persistent goofy pattern that has been vexing me for months as “the covid pattern.” I’ve trouble shooted this a lot of different ways, all of which work for a while, but are less than ideal and bordering on dangerous.
I just went out and shoveled because we have more snow coming. I made a nice path for cat and dog to walk down and go poo poo without getting cold, wet feet. I ate. No problems. I feel kinda comfortable assuming this covid pattern has something to do with really unusual inactivity levels.",11d

I assume this refers to GI side effects/diarrhea. For what it’s worth, it’s fairly variable how this plays out—I’ve never had any noticeable effects from it. For some folks it’s severe and ultimately not tolerable. For most somewhere in the middle. Worth a try to see where you land.
I tried invokana as a different t2 med option, and would not recommend it. I found, similar  to some other folks’ reports on here, that at first it seemed like a miracle drug. For a few weeks, it was like my control issues were miraculously improved, and I couldn’t break 200 if I tried. That pretty quickly wore off and it basically stopped being effective while continuing to make me more vulnerably to dehydration and yeast infections. Then I had one kidney test result that went from no protein to a lot (like levels indicating moderate kidney disease). Still not sure if that value was a fluke/mistake or what, but that was the last straw. I went off of it, without a major shift in control. Kidneys have been back to perfect since. If it had only continued to work as well as it did at first, I might have tried to sort out if that was a real issue or not, but hardly seemed worth it.",11d

I typically take 29 units of Levemir in the morning and 7 units at bedtime. This morning I administered my morning dose and immediately thought, “did I already do this?” I cannot for the life of me remember if I already gave it. So, I definitely have my usual 29 units in but I may have an additional 29. I took in 44g of fast acting carbs about an hour after just because I had given myself my fast acting previously bc I was about to eat so I was naturally dropping. I spiked to over 400 which is a new record for me. I’ve been sitting in the 200’s since then and haven’t eaten since. I’m almost 8 hours in from when I know I injected so I think I’m about where the insulin would peak. Surely by now I would have had some lows related to if I did actually give an additional 29 units, right? Just trying to decide if I’m in the clear and can correct and eat! Thoughts?",9d
961,Help! I MAY have doubled up on my long acting!,Type 1 and LADA,Type 1 and LADA,Robyn_H,2,"The only real problem you ran into is the 55g carb correction.  Levemir is a slow acting.  You had eight hours to basically correct for half you dose (the other half gets used even more slowly over the next 16ish hours), but you had all the correction in your blood stream by the 1:15 hour mark.  So yep, I would definitely correct.
Basically, overdosing on Levemir isn’t as scary as it would be to overdose on short-acting.  You just have to be aware and vigilant.  You’re right to be worried around the 8 hour mark, because that’s when you’ll be most likely to have a big hypo if it’s going to happen, but it won’t come on terribly fast.  You’ll have plenty of time to treat it.
Next time you suspect you may have doubled up, don’t panic. You can wait if out to see if you’re even trending lower than normal.  If you are, rather than treat with fast acting carb you want to try and delay digestion with protein and fat.  Crackers with cheese and/or peanut butter would be great.  This would also be an excellent day for those notoriously difficult foods to bolus for.  You just built an extended bolus into your day (at that 8 hour mark) for pizza or Chinese food.
Personal choice, but I might knock a unit or 2 off that 7-unit dose, too, since you might still have insulin working from the double up.  You’ll have to decide before then if you think you did actually get the double up or not.  If you’ve got CGM, I wouldn’t bother reducing the second injection, as the CGM will alert you to too much insulin.  If not, I would reduce, because if be afraid to sleep through the night with possible extra insulin on board.

Same for me.  I’ve used two different medtronic pumps prior to tslim this year.  Medtronic sensors are terrible.  In hindsight, I should have asked them for my money back for my link 1 and 2 transmitters and sensors - it was the worst value investment I ever made.  I still had sensors left that I paid out of pocket that I didn’t use because they were stressing me out so much because of the inaccuracies.   When i called support, they made it sound like it was only me having these problems and I was the “one off” case that didn’t work so I just thought it was my bad luck.  It was only this year that I realised so many others were in the same boat.  The medtronic pump good and comparable to the tslim I think however, tslim I think is more forward thinking.
It saddens me that medtronic is still the major player in the australian market.  When I had to choose my new pump, I had my mind set on the tslim but my DE tried to convince me to go medtronic.  I think they are trained and have more support from medtronic so they are more comfortable with that pump.  She also gave me the impression the generation 3 of the medtronic sensors were close to flawless.

When gyms & cardiac rehab programs closed, I researched at home exercise options. I found a system that allows one to exercise all body parts.


They have aTRX system at my gym and I really like it. They are anchored to a pipe suspension system about two feet above my head. I didn’t get one for home because I don’t have a location where I could mount it in this fashion. You can use it on a door jam, but really haven’t investigated what kind of capabilities you lose in that configuration.
Another option is resistance bands. My wife purchased these and loves them. The training videos are great, the trainer is very responsive to his e-mails,  and most are free.
I’m going back to my gym twice a week now for one-on-one training only. The place is relatively small.  The ventilation system and hygiene protocols are very good. They limit the number of members in at one time via an on-line reservation system that requires 24 hour notice. I know the owner and she understands my situation. I go during their normal slow times and she only lets two other members in while I’m there. I may start using the their treadmills once a week when they’re not busy.

Depending on the exercise you can use them attached to a door (place the door attachment accessory between the door and door jam, then close the door) or stand alone. Some exercises you can use either one. My wife uses both. While we haven’t done it, it’s also possible to use them in the attached mode wherever there is a sturdy structure like the piping you might have in your basement or at a park.
I’m pretty sure you can find some examples if you search on the owner (Dave Schmidt) on YouTube. Or he’s very responsive to e-mails.
Overall we’re pleased. I use them a sometimes. I bought them for my wife, but she’ll let me use them if I behave  My only caution is get a pair of the exercise gloves for the free-standing exercises. Holding the band under resistance would beat up my hands if I didn’t have them.",Sep '20

1023,Playing doctor with acarbose,Type 2,Type 2,Sam_F,1,"My family has insurance problems, so my dad is afraid to go get diagnosed as diabetic despite being aware of his condition. If he’s diagnosed with diabetes, he’ll never be able to get new insurance again, but the company we have now is treating us horribly. American health insurance is tragic, but that’s not the topic here. So help me out with this doctor-less diabetes treatment situation.
His numbers have been below 200, but above 130 after meals. He’s making some huge changes to his diet with my help, and has started eating low carb and started to exercise more. This seems to be helping, and he’s losing weight.
But I think it might not be enough; I think he will need to go on medication. Without a doctor in the picture, this is problematic. I subscribe to Jenny’s view in her truth about oral diabetic drugs article (http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14045911.php 1), wherein metformin isn’t an effective way to prevent the onset of diabetes. It just masks the onset. Instead, I like acarbose, and I want to start him on it. I understand that patients start off taking 25 mg of acarbose 3 times a day (eaten with the first bite of every meal) and then adjust their dose thereafter, up to 50mg and then no more than 100mg. Possible side effects include gas and diarrhea, which can be limited by eating less carbs and especially less wheat. It should be avoided if there are problems with “iron deficiency, kidney disease, liver disease, stomach/digestive or intestinal disorders, any allergies.” It interferes with “‘water pills’ (diuretics), thyroid hormone, steroids, digoxin, estrogen hormone, birth control pills, phenytoin, isoniazid, other drugs that treat diabetes, phenothiazines (e.g., chlorpromazine), niacin, adrenalin-like drugs (e.g., albuterol, metaproterenol, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine), calcium blockers (e.g., nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem), certain digestive aids (e.g., amylase, pancreatin).” Used alone, there should be no hypos, but we’ll start checking his blood sugar more often and be prepared for it.
I think my dad isn’t going to go to a doctor, but we need to do something. What do you think about my plan to start him off on this? I can order it online from Canada. I know it’s a bad idea, I know it’s not recommended, but you all know how fun it is footing the bill. I’ve done all my type 1 treatment on my own, everything short of writing insulin prescriptions, and I think my dad and I will be fine with my help. Later on, it’s very likely that his numbers won’t turn around and he’ll end up going to a doctor, but he won’t go unless he has to.

It didn’t fully go away after birth, I still had high postprandial blood sugars, I managed it with diet. Second pregnancy I was on insulin in my first trimester. After my second pregnancy, it seemed to go away. I had repeated A1Cs that were 5.0, the last one was in August. A few weeks ago I noticed some symptoms, exhausted, constantly hungry, thirsty a lot, suddenly gaining weight after my weight being pretty stable for almost 2 years (since the second baby). Sure enough, my fasting blood sugar is now over 100 (postprandial seems ok, basically the opposite of how it was before ). I had a lot of testing early on, because my family history and presentation made me “atypical.” So I know I’m negative for MODY 1-5. As of almost 5 years ago I was negative for ICA, GAD and 1 other antibodies, and c-peptide was normal. Three years ago my fasting insulin was low (<2.0) but my fasting blood sugar was 91 so that doesn’t necessarily mean anything.
I have an appointment next week, but long story short, it looks like Prediabetes. Ok, so I need to go back to a low carb diet. I’ve done it before, I know how, and I can stick to it.

My story may be long, sorry for that.
A little history, have been T2D for over 20 years, diagnosed in my early 30’s, I’m now 51. I’ve been through most oral meds, Bydureon, Byetta, and have been on Lantus for about 7 years and recently added Januvia 100mg to the Lantus 30units taken in the morning. Most recent A1C in June was 7.
The main reason for my post is in the past year or so I’ve had 4 or 5 severe lows after dosing my Lantus. For example:
805pm - 160
854pm- 36
This scares the crap out of me. The most recent one was two weeks ago and again, large, fast drop in a short time frame.
My doctor recently switched me to Tresiba and have been taking 26 units in the morning along with the 100mg Januvia. I experience DP and have been running around 150-180 fasting, which I know is high. But I’m scared sh*tless when it comes times to dose Tresiba. Shaking and testing every 3-4 minutes until I’m convinced my sugar isn’t going to crash.
I don’t want to live this way. I need to rebuild trust but I’m at a loss how to do that. I also would like some answers about why my BS dropped so fast with Lantus. My PA-C and endo are both puzzled. I have thoughts about this but…sorry, it just sucks.

Well, you get the idea. A hundred and one things including your diabetes pills all affect your blood glucose. Have you thought about using a continuous glucose monitor? If you don’t already use one, this is the missing piece for your peace of mind and safety. It can sound an alarm that will help you catch and counteract those scary hypos.
I lived with dosing insulin for 25 years without a CGM. With a bit of luck, I managed to survive through some crazy scary lows.
In addition to the safety benefits of a CGM, it is the single best teacher to help you learn how insulin, other meds, food, exercise and stress all affect your glucose levels. Your endo and PA can only make guesses after you give them the rough details of what happened after a scary low. The CGM will warn you in real time that you’re about to walk over a cliff.
After 37 years of using insulin, I think flying blind without a CGM is a poor choice and risky business. I apologize if my strong opinion may offend; I’ve crashed and burned too many times. If you use insulin, you will eventually go low. There’s no getting around that.
When I took a pump vacation a few years back, I used Tresiba as my basal insulin. I found that it provided a nice steady and peakless ride. Just keep in mind to allow 2-3 days between making any dose changes and judging whether it’s working or not.",24d

150-180 fasting


I don’t feel bad about these numbers.
We are in such a high risk time that running a little higher might be preferable than running on the low side (especially if you have seen some disruptive/concerning lows).
I’ve been running aggressive insulin dosages that put me on the low side and I have also had some severe lows during the pandemic. I don’t think that was practical. I now believe that I was being a little irresponsible, given the current state of the world.

I don’t want you to live in a state of fear. I agree with @Terry4 that you are well suited for a CGM, especially if you are taking insulin and especially if you are hypo-shy. There’s just nothing that could benefit you more - physically, emotionally, and intellectually.

I do use a CGM, currently the Dex G6.

Also, they loosen the guidelines for blood sugar control for seniors because of low blood sugars. Low’s are particularly dangerous for those of us in our “golden years.” A blood sugar of 36 is very dangerous. I hope that never happens to you again.

1048,T2 diabetes and anxiety,Type 2,Type 2,cardamom,2,"The reason you were having those issues w Lantus is almost definitely specific to Lantus (and other biosimilar insulins) and how it works. When you inject Lantus, it crystallizes in your tissue due to pH differences in your body, and then those crystals dissolve slowly over about 20-24ish hours to work as insulin. That’s great when it works, but if you accidentally inject into a blood vessel, Lantus doesn’t crystallize properly and can instead all start working right away (or this may happen to some of the dose). Then instead of a gradual effect, you drop like a rock. Tresiba doesn’t work like this at all, which is probably why your doc switched you (neither does Levemir, but that tends to require 2x a day dosing). Do not worry about the same thing happening—it won’t. There is no way to use Tresiba that will result in a quick drop. That said, with Tresiba, you want to raise the dose very gradually, giving each adjustment 3-4 days to fully kick in, before raising again, because it is so long-lasting.
Also you may need a CGM, but you really may not, if the Lantus issue was the only time you had that kind of low. It will never hurt of course, and if you can get it great, but I don’t think from just what you’ve said alone you have reason to be anxious without it.

You can test DP by setting your alarm and testing at 4:30-5 am and your BG probably hasn’t increased yet.
The only thing that can be done about it is to take extra insulin just to combat it, Some people wait until they get up and give a shot first thing. Some people say a keto diet can help, but that doesn’t work for a lot of people.
The easiest way is to get an insulin pump, mine isn’t as bad as it used to be and sometimes I don’t barely have it anymore, but I used to set my pump to deliver 3x my normal hour dose between 5-7 am. Now I need just a slight nudge more. But I have another nudge that starts when I first get up.
This hormone release also causes insulin resistance, you need more insulin in the am for anything you eat or to bring down your numbers. Frankly it was easier for me just not to eat in the am and I still usually don’t.

My initial guess is that 1) you are eating that 1 meal within 4 hours of going to bed.  If so, eat that meal a lot earlier where your daily activities will work off some of the glucose and calories.  Try to eat that big meal at least 10 hours before going to bed.  2) Look at how many carbohydrates you are eating in that big meal.

But as someone who’s taken insulin most of her life, I want to seriously stress that insulin in a scary and dangerous game.  The potential side effects of insulin are WAY worse than you’ll find with oral medications.  I seriously doubt you’ll find a single type 1 among us who has never had a life-threatening hypo.  Given the insulin-resistance of type 2, you’ll likely need unusually large amounts of insulin, increasing the inherent danger.  It’s not something i would wish on anyone unless you absolutely need it.
I feel like you’re making this decision much too lightly if you’re making it just to avoid nausea and/or diarrhea.  Aside from hypoglycemia, potential adverse reactions to the DRUG insulin (it’s still a pharmaceutically manufactured drug, don’t be misled because it mimics a natural hormone.  The drugs are different) include: allergic
reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash, pruritus, Onychomycosis, sensory disturbance, urinary tract infection, chest pain, headache, skin disorder, abdominal pain, sinusitis, DEATH, etc…  Does insulin still sound like your first treatment choice???  This is precisely why you SHOULD expect pushback from your doctor.  It’s not the safer nor easier option you seem to think it is.
Myself, and a lot of other Type 1s, have started taking Metformin in addition to insulin, because it reduces the amount of basal (background/long-acting) insulin I need.  So I speak from experience when I tell you that Metformin does get better.  The first month undeniably and absolutely sucks, but then I never experienced the GI distress again.  And honestly, even if the side effects never faded, I would take them any day in lieu of insulin, if I could.
Thankfully there are other options if you don’t want the Metformin.  Every prescription drug comes with a scary list of potential side effects, but that doesn’t mean they are common or that you’ll experience any of them.

Truth be told, most if not all doctors are likely to view your request from the frightful perspective expressed in Robyn’s earlier post. So I’m not optimistic about your chances of being prescribed insulin, if that is what you still believe you actually want. But the only way to find out is to discuss it with your doctor and find out how that goes.
For what it’s worth, here’s what happened with me back in mid 1978.
I was an enlisted man in the Navy in my mid 20s going to language school in Monterey, CA. My fasting blood glucose was extremely high and I was down about 40 lbs to a noticeably skinny 160, so I was diagnosed as an adult-onset (i.e. T2) diabetic and put on whatever oral medication they prescribed back then.
While I was home on leave in December, I saw a civilian physician in Milwaukee who gave me a glucose tolerance test. The test showed I was producing 1/2 of the insulin expected so he recommended I take supplemental insulin. In today’s terms, I was not a T2 but a LADA T1, a distinction the medical community was only starting to recognize at that time.
However that doctor didn’t (couldn’t?) prescribe insulin for me. Instead, I brought it up with an Air Force doctor I saw when I returned from leave to my next training school in Texas. After consulting with the civilian doctor, I was prescribed the supplemental regular insulin the civilian doctor recommended.
So I picked up that the insulin and syringes from the base pharmacy and then went back to my room and proceeded to use it as prescribed. Yes, I had episodes of hypoglycemia. Did it kill me? Not that I recall.  Still, I doubt that this is unlikely to be the experience anyone else would have.

Basal insulins, like Lantus, are very different from fast acting meal insulins like Novolog, which are all different from the old-school insulins like R and NPH. My understanding is that it’s pretty common to put T2s on Lantus alone if insulin therapy is indicated. It’s a much flatter effect curve, and much less likely to cause hypos. That may be what your mother and brother are taking. It would worth finding out. It basically just kind of boosts your overall insulin availability without the peaks.

 Robyn_H:

Given the insulin-resistance of type 2, you’ll likely need unusually large amounts of insulin, increasing the inherent danger. It’s not something i would wish on anyone unless you absolutely need it.


I’m not disputing what @Robyn_H says here but I do want to temper it a little bit.  I do so out of experience. Being Type 2 and very insulin resistance I am the perfect example of what she says, I can do some industrial size boluses. I am human and I can make mistakes that would make me susceptible to crushing lows considering the size of my boluses.
I have had some low, my worse ever were in the mid forties and I was functional, I have never felt I had a low that I felt was life threatening. I credit my good fortune to the remaining amount of natural insulin production I have left. I believe it acts as a buffer to extreme lows.
Even with what I just said I cannot and do not discount what @Robyn_H said. A failing pancreas can be a fickled thing, I do not try to out think it.
I did not start with insulin, I went thru the whole oral meds routine, I did not ask for insulin, I avoided it, but once I started it I realized it was the best treatment for me. That was me after 15years on orals, insulin was finally something that really worked.
I have no love affair with insulin, it is a love/hate thing. I am past the point of no return. I couldn’t go back to oral meds if I wanted to but if I could I would consider it. Using insulin is no walk in the park. It takes constant attention, and constant preparation. It involves itself in every decision and every aspect of your life. When you are insulin dependent diabetic there are no time outs, or days off, or minutes off, or even seconds. It may not consume 100% of your thoughts but it and all that goes with it consumes at least a small percentage 100% of the time.
Although I had no choice in the matter but to start insulin I realize that when I chose insulin I chose the best thing and the worst thing at the same time. I also gave up something that I can never regain, a sense of freedom, never again can I leave my house without thinking, am I OK on the insulin front.",Dec '20

While i’ve read about how careful you have to be with insulin, i also feel like I’ve heard a lot of the “finally something that works” theme from so many posters. so i think my brain went to the shortcut of “why bother with all these confusing meds”. But the “put off insulin until you really need it” approach seems smart too.
Because I was controlling my numbers fairly well without meds as recently as a year ago, i feel like i’m still hanging on to that mindset. However, I’ve had a bit of numbness in my big toes in the last week or two, which is the wake up call that sent me to the lab.

But it is non-trivial because it is potentially dangerous stuff and you need to know what you’re doing. It may be useful to see it from the Dr’s p.o.v. It’s a very unusual situation to prescribe this stuff: a drug that can put your patient into a coma or worse, but you have to let them administer it to themselves with no medical supervision, multiple times a day, in dosages that can vary all over the place and that they have to figure out themselves.

This theme began with a couple of members that took it upon themselves to start insulin without doctors approval. Both were very informed members with the knowledge to pull it off. It worked out well for both of them. There are advantages for a T2 to start insulin treatment earlier.

I knew a lady about 35 years ago whose GP prescribed only insulin for diabetes of either type, and she said she could take an entire bottle and her sugar would not go down.
Third, the standard treatment for Type 2 is initially Glucophage, which eventually stops working, and must be supplemented. Since we still do not understand the best treatment for Type 2, the best treatment after Glucophage stops working is not clear: some say to switch to a different oral medication, others say add another oral medication to Glucophage, some say add insulin to Glucophage, while some say add both another oral medication and insulin to Glucophage.

I just add 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp salt substitute (measurements form Dr. Bernstein, but for 1 quart of liquid, when vomiting/diarrhea) and some magnesium powder. I am 55 yo and have decreasing estrogen, but I don’t consistently have hot flashes at night. I also see a correlation between hot flash frequency and if I have fasted for half the day the day before. Fasting is known to increase cortisol levels. Low carb can lead to mild dehydration, and the advice  I have seen is to increase salt intake to combat this. Bright lights at night can also raise cortisol levels- if I pay attention to reducing bright light exposure at night, I also get fewer hot flashes. So my list of things that seem to raise cortisol and increase my hot flashes are: fasting, bright light at night, and being low on electrolytes, emotional stress.

What type diabetes do they say you have. Sounds like they are treating for type 2 but what ever they are missing the mark. With readings in the range you describe more needs to be done. Have they considered that you might be type 1 diabetic, have they done any antibody testing.
I have moved @Holly3’s post to a new topic
Gary",Oct '20
1100,Diet after DKA,Type 2,Type 2,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,2,"You don’t mention anything about taking insulin and that sounds to me  that you need it.
40% of us type 1’s are misdiagnosed as type 2’s at first and it happens constantly. One of the problems is as a type 1/LADA you still make insulin for a while until you finally completely stop, sometimes up to 8 years or more. That period you still make insulin we call the honeymoon period. And drugs and change of diet work at first and slowly stop as you make less and less insulin.
DKA is way more common with type 1, although some medications can cause it in a type 2. DKA is caused not by high blood sugar numbers but a lack of insulin which usually occurs at high numbers. But it’s the lack of available insulin that actually causes the issue.
You don’t say what type they have said you are, but I am assuming since you don’t mention insulin you have been told you are type 2.
If you haven’t gotten them already I think you need to be tested for type 1. The 2 most important are an antibody test and a c-peptide test. On an antibody test if you have antibodies you are a type 1, although some type 1’s will test negative but still not make insulin and they don’t know why. The second is a c-peptide which shows how much insulin you are making. Low or low normal is a sign of type 1 as you make less and less insulin until you stop, high or high normal is a sign of type 2, because you still make insulin you just don’t utilize it right and your body will try to make more to make up for it.
Your liver makes glucose for fuel whether you eat or not. So even drinking water as a type 1 your blood sugar level will go up because you are lacking insulin to deal with it.
I’m sorry you are going through all this. good luck and I hope you feel better soon. I hope you find your answers.

I got diabetes as a toddler after getting the flu. You need to see an endocrinologist as soon as possible and demand testing for type 1. If you are not eating and your BG’s are that high you are at constant risk of going into DKA again.
The reason your BG’s were normalized in the hospital is probably due to the electrolytes they were giving you and they may even have given you some insulin to bring you down but didn’t prescribe you any to take afterwards so your BG’s have crept back up into dangerous territory. Keep drinking water and add an electrolyte supplement to it that does not have carbs. Emergen-C makes one and there are several others out there. Alternatively Gatorade zero or Powerade zero are also safe and will help replenish lost electrolytes from the high BG. The risk with DKA is kidney damage or failure so do whatever you need to to stay out of that range.
Go to the pharmacy and pick up urine ketone test strips and and a blood ketone meter and strips if they have them and check your ketones daily or if you are throwing up. This will all get sorted out soon and you will get on a proper treatment plan. Please keep us posted and if you start experiencing symptoms of DKA again go to the emergency room.",Oct '20

1131,My Ozempic Experience,Type 2,Type 2,James_Hurley,,"I found out that I was heading towards Type 2 back in 2016.  I was first put on Metformin which made little difference, especially in my post-meal readings.  My A1C continued to climb and I found out that I was over 8 which scared me quite bad.  My endo added Jardiance, which helped quite a bit, but still wasn’t bringing my numbers down where I’d like them to be.  A few months ago, we decided to add Ozempic.  It’s been a mixed blessing of sorts.
I started with the .25 dose, once weekly, for the first month.  Immediately, I had waves of naseau, mild diarreha and occasional cramping.  About 3 days in, I ate a carb-heavy meal one evening and spent the next two days with incredibly bad diarreha, cramps, and a general feeling that I had an intestinal virus.  No vomiting though.  Immediately, I noticed my numbers were improving dramatically.  Many times, falling below 100 post-meal which I had not see in years.  I also, pretty rapidly, lost 15 pounds and have maintained that weight loss.  I gained 95 lbs over 10 years and truly believe this is where the Type 2 started.  My hope is major weight loss will reverse or put it into remission.
Last week, I upped the dosage to the .5 weekly and have experienced all of the above symptoms over again.  It’s really tough to have near constant diarreha and other GI issues.  If not for the dramatic blood sugar results, I would have long tossed this into the trash. Along with the Metformin and Jardiance, things are changing for the positive but I don’t know how long I can handle the GI issues.
I’d love to hear others experience with this medication.

When you are doing everything right and things don’t make sense you could be a misdiagnosed type 1 and not a type 2, 40% of type 1’s are misdiagnosed as a type 2 at first. I was for over 8 years.
If things keep not making sense you might request further lab work. First an Antibody Test. A positive is a sign you are a type 1, but some type 1’s test negative but don’t make insulin and they don’t know why. And a C-peptide Test which tells how much insulin you are producing. A low or low normal is a sign of being a type 1. High or high normal is a sign of being a type 2. A type 2 still produces insulin but usually at a higher level because they aren’t utilizing it properly and the body tries to make more to make up for it.
Diets changes and medication can work at first because as a type 1 you still make some insulin for a while.
I’m not saying you are, I’m just saying to keep it in mind.

1152,No change in A1c,Type 2,Type 2,irrational_JohnType 1 or LADA,,"My third question, which I should have thought of in my original post, is how much time elapsed between these A1c tests?
A decrease in your blood glucose levels does not cause the amount of glycated hemoglobin in your blood to drop immediately. It takes a period of time for this to happen which is why the A1c is viewed as an indicator of “average” blood glucose.
However, this also means that if the tests are too close together, you may not see any change.  My understanding is that a period of at least three months is recommended between consecutive tests.

Maybe this is the reason for the seemingly better numbers, you are testing when your BS is better. To counteract our own bias, you should aim for consistency, and test for better control. From studies I have read, the best time to test is 60 to 90 minutes after your meal. Even better, test when you eat, and test 90 minutes afterward. Since your meal composition, and the highs created by it, are what you want to manage.
As for reducing those peaks, focus on tasty low-glycemic index food, in smaller amounts, so instead of 2 big meals, 4 little ones, or even 5 little ones.
As for bringing the numbers down in general, try exercise, or exercise more, or exercise better. Exercise is key to increasing your insulin sensitivity, and that will help your native insulin function better to bring down your A1c.

The tests to determine if you are, are first an antibody test. If it’s positive it’s a sign of being a type 1. Some type 1’s test negative and they don’t know why. The next is a c-peptide. This tells you how much insulin you are making.  Low or low normal is a sign of type 1, high or high normal is a sign of type 2. Type 1’s are lacking insulin and that takes a little bit of time to completely happen, sometimes years. Type 2’s are insulin resistant and still make insulin but don’t utilize it properly so they actually are usually trying to produce more to make up for it.
Everyone is saying to watch out for DKA. This is because this is how a lot of type 1’s end up being diagnosed because they get sick from DKA. DKA is caused by a lack of insulin. It can be serious and usually happens only to a type 1. It rarely can occur in a type 2.

Yeah, but are Type 2s often running in the 400-500s when fasting, like OP describes? Anyone who does that, regardless of diagnosis, is clearly insulin deficient I’d think, and insulin deficiency is what puts one at risk for DKA. If your body can’t metabolize your blood glucose, even when you aren’t even eating anything new, it’s going to have to switch over to metabolizing fat instead, which means ketones, and if that’s happening at an extreme level, especially combined with the dehydration from high blood sugars,  that is what leads to DKA, which is when your blood chemistry gets off balance. Definitely worth heading off with IV fluids and insulin before it gets severe!
Another rough check for high levels ketones/DKA is to ask someone, if you’ve got someone in your germ pod, to smell your breath. Ketone breath is sort of sweet/fruity. Not nearly as good as an actual test like with urine or blood strips, but if that’s there, time to act.",Nov '20

If you haven’t started making ketones yet, you can prevent it with insulin that they can give you to lower your blood sugar.  At the very least go out and get some ketone strips so you can see more of what is going on. Those numbers show a lack of available insulin, and that is what causes DKA. The thirst is a desperate way of your body trying to flush them out. But it is obvious you need insulin so a trip to the ER is the best solution.

I went about 6 months using finger sticks before I asked for a CGM (it was not offered or even discussed by the GP) and have been on one for about a year and a half.  Without it, there’s too much opportunity to dismiss a high or low as an effect of when you poked your finger relative to a meal, etc. and it’s nearly impossible to accurately see effects of different meals or exercise on a several-hour timeframe.  Let alone see nighttime trends.
Again, personally and without a lot of experience to back it up, I would push for a monitor with high/low alarms while they are adjusting your med list and doses.
My doctor focused on the meds and did not consider other things that I changed in my life.  If you’ve reacted to the diagnosis like a lot of people and overcompensated in the exercise direction, diet changes, etc. make sure the doctor understands and factors that into the med adjustments.  Particularly if you think your changes are not sustainable – they’re trying to adjust things with medications while you’re adjusting them with diet and exercise and unless people talk it will delay you getting to a happy/healthy steady state.

I am a 29 year old caucasian male, who for the last ~10 years has been slowly making my towards the higher end of the “overweight” range of a BMI chart.
Went for an annual physical today, had a slightly elevated BP (132/88), and bloodwork from two weeks prior gave me a FBG of 108. Historically I’ve hovered around 100- once or twice a little over, but usually under. Everything else- cholesterol, triglycerides, etc, are not even close to being out of spec.
My (new) doctor, for the sake of being thorough, gave me an A1C test and it came back as 6.5%- I’ve never taken this test before.
This surprised me given the FBG would indicate i’m not diabetic. I’ve also been dieting (~1600 calories per day, high fiber and protein, lower carbs, gov’t-recommended levels of fat) since July and have lost ~15 pounds thus far, down from 220. Most of this weight loss was from July through September, and since then I’ve sort of regressed but haven’t added any weight back on.
Due to COVID though I’m not super active- I run 2-3 miles once a week and haven’t been able to do much weight training since the gym is closed.
It seems to me like more testing needs to be done, but… what do you guys think? I do have some history of Type II in my family, and my diet hadn’t been ideal prior to my new diet/weight loss (higher fats and carbs, drink alcohol fairly frequently, etc), and I may have some sleep apnea issues (unsure how frequent this happens, may only be if I drink in the evening). Other than that though, I’m genuinely surprised and don’t see a clear reason why I’d suddenly develop diabetes.

Welcome to our community!!!
Yes, absolutely.  Buy yourself a Contour Next meter and some test strips and start testing before you meals, 1 hour after meal and 2 hours after meal and keep a good record.  You will quickly start to learn what is driving your blood sugar up and what to avoid for food/drink.  If you plan to fix your issue with little to no medications, it will be tough to do on your own given your weight.

Keep in mind that if you do have T2 or prediabetes, that increasing insulin resistance (which is when your body doesn’t use the insulin it makes effectively) might actually be causing weight gain as much or more than caused by it (so the good news is that treating insulin resistance can also help some folks with weight loss).

I started the CGM because I realized I wasn’t going to get the same type of care from my new endo. The last endo was analytical, and we often spent an hour or more talking, analyzing my lifestyle and insulin usage, so my A1c’s were quite good. My new doctor, whom I really appreciate, just isn’t deep into the numbers, although better with lifestyle tips, and I could see my numbers slip slightly to 7.2 and then recovering a bit to 7.0. That is when I realized I needed to take more control, so requested a CGM.
As for the pandemic, I eat healthier and more controlled under lockdown. Initially, I lost five (5) pounds. but some normal lifestyle habits have crept back in. My spouse started visiting her mother weekly to have dinner, and she returns with two (2) restaurant meals for me, which I eat over successive nights. Because of the timing, I wind up having to skip a workout on Friday evening, so my targeted five (5) times per week is now four (4). Also, my spouse has caved in to snacking carbs while we were at home, as opposed to better quality meals out with friends. Although my spouse is partly responsible for the excellent aspects of the diet I do eat, the healthiest I’ve ever eaten, she also has some habits that undermine my weight and control.

this is my first post in the forum. I am a 65 years old man who was diagnosed with diabetes type II 25 years ago. Since then I am on medications for my diabetes. For the last 5 years I have been using Byetta 10 micro-gram twice a day along with Metformin 1000 mg twice a day, Glymberide 4 mg twice a day, and 45 units of Levimere long acting insulin at midnight. My HbA1c levels were 7-8 most of the time. Last week my diabetes doctor switched me to Trulicity1.5mg and I am supposed to start using it soon. But when I read the warnings about its side effects I felt very scared. I felt even more scared when I Googled the subject and read the scary comments by people who used Trulicity on the following link:


realdiabetestruth.com 149


Why Trulicity Could Be A Truly Dreadful Diabetes Drug  : Real Diabetes Truth 149
Trulicity, a once-a-week injection from Eli Lilly and Co, which has been fast-tracked onto both the American and European markets, despite serious concerns over its safety.





The comments on the article in the above link were all very negative and tell serious painful stories. Now, I am puzzled, what to do? Shall I go back to my doctor and tell him I am good with Byetta for the last 5 years and don’t want to take the risks associated with Trulicity or shall I switch as he prescribed to me. I have already the Trulicity injections (3 months supply) in my refrigerator now but scared to use them. I appreciate sharing your experience and advising me on this situation.

I ask that you consider where the information came from.  I have not read all fo the data and so I am not qualified to comment about the validity, or lack of validity of the information presented.  But I do hope you will use great caution in consulting with Dr. Google for medical advice.  I know I always google my medications and over time one of the things I have found is that for every 5 things I read which are positive, I read about 25 that are negative.
I find the best person to consult is my doctor.   I use some powerful and scary medications.  If a person googles many of those medications it would give anyone pause.  I still use them because i need them.  If I listened only to Dr. Google I would never do it.
It is not that I ignore what I find, it is I looks at the practice outcomes.  To my knowledge. Dr. Google had not graduated from any medical school.  Now if you are concerned that you are not getting the straight scoop, try a second opinion.

I have to tell you, every GLP-1 drug comes with a warning.  Yes, even Byetta.  And absolutely if you have or have had thyroid cancer you probably should not use a GLP-1 drug until there is a better understanding of the risk.  Every drug carries some risk of adverse effects, whether it be gastric distress with metformin, weight gain or hypos from insulin or excessive bleeding with aspirin.  All these risks should be taken in context.  GLP-1 drugs like Byetta and Trulicity have been associated with thyroid cancer in rats.  One human patient (of many thousands) in the Trulicity study had thyroid cancer.  It wasn’t clear whether Trulicity played a role and the FDA could not conclude that there was any connection, hence the black box warning.  Byetta missed the same warning by a single patient.  The bottom line, they have both been associated with thyroid cancer in rats, but there isn’t sufficient evidence to conclude that in humans.  The FDA has a “watch” program where the thousands (if not millions) of patients are observed for thyroid cancer.  If Trulicity (or Byetta) does cause thyroid cancer it will show up and the FDA may alter it’s approval of the drug.  If no thryoid cancer shows up then the FDA will remove the warning.
At this time switching from Trulicity to Byetta probably does nothing about those risks.  You can talk to your doctor about your concerns, but he will likely ask you why you suddenly worried about Trulicity but never had any issue with Betta.

Yes.
Insulet won’t tell you that you can do this. They will tell you to throw it away when the pod expires.
But yes, you can take a syringe and remove most of what is left in the pod. You won’t be able to get all of it because there is a little dead space, but you can definitely get most of it.
Keep in mind, the pod is exposed to your body heat, to hot showers or baths, to sun, etc. And it is on your body for up to 3 days and jostled around, which causes fibrillation and degradation.

Yes, taking basal would help. Basal is the foundation upon which the house is built.
But before starting with a pump, I would examine some of the other options for basal insulin. A pump is good for people who have no basal, because it allows them to totally regulate their changing basal needs every hour. Like if they need different amounts day vs. night.
But since you probably still have some basal still working in your body, you may not need to adjust this hourly. Perhaps a steady long-acting dose of basal insulin for support might be better. Something like a small amount of Tresiba once-per-day, for example.
Another thing that can help the post-meal spikes is bolusing a little sooner before you eat. To give the insulin time to start working. Maybe taking it a little sooner would help you too.",Aug '20

 John70:

Just to be clear, programming and managing basal insulin requirements are kind of the raisons d’etre for pumps to begin with. So that’s probably where any confusion comes from. You’re looking to use it to replicate your regimen, which if I understand it is meal-bolus only, no basal. But pumps are mainly designed to address the problem for T1, that your body needs a continuous trickle of insulin going all the time, and if your pancreas is kerfuft, you don’t have that. You can approximate it with a basal insulin like Lantus, but with a pump you can mimic something much closer to what a real pancreas does by programming different rates throughout the diurnal period depending on your individual metabolism.
So basically you’re looking to use the Omnipod strictly for bolusing without setting a basal rate at all, if I understand you correctly. Dunno if you can zero out the basal settings with that pump, but I’m pretty sure you can with a Medtronic, so probably. The 82-unit minimum is an Omnipod quirk I don’t quite understand, but it probably didn’t strike the designers as a problem since most of their target users are going to have some kind of basal running as well as using it for boluses.",Aug '20

Are you using a CGM? That eliminates a huge amount of the guesswork about what’s going on between meals and fingersticks, and I would regard it as a prerequisite for starting with a pump and using one productively.
Also, responding to @Eric2’s suggestion about exploring using a basal insulin. My understanding of insulin and T2 is mostly anecdotal but my impression is that most T2s start off on a basal insulin like Lantus. And the reasons for that may be very different from how things work for T1s. You’re presumably still generating basal insulin on your own, but there may be ways that using a basal injectable eases the strain and allows you to produce more when you need a bolus, for instance. But I don’t know, and I definitely think this is something you should talk with your endocrinologist about or research more specifically on your own.
Finally, a question: since you aren’t using a basal at this time, why a pump? What problem are you trying to fix? I feel like we’ve sort of backed into asking that question, which should have come first.",Aug '20

1291,Thinking about Omnipods,Type 2,Type 2,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,3,"@John70   I never meant for you to take 45 units at once, just that you would be using 45 units of the 80 unit minimum needed to fill the pod and basal might use the rest. That doesn’t sound like the case since you aren’t doing any basal dosing.
But I have caught something you have said about dropping too low at night and having to raise your Bg level to 200 before bed???
If that is the case you are probably taking too much of a night/dinner bolus since you are not taking a basal dose.
Our liver makes glucose all day and a basal dose helps compensate for that with a little bit of insulin delivered either by a pump all day or a shot of a long lasting/acting insulin like lantus. People that need insulin usually benefit from some kind of long lasting insulin, although not all.
“Normal” people make insulin as they need it and don’t make too much. So if you are dropping too low, you are getting too much insulin at some point. I know you are taking your dose probably based that you are going too high after your meal. But I would look into a little less insulin being used but changing the timing of taking your insulin. Spiking can be dealt with by taking some insulin a little earlier maybe than you do now. Do not forget to eat if you take some insulin early!
The other possibility is like @Eric2 has said go on a very low dose of basal so you can decrease your bolus amounts.
You shouldn’t have to raise your BG level to 200 because you are dropping too much. at night. That is not the optional way of handling dropping too low.",Aug '20
1292,Thinking about Omnipods,Type 2,Type 2,John70,,"To all on this thread. I do realize a basal dose is the way to have better control.
And if I used more insulin during the day from what normally, use this would be a great deal. I’ve noted that from the use guide that the basal dose has a lot of leeway.
But from what I have read I don’t use the amount of insulin in my present dosing to offset what would be wasted from what the pod requires.
My next step is to contact Omnipod’s Tech Support to see if the Min. of 82 units is hard set or Just a suggestion.

1297,Worst allergic reaction last night! Victoza allergy?,Type 2,Type 2,jean63,2,"I had the worst allergic reaction I’ve ever had last night!!! Scared me a bit. About 30 minutes after I took my Victoza, I started itching like crazy and breaking out in hives. I took about 75 mgs. of benadryl, but the stuff kept spreading so I went to the ER.
They gave me another antihistamine and a shot of decadron (yes, I know the decadron is probably going to raise my blood sugar. ) Anyway, I was relieved that it worked and the hives and itching went away. It was a little scary that my husband couldn’t stay with me.
So, the big questions is
Was the allergic reaction to Victoza?
Another drug I took yesterday?
Or, the crab I ate at 8 pm…
I am calling my PCP when I wake up. I suspect I’ll have to get allergy tested asap.

I’m guessing it was from the crab, especially since this allergy is common in your family.  I wouldn’t try crab again unless you have a dose (or several) of benadryl and are a short distance from an ER.
The other drug you took yesterday, was it new?  If not, how long have you been on it?
I’d offer the same suggestion with future shots of Victoza … if you’re going to take it again … have a dose or several of benadryl handy and be a short distance from an ER.",May '20

I would avoid anything that you think may have triggered the reaction until you can see your GP or an allergist and get their advice. I hope you can talk to your GP as soon as possible about how to handle this diabetes-wise. It might be worth asking your GP for a prescription for an EpiPen to keep on hand until you can get in for allergy testing (since that will likely have to wait until after the pandemic). If you have a food allergy, you’ll likely end up being prescribed an EpiPen anyway. Antihistamines like Benadryl may help the symptoms of a mild allergic reaction, but they won’t do anything to stop anaphylaxis from progressing.

Yes, and you can also be having a life-threatening reaction with NO hives or breathing difficulty. Definitely not the stereotypical reaction most people have in mind when they think of anaphylaxis.

1317,First trimester BG control on MDI - 10 wk update,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,daisy707,7,"Hi all!
I wanted to do a little update on here about how my pregnancy and blood sugar is going. I know before getting pregnant I had posted several threads and read a ton because I was so nervous about going through pregnancy with t1d. This might be long winded but I don’t want to forget any details. Just for reference, I am on MDI (Tresiba and Novolog pens) and use a glucose meter.
So far, things have been pretty much normal! Baby had a strong heartbeat at my 8 week ultrasound! So very thankful and relieved for that appointment and ready to go back again! I haven’t had any issues with blood sugar control, aside from needing a bit more insulin. I’ve been very lucky in only battling mild to moderate nausea but haven’t actually gotten sick. Food aversions and nausea were most prevalent weeks 6-8 but now it has eased up. I haven’t had many lows at all; I’m really not sure what weeks most t1d’s experience lows, I’ve read different things. For me though, things have been pretty steady and normal.
I want to also throw out there for anyone thinking about getting pregnant but don’t have a GCM or pump; it is possible to have good, tight control without them. I know I’m not in the later months of pregnancy yet, but I check my sugar (I always have) 8-10 times a day, if not more if I’m more active. I correct if I need to, but I’ve been able to be under 85 fasting, and under 140 two hours after meals (my OB guidelines), and my A1C is 5.3. I was most nervous going into this because so many people told me I can’t do it without those tools, but it is possible. It hasn’t been hard on me, because I’m so used to testing often and correcting anyway; I really think a lot of it has to do with how you know your body and knowing how to control to begin with. I don’t have the option to get those tools because of insurance reasons, so if anyone is in the same boat I want you to know you can do it too!
I go for another ultrasound and bloodwork in two weeks and then we’ll be announcing to everyone! I’m so excited and since we’re getting genetic testing done as well, I was given the option to know the gender early also, which we’re excited about. Genetic testing was for sure happening anyway, so why not know early if I can! I can’t wait. As far as specialists or endos; my OB’s office is fine with me just seeing my primary doc who writes my insulin scripts and such. I actually don’t have a doctor who “monitors” for me. I don’t feel comfortable with anyone telling me what to do with my diabetes, but she is one who I feel comfortable with if I do need help. I make all adjustments myself and she is confident in my self care which is what I needed through this. I know some need more assistance or guidance which is totally fine, but with not having many options near me, I am very thankful that the office is letting me see her instead of their team of endos. I saw an endo in their group prior to becoming pregnant and it was an awful experience (see my endo venting thread). So having my team set up and knowing that I can breeze through this pregnancy without having tons of different docs critiqing my BG managment, really eases my stress. The more I stress about my numbers the more awful they are, but when I can relax and correct as needed, etc. I do just fine.
I was so worried about sever morning sickness, bad lows and just having an awful time. The main thing I’ve battled is fatigue so I’ve been sleeping a ton. I’m so beyond grateful for not having morning sickness like a lot of women do, because I was very scared about extreme BG lows. I’m still keeping an eye out though because one thing I’ve noticed since becoming pregnant is my low symptoms changing. Instead of getting the shakes and things, I’ll just get super nauseous if I drop. That was hard to decifer when I was in my most nauseous weeks, but it seems like my body is leveling out and my low symptoms are starting to get back to normal.
That’s all I have for now and I hope that gives some encouragement to anyone TTC or wanting to, and who are scared. I never, ever thought I would have a baby. For me, so much research and planning about T1D went into this before trying because of my fears but I want you to know that reading and researching is your friend, reaching out via this forum is a great thing to do, and having faith in yourself to have good control is what you need! We’re a lot stronger than we give ourselves cerdit, so don’t focus on the fear too much and know that you can do this too! ",Nov '20

1320,First trimester BG control on MDI - 10 wk update,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,KCCO,1,"I think it’s crazy that standards are so different anywhere you go.
My endo would NOT allow me to stay on Tresiba while pregnant because “it hasn’t been tested on pregnant women” and was still fairly new so I had to switch to that old 12-hour one and take 2 shots a day (can’t remember the name off hand…prepare yourself now for “mom brain” like that…  )
And I was basically forced into seeing a MFM because I was “high risk.” Which ended up a good thing, as you read my post the other day. But not sure why I needed to see them the entire time, instead of just 3rd trimester on.
As soon as my first trimester lows started hitting me, I told my husband that I don’t know why they don’t allow pregnant type 1’s to use a Dexcom for 9 months for free. I definitely couldn’t have done it without one, but my control is much more up in the air than yours seems to be. Kudos!
I also had very limited awareness of lows. Like “Hm, i feel funny” check sugar, 52! Holy crap!

We might have to pay out of pocket.  But I’d like to get it done. I’m not going overboard with testing that’s not really necessary, but this one seems common and accurate so we plan to do it. As for my control; I am honestly so surprised it’s not more all over the place. When I went off the pill and had my menstrual cycle, and even while on the pill at times, it was a crap shoot. It would be high then constant lows, and all over the place for a week and a half. Maybe it’s because I’m more on top of testing now or something, but I’m just thanking God it’s been easy so far! I know it will get more resistant later on, but one day at a time.
I’ve had a feeling this whole time it’s a boy but who knows! I think it takes a week or so for results to come back? I’m not entirely sure but I hope it doesn’t take too long! I’m too excited to wait!  And I was worried about being taken off Tresiba as well, but so glad I can continue taking it. It works so much better for me than any other long acting I’ve tried. And I figured I’d have to see an MFM as well, but so far no. I’ve only had one appointment but so far the group I’m seeing seems comfortable with everything going on. I haven’t been pushed to make appointments with anyone special, and so on. I have a heart condition, thyroid issue and T1D, but they seem to be on top of everything.

1329,8 weeks and sugars flying!,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,allisonm,,"Hi Jennifer - I have three suggestions. Since you didn’t mention whether you have reassessed your insulin dosing - I would say that sometimes in pregnancy, you have to change your basals, carb ratios and/or insulin sensitivity every few days! Around 8 weeks you may expect, generally, to need less insulin across the board through about 16-20 weeks. But everyone is different - if you find yourself going high after meals rather than low, perhaps you will need more insulin for now.
Another suggestion I have is to be sure you are dosing properly for fat/protein since you are low carb. What can compound this issue during pregnancy is that your digestion is slowed to ensure your body gets as many nutrients as it can to baby! So if you are going high well after a meal… perhaps you just need to be doing something like an extended bolus that is more generous to cover that fat and protein.
I would also say that, when you have such a tight BG target, it is tempting to overcorrect all the time. This can also cause a roller coaster effect when you are constantly over dosing for a high BG and then over eating to treat a low. Try to be gentler with your corrections if you believe you are experiencing this.
I wasn’t low carb in pregnancy, but I know many mamas have successful, healthy pregnancies while doing so.

Prior to the pregnancy, I thought I perfected my hypo treatments and would get the lows back to 85. Now i am eating the same amount and staying low but bouncing high after around 35 minutes when I used to come up 15 minutes later. It has to do with the digestion.

1340,Birth control and blood sugars,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,nini6Type 1 or LADA,,"This is a strange fix in my opinion. Hormonal birth control prevents you from ovulating and therefore from forming new cysts. Most ovarian cysts do resolve on their own, however, with regular ovulations. Treating decreased insulin sensitivity during menses with hormonal birth control has in itself has the potential to raise your blood sugar, but continuously. Additionally, use of hbc can, over time, lead to high blood pressure thus increasing a diabetic woman’s chances of eye and kidney disease. If you don’t absolutely need the birth control action of the pill I recommend sympto-thermal charting so you can confirm when you ovulate, and anticipate your menstruation. It is then easy to learn to adjust your insulin regimen for times of hormone shifts, such as menses. It is an important skill to acquire for all diabetic women because the same you would have to do during pregnancies and menopause.  Charting is a powerful health monitoring tool for women, I can point you into the right direction to get started with it if you are interested, I am a certified charting instructor.",Apr '16

If you’ve seen my recent post about a bad endo experience, you would know that my husband and I are TTC. We just started! In preparation for any future negativity from doctors, stress about pregnancy and BG numbers, normal worry that comes from being a soon to be mom, I want to know your experiences! No details are unwelcome and I would love to know your experience rather good or bad! The nitty gritty is what I like to hear so feel free to write a book if you like. If you are currently TTC or just found out, please share what you’ve gone through or are going through right now!
What did you find the most challenging both physically and mentally? What was the most exciting, rewarding, happy, enjoyable about your experience?
I’m glad I’ve found a community that has my back and that I can come and vent to if need be! I’m trying to center my mind to a good place so if this does happen for us, I can spend most of my time enjoying the experience rather than being stuck on stress, etc.
I’d love to hear how pregnancy was for you, your childbirth experiences, and everything in between! I want a thread that I can come back to when I need it most  If you’ve already shared with me, feel free to share again, I won’t mind!

1343,Please share your experiences with me (and all),Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,KCCO,2,"I know this is a bit old but I love sharing my story, so here goes.
I’ve been type 1 since age 14, married at 27, and we started ttc when I was 33. At the time my husband and I decided to TTC, I had a dexcom and used an Omnipod, which honestly made it tons easier to adjust my insulin ratios throughout the whole pregnancy.
I’d also found an endo who I liked, who worked well with me, and who knew we were ttc. I can’t remember offhand what my a1c was when I got pregnant but it was in their “approved” range, whatever that was at the time and dropped to 5.4 at it’s lowest during my pregnancy. They were perfectly ok with letting me be in charge of my blood sugars & insulin during labor if I felt like I could, but I also had been prepping my husband to be able to take over that task if necessary.
We’d been trying different timings and things from March to November of 2017 with no luck. And yeah yeah, docs all say to try for a year before they’ll start looking into infertility issues, but that’s bunk for us type 1’s (I also have Hashimoto’s and MTHFR). And luckily that November I met an ob-gyn who thought so too! She said, there’s no reason to wait a year! And so we started just running basic tests, and I had an hsg, which was no big deal for me, no blockages or anything, but it must have shook something loose because that same month (December 2017) we got pregnant! We found out Jan 2nd, the day we both went back to work after the holidays. I came home on my lunch break to test and texted the results to my husband who couldn’t see them until he got off work that night. Lol, that was a LONG day for me!
So anyways, first trimester was GREAT! Minimal nausea, blood sugars were low and steady, and I felt great! Some food aversions but I mostly ate what I wanted and barely had to bolus because of how low my blood sugars were running. Second trimester was ok, my blood sugars went back up to normal, which was fine and my blood pressure was always perfect. But we had a super stressful event happen (a tree fell on the roof above our bedroom at 2 am) and honestly this trimester was such a blur because of that. I remember going to my mfm appointments and they were always confused because I was type 1 and my endo was monitoring my blood sugars, not them. I never let them touch my pump settings or anything, just reported my latest a1c and they were fine. They were honestly a bit pointless up until the end there. I did get extra sonograms though, and we found out we were having a boy. Which I’d pretty much already known, mother’s intuition. I also had to go into downtown Atlanta to a children’s hospital to get a better sonogram to check little dude’s heart because he was super stubborn (hindsight) and wouldn’t move right so the local office could see. But everything was fine there.
Third trimester was fun. The swelling started. And I’d told my family & friends that if they wanted to throw us a shower they needed to do it sooner rather than later. I just had a feeling. I was due Sept 11th and they originally wanted to schedule my shower for mid-august but I got them to plan it sooner for mid-july. My swelling got progressively worse (started at my toes and just gradually crept up my legs) but my blood pressure was still always perfect and I had no (extra) protein in my urine. So they kept telling me it was normal. Well it was until it wasn’t.
Finally the morning of August 6th, which was a Monday, I had a MFM appointment at 8 am before work. I remember trying to get into the shower and just being so frustrated at how swollen I was that I just cried and cried. I was only 34w6d but I was done. D. O. N. E. Done. My swelling was past my knees and reaching the point where I could hardly bend my legs to walk. I was mad and frustrated and felt so guilty that I then hated being pregnant. And I felt terrible about it all because I had all these plans! opens window tosses plans
I got to my appointment that day and my BP was finally elevated a bit. Then the sonographer couldn’t get little man to move around in there at all. His heart rate was steady, but wasn’t having the accels and decels they look for. So the doctor came in and said “go straight to the hospital.” I didn’t understand that it was so serious and was really tempted to go home and get some clothes and stuff but I didn’t. I called my mom to meet me up there, then texted my husband what was happening since he’d recently gotten permission to have his phone on him at work because of me. I told him he didn’t need to show up yet, that I was pretty sure I was just going to be monitored for a bit and sent home. Texted my boss too.
Got to the hospital and they checked me in and put me in a room. That was new. Usually when they monitor you, they sit you in the triage room for a while. So then I understood things were serious. I called hubs and told him yeah, he needed to head over, but he wanted to stop home & shower first (his job was very dirty). Then the doc called me there in my room and said “I know you were looking forward to labor & delivery and having things a set way, but this boy needs to come out today.” And she was a friend by then so I cried with her on the phone a little bit before she had to go get ready for my surgery. People were in and out of my room, I met nurses and the doc who would be checking over our son, and the anesthesiologist came in & introduced himself. He was rushing everyone but we were waiting for my husband to show up. After he left the room, one of the nurses told me “don’t worry about him, we won’t let you have a baby without your husband here.” So that put my mind at ease.
Finally my husband shows up! He’s given some scrubs that he throws on, and then they’re helping me walk out the door and about 15 feet down the hall to an O.R. which I was surprised about. The nurses helped me onto a table and got me to lean forward for my spinal, which thankfully I didn’t feel at all and it happened so quick that I forgot to get freaked out about it, then they swung my legs around and tossed the drape in front of me and I was already numb. They let my husband in the room, and it really didn’t take long before the doc was pulling our son out! 12:32 I think it was. They held him up for me to see then had to take him away. I was getting shivery and nauseated from the anesthesia and it felt like they took forever to finish up. The doc kept going “there’s so much fluid! That’s a LOT of fluid! There’s just so much fluid!” And I kept saying “I told you so!” Even though they were the ones who told me I had polyhydramos (or however it’s spelled, which just means lots of fluid) but no one ever really explained what it meant.
FINALLY I was sent to recovery for a while. But I was dying to get in and see my boy! I literally felt SO GOOD after all the pressure from the fluid was gone. Like REALLY good. Aaaaand plus you know, pain meds! They finally wheeled me to a room and EVERYONE in my immediate family and my husband’s immediate family was there and I was like…ok, hi? I mean I had a giant incision in me, giant pads under me, and a giant pee bag hanging off the side of the bed so I wasn’t really much in the mood for a party! Thankfully no one stayed long and I got to rest. Ok and this is going to sound weird, but that catheter was amazing. If you ever need one, enjoy it while you can because getting up and down to go to the bathroom while you have a giant incision in your stomach is NOT fun.
I did keep my dexcom on but I THINK I took my pump off. I want to say it was about to expire and I didn’t want to have to deal with it during surgery. My husband could have done it I guess but it was probably also in the way. Hospital food sucked and their “diabetic” meals sucked worse. I had the option to call down and order other stuff but I just never did. The nurses were great the entire time, I was lucky that I had a really good hospital, even though it was a smaller one.
So that was a Monday and I was released on Friday, but that was a hard thing. That was day 4 after “birth” and so the hormones were insane and I kept getting worked up and crying and my BP would go up and they threatened not to release me. But my son couldn’t go home yet, he’d been in the NICU the entire time and had a slight infection, which cleared up well, then was jaundiced, which took forever to clear up it felt like. His blood sugar was also low for a while, which, duh, and we couldn’t do skin to skin or try to breastfeed for longer than I appreciated so the little punk got addicted to eating out of formula bottles and I was never good enough after that. Eye roll I ended up pumping for 7 months but was a low supplier and it stressed me out a lot so I gave it up. He did just fine in the long term on an organic formula we used. But he was finally released the Sunday after we’d arrived, so not too terribly long in the NICU but still made for a long week for us! Having to leave our son at the hospital in the care of others while we went home to sleep and shower was really hard! But we could sit with him in the NICU all day if we wanted and we pretty much did.
And he’s pretty much thrived ever since! He was a big dude at over 7lbs when he was born (everyone kept warning me that my baby would be big if I didn’t stop eating junk eye roll but my endo knew my 5.4 a1c was perfectly fine and kept laughing and saying “we know diabetics just make big babies!” I didn’t eat junk anyways, and my husband and I are both big people. Kiddo’s head circumference is consistently in the 95-99 percentile). He shows no signs of diabetes and has only ever had a few colds. He’s 27 months old and we just started potty training. Toddlers, man. Toddlers.
As for me, my sugars were fairly back to normal after a couple days but I let myself run a bit high in the hospital. I think we cut my basal down by 40-50% right after surgery just to see how the anesthesia treated things and how my body bounced back. My swelling in my legs took several weeks to get back to normal and I had to go back into the hospital for an overnight stay because I needed a debridement on a part of my original incision that just wouldn’t heal. That was fun. I’m still trying to lose the baby weight despite having an a1c in the low 6’s and chasing a toddler around. That is NOT fun and currently despite increasing my basal, increasing my boluses by 40-50%, eating under 30 grams of carbs a day, using new pens of insulin, using a different insulin, and getting some exercise, my blood sugar refuses to budge below 200. So it seems I have a lot of insulin resistance and not sure why right now, but that’s kinda also why I jumped on these threads tonight - to see if it’s common to have high blood sugar before you find out you’re pregnant.  And to see if anyone had any stories about how their second pregnancy was different from their first regarding diabetes.
So anyways. That’s my story! I probably posted it elsewhere in this forum but I like sharing and felt like there was a lot that I, as a first time mom and despite my hours upon hours upon HOURS of research, wasn’t prepared for. I hope this helps!",Nov '20

1346,Carb to insulin ratios with morning sickness,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,daisy707,,"So in my almost 9 years of being a T1D, I haven’t had very many times where I’ve dealt with vomiting and blood sugar management. I just hit 6 weeks pregnant and so far haven’t dealt with much sickness, aside from a little nausea if I don’t eat; until tonight. I just got hit with very bad nausea and I think it’s what I ate (fingers crossed).
My question to all you ladies who have gone through pregnancy with sickness; how did you manage taking insulin to cover carbs, if you end up throwing up those carbs? I just want to know how to plan ahead in case morning sickness hits me hard these next few weeks. Should I eat small and if I’m feeling sick that day maybe take a little less insulin and correct later if needed? My fears are either dropping too low after getting sick, and not being able to keep food down, but I also don’t want to go into DKA if I don’t take enough insulin or get dehyrdated.
I have lots of gatorade and coconut water on hand and I’ve been able to so far, drink tons of water. I’ve never been pregnant before so for me it’s all new. I’ve already found that blood sugar control varies week to week for me. At weeks 3 & 4 I was running lower, but week 5 I was becoming a bit resistant.

I’ve never been pregnant but my husband and I would like to start trying soon, but I’m unsure if maybe we should wait till all of this calms down some? I have T1D, Hashimoto’s, and asthma, so it’s scary to me even not being pregnant. I know the virus isn’t bad for all, and most cases are mild but I don’t know if the risk is too high to add the pregnancy on top of everything.
I also know that once COVID passes, something else might pop up so I’m wondering if it’s worth waiting after all? I’d just like to hear everyone’s experiences so far! And if you’ve had the virus how was your experience with that as well?
I have read a lot about husbands not being able to go into ultrasound or doctor appointments during this time, and to me that’s heartbreaking. This will be my first pregnancy and I can’t imagine not having my husband with me.

1391,Planning a pregnancy with T1DM and poor control,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Asma,,"Hello everyone,
I don’t know where to begin but here goes.
My blood glucose control has been dodgy at best for years (A1c around 7-9%). I always found a reason to justify it  “medical school, internship,…”. I was never compelled enough to prioritize it over a busy career but that’s what you get for choosing medicine.
I am currently in my residency at a highly demanding program and next year will be (the least consequential) of all.  If I postpone it I’d have to wait until I finish my fellowship (at least three years down the road) and I don’t like my odds that way. This seems as good time as any to start planning a pregnancy.
The thing is, I’ve been negligent for so long I don’t even know how to go about controlling it again. I use an insulin pump but I’m so preoccupied I forget to bolus all the time. I use CGMs occasionally and they seem to help a lot. Though chasing highs is frustrating.
I see others having such incredible numbers and I don’t know how they do it. When do I stop birth control?  Should I wait until it’s a prefect 6%? What if I have fertility issues? Do I become low carb or keto? Do I have to take a year off? (Very detrimental to my training).
Every time I struggle with my diabetes this website came through for me. What I need to hear is words of wisdom. It’d make me less anxious to jot down my plan for next year.",Aug '20
1392,Planning a pregnancy with T1DM and poor control,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Rphil2Type 1 or LADA,3,"Well so first you have to recall that women who have diabetes have been giving birth for many years before A1C, or test strips.  It is true that babies were often oversized and pregnancies more difficult, but still t1d women had children.
So can you have a successful pregnancy, I would say yes.    I think however that you and the baby will have a much better time if you get your blood sugar in the tightest control possible.  Notice I did not say perfect control, but the best you can do.  this will improve your baby and your odds of having the most successful possible.
Use a CGM, if your not on a pump think of getting on one, test, and eat well.  Lose weight, sure, exercise of course, but do not expect that your life will be better in a week or two.  Get a good endocrinologist and CDE who handle diabetes pregnancies.
Finally, I am a male so do not read to much into this, but make sure you really want to do this for the rest of of your life.  Once you have children it will not get easier.

So her life and most of those with diabetes in 1957 was not great.  We can do better.  Your baby deserves the very chance.  You have the tools to do that, if you control your blood sugar.
I was a PWD and I was not Dx’d until 17 years later.  That is because I was in the womb of a woman who was T1 with a largely uncontrolled diabetes.  Me having diabetes had nothing to do with me being in Utero of a mom with diabetes.  That was determined in an instance when I was conceived.

1397,Planning a pregnancy with T1DM and poor control,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Jay6,,"@Asma.  I may be reading too much into this.   I am retired from the health care industry (including Neonatal ICU & EMS).  I wear a pump & CGM.   Think of me as the old starch, combat hardened ICU nurse digesting an intern.  So, if I may be so bold, in your asking for help, are you asking for someone to tell you what to do?  If so:
Rx: Tandem t:Slim X2 with Control-IQ technology.
Rx: Dexcom G6 CGM
The Tandem pump has FDA presets in it.  You will need basals & insulin to carb ratios.  ABOUT THE PUMP: If you BG goes low, the pump decreases basal, even to zero until the CGM reports an improving BG.  Conversely, if your BG is too high, the pump will gradually increase basal insulin and even give modified correction boluses.
The Dexcom G6 sensor life is 10 days (240 hours exactly).  Transmitters last 90 days.
Outcome: Preoccupation is decreased.  Even if you miss a meal bolus, you can catch up when you can.  The pump will try to bring the BG back down.   Integrating the pump & CGM should give you an A1c of about 6.5%
As far as birth control, I believe that question will best be answered by your gyne.  Time off, I have seen many pregnant women actively working in the health care industry as students (medical & nursing - CCs, interns, residents, fellows, & attendings).  Remember pregnancy is not an illness, it is a time to be cherished & lived.
LIke @Rphil2, I, too, am male.  He has given you good, fatherly advise.  I hope I was not too blunt.  I wish you to receive this with the spirit of helpfulness & nursing satire only a hardened resident would understand.   I do remember IDMs (Infants of diabetic mothers).",Aug '20

I actually just got my pump in October 2019 and started with an a1c of 7 but after 3 months of being on my pump and “practicing” for pregnancy my a1c was down into the 5’s and thats when I knew it was safe to start trying for a baby. Sometimes you just need a reason to try harder and for me wanting a baby was that reason. Once you actually get pregnant it just escalates and you work even harder because you know the CGM numbers you are seeing aren’t just for you anymore! The CGM is the biggest life saver though and I doubt I would have had my a1c in the 4’s and 5s throughout pregnancy if I didn’t have it because things change so much from week to week… my endo actually has me upload all of my information from my pump and dexcom every week so she can look at the numbers and help me change them if needed. Its a lot of work but its definitely worth it! Also for reference I have the tandem t:slim x2 and dexcom g6 (the control IQ is life changing),Aug '20
1401,Planning a pregnancy with T1DM and poor control,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Sally7,1,"Sorry it has taken me so long to give some thoughts here. I am trying to reduce news intake so I don’t turn on my tablet as much as I use to and of course my Starbucks is not open to sitting down🙁
I for most of my first 20+ years never had an A1C under 9. Even using a pump, I couldn’t make it happen. Much of it was how much time I wanted to put into it and my job just wasn’t great for diabetes management. Fast food restaurant manager and Starbucks manager.
But when my husband and I finally decided that the time was now, I went to my doctor and we talked about genetics (I didn’t want my kids to have diabetes), and how difficult it was going to be.
So I was using a pump but no CGMS at the time, so it was relearning meal planning, insulin timing, logging everything. A lot of work. But my team Endo, CDE, high risk OB, eye doctor, a whole team helped me get my numbers to a good place and I was given the go ahead to try and get pregnant. My A1C’s were in the mid to upper 6’s. Which I was pretty excited about because as I said I was never that low. And I fortunately for us, it took almost a year to get pregnant. So I was running pretty good numbers for well over 1 1/2 years. Exhausting!
But we did it! And we had a beautiful baby girl who weighed 7 lbs 3 oz and yes was 3 weeks early, so she would have been bigger but completely healthy!
It was exhausting and exhilarating at the same time. And wow, did I test my blood sugars all the time. I think with my Dexcom I could have done much better with numbers but I think of the women who did it with urine testing so each era has its struggles.
Is this the time? Only you and you husband can answer that. Can you get numbers to a place where your team thinks it’s ok, only you and your team can answer that.
You all need to agree on the numbers you need for a successful pregnancy. What numbers I needed are going to be completely different that what you might need.
I will say now with the new insulin pumps and CGM systems out there, this is so much easier. There are some great ones on the market right now. I mean, I think less about my diabetes now, than I did when I was a teenager and never thought about it!
You can do this. It will take some work and maybe some training with a CDE to fine tune things. I did come away with a better understanding of insulin timing and carb counting which has helped me now 28 years later.
So we did try it again. 3 years later we tried again. And unfortunately we lost the second one. I was told by everyone that it was just something that happens. My A1C was better with the second and still a neural tube defect and no hope. It took us another 2 years to try again and happily we had our second child.
It is very doable, no matter where you are currently at. This is a disease that with a little attention you can make some big changes.
So maybe a new CGM/pump system that does things automatically could make things much easier for you. But remember a person with diabetes can have children! If numbers aren’t “perfect”, you can still have a baby. Sure it might be harder on you and the baby and your husband but it can be done. Don’t keep waiting for the perfect number. If we had, I would never have had a child. I don’t think even with my new technology I could get my A1C under a 6.  So shoot for the number you and your team seem as safe enough.

I use MDI and don’t have a CGM, but I test a lot. 8-10 times a day on a normal day, way more if I’m sick or traveling. My insurance won’t cover a pump or CGM, but I’m fine with my current routine, and even when I’m not feeling well I check my BG. Current A1C is 5.6 and I’ve always had pretty good control (under 7 since diagnosis), so my question is, did the hospital allow you control over administering your own insulin and testing your blood sugar? or did you have to give all control to the staff?
It makes me a little nervous handing over control to someone else. I don’t really trust anyone else to control my diabetes. I’ve been in the hospital before and I know how hard it is for someone else to properly dose you, with the right insulin that you currently take, etc. so I would just like to go into it fully prepared (if possible).

However, I can share with a pump and CGM, I was able to send the fingersticks and insulin by nurse packing while I was in hospital twice since 1/1/19.  I was able to us my pump and CGM.
Thoughts.

Would you feel better with a pump and CGM.  An endocrinologist skilled with gestational D can work wonders with skillfully worded letters outlining the cost savings to the insurance company.  Paying for a pump and CGM is much less of a payout than the cost of even one 12 hour ER visit because of a hypo or hyper glycemic misadventure.
Have you been pregnant before?  Points to ponder include how will you body respond to the changing activities of pregnancy?  Will you develop hypo or hyper glycemic unawareness (one of the reasons patients are placed on CGMs)?
Arranging placement of CGM & pump infusion sites with the first twinges of labor would allow you to have good control, especially if the pump has an active feedback system like the Tandem Control IQ system.
Will you be able to stop in the middle of the delivery event to perform a BG test and calculate an insulin does and get it on board?

I am not currently pregnant or TTC but I am planning to within the next year or couple of years. I know a lot goes into planning, etc. and I am a planner at heart, so I wanted to know about lows. I know that your insulin requirements tend to be lower in the first months of pregnancy, but I wanted to know what you all have done who have been pregnant and had morning sickness that caused lows, or just had lows in general. Most of my fear is lows, because I have had times where I fight to keep my BG up, while not pregnant, so any tips and advice would be great!
I already check my BG a lot, so testing isn’t an issue. What are/were your go-tos for lows during sickness, or if you weren’t sick and had lows anyway, how did you ensure that you got your BG up and it stayed up? Thanks all!",Jun '20
1406,Morning Sickness and Low Blood Sugar,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,allisonm,1,"Hey there! I had morning sickness from weeks 4-16. For me, personally, I got a prescription for Reglan from my doctor because I didn’t want to risk a serious low. I thought the benefits of NOT having a low that required assistance far outweighed any potential risks of taking the medication, and there aren’t any known risks. I think there’s a stigma against taking medication during pregnancy which makes women uncomfortable to do so… but I did my research on the risks (once again, no known risks of Reglan specifically) and decided it was right for me.
Otherwise, what you’ll want to do to prevent lows is adjust your insulin dosage. Lower your basal rates, and raise your carb ratios and correction factors so you are getting less insulin. Otherwise, if you are going low, just use something fast acting to treat it like glucose tablets because digestion is slowed during pregnancy and it can take longer to recover as a result. Resist the temptation to overdo your low treatments or you may just bounce back too high, which is frustrating! If you’ve got recurrent lows you can add protein/fat like peanut butter to help keep your sugars up and stable.
Also noteworthy… not everyone gets morning sickness… and not even every diabetic mama has lows in the first trimester. I had some, but not as much as I thought based on what I read. So, everyone is different. The only thing you can plan with certainty about pregnancy and birth is that it’s unpredictable! But so worth it. You’ll be great because you are well-informed.

I got lots of lows the first 20 weeks and then all of a sudden they stopped when baby started getting bigger. Also not everyone gets morning sickness…I was nauseas from weeks 8-16 (horrible) but not vomiting. My OB told me to take vitamin b6 and unisom at night to help relieve it which helped a little… and eating crackers (which also helped keep lows up).

1410,Is it all super stressful? Or was it easy going?,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,daisy707,1,"I wasn’t sure what to title this, but my question to all of you T1D’s who have had successful pregnancies, was it all as stressful as doctors and medical articles say it will be for us T1Ds? Or was it more low key and just normal T1D life but pregnant?
I ask because while I know a T1D pregnancy isn’t like a normal pregnancy because of increased risks and doc visits, I feel like once I start trying for a baby I don’t want to be focusing on all of the stress around it from docs, etc. Of course, I don’t know how it will be or what docs will say because I haven’t spoken to anyone about TTC yet.
I’ve always had a pretty good hang on my control. I’m on MDI, diagnosed 8 yrs ago, and all of my A1C’s have been below 7, mostly around 6. My last one 3 weeks ago was 5.6. I feel like from the get-go I was in tune with my body and determined to stay as healthy as possible. I test 8-10 times a day on a normal day, or more if I’m sick or hormonal. I find that the more I stress out about my numbers, the harder a time I have controlling my BS, so I go with the flow, correct when I need to and move on.
I guess I’m spouting about all of this because I want to know what pregnancy and the experience around planning, etc is really like, and what it was like for you. I really want to focus on the good, and the fact that as a well-controlled T1D I really shouldn’t have any higher risks than a non-diabetic (from what I’ve read). I guess I just want to go into it all with a more positive mindset and be prepared for any negative that might come from doctors. I want to be able to, at the end of the day, trust my gut and my own control over what doctors want from me because I know some are unrealistic. I want to be able to push through any of the bad vibes so I can truly focus on my health and baby’s health.

What you want is a supportive provider who will make you feel at ease. It’s one thing to ensure you are informed on the risks and on how to best take care of yourself. It’s another one entirely for a provider to use scare tactics, pressure you into interventions you aren’t comfortable with, or otherwise increase your stress levels. If you are at uncomfortable with your provider and their wishes for your pregnancy and birth, PLEASE do yourself a favor and seek out another provider. If you have good control as you do, there is no need for them to treat you this way, but some providers might. I switched providers just after my mid-pregnancy anatomy scan and it was the best thing I ever did. I also practiced meditation and use positive affirmations during my pregnancy. Anyway, it is what you make of it. If you engage with stressed people who have had bad experiences, you read about bad experiences, or choose a bad provider, you will likely experience stress. But if you choose to read positive stories, connect with women who have had positive experiences and find a provider who aligns with your beliefs, it will be great. “High risk” pregnancies are beautiful, too.

I feel like how stressful pregnancy will be will depend a lot on your personality and how you currently manage the highs emotionally. For instance, I am very hard on myself and get upset when my blood sugar is high, especially if I wasn’t expecting it. Despite having an a1c in the upper 5s and a decent time in range, I still tend to get upset and stressed when I am high.

I was diagnosed with T1D during my first pregnancy, and thankfully I experienced minimal negativity from my doctors. I think they all realized that I had absolutely no experience with diabetes and I had no idea what I was doing and I was just trying my best. I’m sure it mostly depends on the doctor, but I think some doctors will be more negative and harder on patients they feel aren’t trying to manage their diabetes well (not that I think this is right).

My first recommendation is to try to get a Dexcom ASAP so you are alerted way before you hit such a low number. It can’t be good for you.
Usually you try to stay at higher numbers and not go low and you usually can restore hypo awareness, although not in everyone. For example you try to never go below  a certain number, I’m just not sure what numbers when you are pregnant they want you at.

If you do have one, it should be set to alert you well before getting down to 24mg/dl, at least if it’s a Dexcom. Not as sure about Libre, which you have to “wand” to get your current number, but there are 3rd-party add-ons that allow it to provide trends and alerts like a Dexcom.

I would contact Medtronic and ask them if they have any ideas about why you were not getting the right numbers…In theory you could potentially “reset” your hypoglycemic unawareness but I don’t know that it would be safe to do it pregnancy.   From what I read, you have to have a period of time (believe it varies from person to person) where your blood sugars are always in target and never drop to low or go to high.   In theory, that could reset your sensitivity to the low blood sugars.

Conclusions/interpretation
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IAH develops in people with type 1 diabetes as a habituated response and that introduction of a novel stressor can restore, at least partially, the adapted counterregulatory hormonal, symptoma…

I checked it out of the library. I greatly valued reading the varied experiences of women, including at least one who went 100% natural!
I haven’t had my baby yet (I’m at 28.5 weeks), but here are some thoughts that came to mind…
I think it’s smart to accept that our pregnancies and births might be more medicalized than we’d like, because there is a higher chance of it being necessary and we will have to have an OB. However, we don’t need to accept that it will be medicalized no matter what. It’s so totally wonderful that we have modern medicine to help us if medical intervention really is needed, but it’s not necessary if we don’t need it. Some OB’s have across-the-board policies about mothers with diabetes (many induce early at something like 38 weeks simply based on our diagnosis), but remember that the doctor can’t do anything against your will. The best thing would be to find a doctor who believes in interventions based on signs of need rather than policy. (Like, my OB simply does not induce early unless she sees signs that it’s necessary, and she said that I statistically have a higher chance of a C-section but that I shouldn’t assume that means I’ll have one.) Failing that insist on being a part of the decision making process. (My plan regarding C-section, by the way, is to get a clear explanation of why it’s necessary at that point in time. If it’s medically sound, I’ll say yes. If it’s something like, “This labor has gone on for X amount of hours, and that’s just too long,” I’ll say no.)
I’m planning on a doula, and this doula also happens to be a lay midwife. I really like that extra qualification because I think she can keep me better informed about what’s medically necessary and what’s just the doctor or staff trying to hurry things along. She also gave me a lot of tips about which hospital and which doctors in the area are most natural-friendly. I actually didn’t end up going with any of her recommendations because I already felt that my OB-gyn was going to be great about treating me and my baby, rather than my diagnosis. I’m afraid I can’t speak from experience on helping the doula and the staff work in harmony, but I do plan on telling my doc that I consider her my #1 authority, and that the doula is simply there to support me as I cope. I also plan on telling the doula that I want her to treat the doc the same way, and that if she suspects a problem then she needs to tell me when the doc isn’t there, or give me a signal to say, “May I discuss this alone with my husband for a minute?” Doulas don’t generally get in the doctor’s way (that’s not their role!), but I just think there may be a little increased risk of that happening since my doula has been a midwife for over a decade.

1441,Doulas? Natural Birth?,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Kristin2,,"Hi Andrea,
I am a few weeks away from the birth of our first child – so I can’t share actual experiences yet, but I can completely relate to the emotions that you are feeling.
I was afraid to read up on natural labor or take a natural labor course because I knew that there would be a chance that I can’t have the labor that I want because of diabetes. So I resisted at first, but eventually I read a book about Bradley labor and we took a class that focused on natural labor. I was convinced that this was the type of labor that I wanted and that would be best for our son.
I was pleased to find an OB-GYN who was open-minded. She lets diabetic women carry to full term if there are no complications and prefers vaginal birth to c-section (and her past patients show that). So I felt like I had the best chance of a natural birth that I could hope for!
Fast forward a few months and despite great blood sugars throughout the pregnancy, our son has grown too big and even my OB-GYN is pretty sure that we will need to do a c-section. She is still taking it week by week at this point. I am in my 36th week now and during week 38, she will decide based on his measurements whether we will attempt induced labor or I will have a c-section. The c-section will be no earlier than week 38 and she may decide to wait, if he and my placenta appear to be doing fine. So I don’t have a date set yet and I will hope that we can leave him there, as long as he shows that he is thriving.
A doula is a good option no matter what type of birth experience you will have (even c-section).
I know that disappointment about how the birth happened is not going to help anyone (the baby or me) after the birth. So I am working now on celebrating the fact that my pregnancy has been free of complications and looking forward to the goal: the birth of our son!! Of course, I do wish that the labor would be different and I hate that diabetes had anything to do with the outcome. But my mother’s words have reassured me: she had a natural labor, an induced labor, and a c-section with her three children and she said that each birth felt equally special because of the end result 
Given that our son has macrosomic measurements and his abdomen is measuring larger than his head, I accept that a vaginal birth could be risky for both him and me. So I’m going to trust my doctors opinion. But a large reason that I feel ready to trust her opinion is because I know that she is not just doing a c-section for ease or convenience, but because she has experience and reasons that tell her that it is the safest in our case.
I hope that you are able to find a team that is ready to try natural birth or the most gentle forms of induction first if there are no complications. I think that it is important that you find a team that you trust so that no matter what decisions you and your team face later in the pregnancy, you will have an easier time finding peace with them!
Even with a c-section, we will have our doula there as a lactation consultant.",May '11
1442,Doulas? Natural Birth?,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Marps,,"I’m in the same boat here. I’m at 32 weeks now and have found a OB team that I trust (for the most part). I trust 2 of the 4 doctors. Likely the OB that I see on all my appointments will be the one to deliver my baby. She seems to really care for her patients and she remembers my wishes from week to week so I dont have to forever repeat myself.
My goal is to have a completely natural birth. But, being a brittle type 1 for 13 years, the odds of my placenta making it that far along is unlikely. I’ve come to terms with needing Pitocin to get labor started. They dont do it in one shot- it’s an IV of Pitocin that will begin my contractions and hopefully my body will be able to continue from there. I was adament in all of my visits that there is no discussion of c-section. I have such a hard time healing from even minor wounds (often get infected), that I can’t even imagine what it’ll be like to heal from something so invasive like a c-section. If it comes to that, I’m sure that I will have a mental breakdown. I mean, I want my baby to be safe and healthy… but if I’m recovering from a huge surgery like that, how will I be able to bond with her? I’m really afraid of this.
I’ve written out my birth plan and given it to my Endo, my OB team and the hospital. I will not be using a duola because my doctors all understand what I am wishing for during the birth process. My husband is very supportive. I’m the type of person who will shout if I feel the nurses / docs aren’t listening to my needs. I dont feel there is a need for me to use a duola.

1443,Doulas? Natural Birth?,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,E_Louise,,"Hi Andrea,
I’m also only 16 weeks along, but have been thinking about these issues for awhile now. It is hard to accept that diabetes might mean you have to have a different kind of birth experience than you might otherwise choose. At this point, I’m trying to think positively about it and know that a) who knows, I might get to have a natural or mostly natural experience and b) as long as the experience is overall a good one and I feel that I am well taken care of and well informed, and that I feel that my OB is doing what’s best for the baby and for me, then it will be great.
I am going to a high-risk OB practice at a very well-respected teaching hospital. There is a midwifery practice in the same office. I have the benefit of knowing one of the nurses who works on the Labor and Delivery unit there, and I had a long talk with her about what to expect. She told me that some of the high-risk OBs are willing to let their patients be “co-managed” by a midwife. She also told me that there was a high likelihood that I would be delivered by a resident, which is not something I’m okay with (I know that nurses and doctors have to learn somehow, but I’ve seen enough blunders by new doctors and nurses that that scares me!) She said that if I were co-managed by a midwife, the midwife on call would be the one to deliver me, unless there were complications, in which case it would most likely not be a resident.
So that is a long-winded way of saying that perhaps you could ask your OB if this is possible at your hospital. My OB said yes as long as things are going well and there are no complications. So we’ll see what actually happens.  But maybe that’s a possibility for you?
From what I’ve heard, doulas are great. I’ve never heard anyone regret having a doula. My brother and sister-in-law had one even with a c-section, and they loved her. Around here, you can get one for free–one of the nursing schools has trained volunteer doulas.

1445,Doulas? Natural Birth?,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Lisa_L,,"In my opinion, you need a doula. Especially with type 1 pregnancies and the urging of labor staff for medical intervention. You don’t know what you don’t know, especially the first time around.
For the birth of my daughter just over 3 years ago, we stressed our desires for no c-section, as few meds as possible and alternative laboring positions. What we got was my water broke at 34.5 weeks, doctors induced right away with Pitocin, although I could have waited as much as 12 hours to see if labor would start naturally. The Pitocin, along with all the fetal monitoring, meant I labored on my back and the contractions were a lot stronger than I bargained for. I opted for a epidural based on the pain levels and ended up pushing for 3 hours, resulting in uterine/vaginal trauma since my daughter was turned sideways throughout labor.
After a brief photo op holding her, she was then whisked away for testing and to be put in an incubator and I wasn’t allowed to see her again or nurse her for 3 hours. That was probably the most awful part.
I feel that a lot of this could have been avoided if we had a doula, who had been through it all many time before and acted as an advocate for our desires. We really didn’t know some of the questions to ask or what to fight for during that time of stress.
I am now TTC while living in Argentina and have already contacted a doula organization to find hospitals more open to natural births (although all births are more natural here - epidurals are somewhat rare and have to be ordered ahead of time) and there is no way I am having another baby, especially in a new environment without a doula!!

My wonderful partner and I just officially found out earlier today that we are pregnant! We haven’t even told our family and friends yet so you all are the first to know 
To give you a little background, I’m 24 years old approximately 4 weeks pregnant (unplanned).  I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when I was just 18 months old. As a child my sugars were pretty well controlled (A1C’s in the 5’s and 6’s) then as I progressed into my teens, they just got worse. Eventually, not checking my sugars and not giving myself insulin became a bad habit that was really tough to break. I’ve been in the ICU twice around my late teens for DKA. It got a little better when I got my pump around 2013 but my bad eating habits and not checking my sugars stuck around. Haven’t even seen an endocrinologist since last year due to insurance issues and my A1C was 10.3.
When I realized my cycle was 3 days late and I could possibly be pregnant (about a week ago), I’ve been checking my sugars frequently but it’s been really hard stabilizing them between 70-120. My whole life I’ve been told how difficult it would be to safely deliver a healthy baby. I’ve encountered MANY doctors and nurses through the years who have scolded me and judged me, but not anyone who could really understand and help me through these challenges. I don’t personally know anyone else with Type 1, especially someone who was diagnosed as early as me so I’m here today, looking for some guidance from people sharing similar experiences.
Would anyone be so kind as to share some insight into their experience with Type 1 DM and pregnancy? I’m trying, I’m terrified, and I have no one else to really talk to about this besides my partner but he isn’t diabetic. Can I give birth to a healthy baby and survive it?",Mar '18

If you are still having insurance issues you can get your A1C done at most community clinics for a very reasonable cash price (for me paying up front it’s about $25) and you probably really need to talk to a Dr. about your diabetes combined with your pregnancy.
I was diagnosed at 18 months as well and had poor control for most of my life and only recently managed to get my A1C under 7. Low carb combined with a CGM is what finally gave me the edge I needed to get there. Low carb will take away most of the spikes that as far as I know are the real danger with pregnancy, and do not beat yourself up every time you have a bad BG because that won’t help you or your baby.
Let us know if there is anything specific you are having trouble with and we’ll all see what we can come up with.",Mar '18
1450,First Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,CEMedz,,"Thank you so much for your response! I will absolutely inquire about a CGM at my Dr.'s appointment in 2 days. A low carb diet sounds like a good solution for most of my spikes and increased insulin intake. I know I’ll have to see a registered dietitian as well for more help with carb counting.
About 2-3 times a week I’ve gotten really low where I start shaking, sweating, and just eat everything in sight until I start to feel better. After that, my sugar spikes again because I’m not sure how to treat the low/horrible feeling without overeating. Then I get too afraid to give myself a bolus for the food I ate because of the recent low. How do you usually treat your lows when they happen?",Mar '18
1451,First Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Firenza,,"Are you testing your BG when you start feeling low? How low are you going? Is it possible that your basal rate is set too high? Pregnancy hormones will throw everything for a loop so you’ll probably have to adjust your basal and bolus regimen quite a few times throughout your pregnancy.
Treating the low should be pretty easy but getting rid of that horrible feeling for me just takes time and patience (unfortunately). I use glucose tablets which are absorbed by our bodies much faster than most other “low treatments” and you are not as likely to overindulge on those as you would with juice or candy. 1 gram of glucose should raise your BG by about 5 mg/dl so if the appropriate amount of glucose doesn’t get your BG back in range then you are probably dealing with a basal rate issue.
Until you figure out what the problem is then I would make sure to eat plenty of protein to help carry you over when all of the carbs have processed. If you are not having morning sickness yet then you may want to do a basal test to see if your basal rate is set too high.
As for carb counting get a scale and weigh everything and use an app like OneDrop or something to track calories, BG’s, insulin, and carbs. If you can, cook your own food for a while so that you know exactly what you are eating and can bolus for it correctly.",Mar '18
1452,First Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Cinderfella,2,"I have had two healthy children.  They are 24 and 26 years old.  So it is totally possible for you to give birth to a healthy baby.   I want to be honest though.  I did also have one uncuvcessful pregnancy that ended in stillbirth.   I don’t know what happened to that baby.  I never got any definite answers.
I wasn’t in the best control either when I started out but I got in control pretty quick.  Not many people had pumps back then.  I didn’t have one.  I had never heard of a CGM either.  I checked my blood sugar 7 times a day and took more and more insulin with each passing week.
Having a baby as a diabetic is not the blissful picture of the expectant mom with her hand rubbing her tummy.   It’s a lot of hard work and a 24 hour a day job.   Oh, and worry.  Lots of worry.
It’s worth it!!  It’s totally worth it once you have your baby in hand.   Your diabetes will return to a normal level.  It might be a new normal but your insulin will level off and become more manageable.  You may even adopt some better habits while you are pregnant.   You want to be in good shape to live long and take care of your child so 10.3 won’t cut it any more.
The whole thing is scary, I know.  You need a high risk OB/GYN and a Hospital with NICU.  You’ll most likely find both of those in or near a large city.  I had to travel to see my dr which required some over night stays.
Best of luck with it.  So much new technology since I was having babies.  We are here if you need us.",Mar '18
1453,First Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Lcpgh,,"Hi there!
I have not yet given birth, but I am 28 weeks pregnant with type 1 so thought my experience thus far might be somewhat useful to you!  I have been type 1 for 18 years and didn’t experience great control until the last few years.  I completely credit my Dexcom CGM for that.  My a1c at conception was 5.4 and since then it has been 5.1, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2, and 4.9.  The insulin resistance has gotten CRAZY over the last few weeks.  I’m now using almost 3 times the insulin as I used pre-pregnancy (in my Tandem T slim pump).
I see my endocrinologist once a month and have seen the high risk OB (MFM) a few times.  I am about to see them weekly for growth scans to make sure he’s not getting too huge!  The MFM put me on baby aspirin once a day to strengthen my placenta and prevent preeclampsia, but other than that he hasn’t had much to say.
I am also about to start weekly NST’s later this week.  They also sent me for a fetal echocardiogram last week but it was totally normal.
I think the most frustrating thing is just the pressure - you feel like if you make a mistake you are hurting your baby.  But we can only do the best we can!  I asked my OB, “Should I call you if I have one really high blood sugar?” and she literally laughed at me and said, “a high blood sugar here and there is not going to hurt anything.”
Insulin resistance is also rather frustrating.  For me, I have NOT been able to go low carb at all.  I have had terrible morning sickness and am still throwing up almost every day.  The doctor says it’s from the diabetes combining with the pregnancy hormones to create severe gastroparesis.  Unfortunately, I HAVE to eat bland carbs every few hours or I become violently ill.  Again, we just do the best we can!
At this point (depending what happens with the NST’s and growth scans) the plan is to try to be induced at 39 weeks exactly.  That’s the goal.  If they find that he is going to be abnormally huge, then we will schedule a c-section, but I am hoping to avoid that.
Sorry to just ramble on!  I’m happy to answer any questions you have.  YOU CAN DO THIS!!!",Mar '18
1454,First Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,CEMedz,,"My low’s have run between 38-78 (78 is probably an optimal number but around then is when I start feeling the symptoms). I have an endocrinologist appointment in 2 days so I’m thinking she might adjust my basal rate to increase/decrease at different times of the day. For example, I’ve noticed my BG increases between the hours of 4 am-7-am even when I’ve eaten nothing.
Another issue I have is that I work full time night shift 8 hours/5 days a week. Before I got pregnant, my endocrinologist has said that that shift isn’t recommended for me as it can really mess with my sugars - and now that I’m testing more often, I’ve noticed it too!
Thanks so much for the advice! Definitely taking all of this into account.",Mar '18

I do consider myself very lucky to have all of this new technology available to me living with diabetes, especially now that I’m pregnant. So I salute you for being in such control and bringing 2 healthy babies into the world even without pumps, CGM’s, or health apps! I’ll get anything I can to help with this pregnancy.
We also live in Chicago so we’re very fortunate to be surrounded by great hospitals! Just had an appointment with my midwife today and she faxed over a referral for a high risk OB/GYN that I did some research on prior to choosing.
Before I met my partner, I always thought that if I met the right person and I were to give him children, THAT would be the thing that saves my life. Living with diabetes your whole life and comparing yourself to people without it really took a toll on my self-care, especially when I was a teenager. Those bad habits just carried on into adulthood. I had no discipline and no motivation to better care for myself.
Now, I’ll do anything and everything to make sure this baby and I are healthy. You’re so right, what I was doing before isn’t going to cut it at all. I want nothing more than to give my soon-to-be husband healthy children and I want to be around to love them all for as long as I possibly can.",Mar '18

I have my first endocrinologist appt in 2 days so I’m definitely going to inquire about getting a CGM because my numbers fluctuate so much throughout the day. I have a Medtronic Minimed pump right now and it’s helped so much with giving myself insulin because I really hated sticking myself 6 times a day in the past. I’d like to have something that catches my high/low BG levels before they start getting too extreme though!
Yes you’re so right about the pressure. Whenever I have a high reading I just get so worried.
Wow, I can’t believe you’re using 3 times the insulin you used pre-pregnancy. I get worried when I have to use more than 10 units  What kinds of foods do you usually eat to address the morning sickness??

1458,First Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Cinderfella,2,"Feel free to ask me anything.  I’m happy to share my experiences.   If it will help someone else, then all the better.
Yes, it was my first baby that was lost, my only boy.  I carried him eight months.   He had been a very active baby but one day I noticed that he had stopped kicking.   I called my local dr (not even the high risk one).   I went in to see the local dr.  No heart beat.  Nothing.  I was induced and delivered in the wee hours of the next morning.
We had that baby examined post mortem.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with him.   My A1c throughout the pregnancy was down around 6.   We never got any definitive answers as to what went wrong.
I’m not telling you all this to scare you.  I’m just being honest.   The good news in all this was that my oldest daughter was born a year and two days later.  She is now 26.  With her, and my second daughter, I went into the hospital in the 8th month and sat there for several weeks waiting for them both to be born. I was strapped to the fetal monitor four times a day, every day.  As soon as their lungs were mature, they were out.  They were both incubated a few days and both went under the “billy” lights.  Other than that, they were, and are, both fine.   My youngest daughter is 24.
It’s too bad we lost our only boy but we didn’t give up or take no for an answer.  We kept going until we got what we wanted, which was two healthy children.   After that I was done, tubes tied, factory closed.  I couldn’t put us all through that again.  No regrets.
It was wonderful to give birth to my own children.  No one should be cheated out of the experience because of diabetes.  You can do it.
Again, don’t be scared because of my personal story of loss.  Stuff happens whether you have diabetes or not.   My story has a happy ending.
Best of luck.",Mar '18
1459,First Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Lcpgh,,"Thank you!!
Yeah the CGM is so great for alerting BEFORE anything bad happens.  I have it set really sensitively so I can catch any problems before they come up.  Definitely a game changer.
Unfortunately, the only foods I have found that really help the morning sickness are things like white bread and crackers.  Basically the opposite of what I would ideally like to be eating.  BUT even with all of those foods my a1c is still 4.9, so I hope that makes you optimistic!
I don’t have a monitor at home.  Now that I’m far enough along to feel him move all the time (he’s VERY active), that gives me all of the reassurance I need.
I had an OB appointment this morning and since they don’t have any concerns at this point they are letting me wait until week 32 to start my NSTs, instead of starting this week at 28 weeks.  I will be getting a growth scan next week so cross your fingers that he’s not a huge monster baby haha!

1460,First Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,CEMedz,,"So just had my endo appt on Friday… some good news!
My A1C went down from 10.3 to 7.8 since my last visit. Still some work to do but I’m confident I can get it down some more! My endocrinologist slightly increased my basal rate on my pump too. She also changed the bolus ratio from 1:6 to 1:7. Honestly since then my sugars haven’t been as low as I’d like them to be (mostly around the 130’s-180’s) but I think that has more to do with my current diet. That’s my biggest challenge right now.
I also spoke with a diabetes educator about getting a CGM so she’s put in a referral for me and hopefully I’ll have one within the next month.
Just had our first ultrasound earlier today and we saw the baby’s heart beating  sorta looked like if you flicked a bean sprout over and over again lol. Anyway, seeing it just made it even more real and gave me even more motivation to better care for us.

1466,First Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,KCCO,,"@CEMedz congrats on your pregnancy! I am almost 18 weeks along myself and just wanted to share how its been for me.
First trimester you tend to run low, and I did. My a1c before pregnancy was in the 6’s but during my first trimester it dropped to the lowest I’ve ever seen it - 5.8 and then 5.4. The thing is, I could never FEEL my lows anymore! I use a Dexcom and I think it was struggling to keep up with me. It would alert that I was at 70, but when I would check on my meter, I’d already be in the 50s and not feel a thing. That definitely threw me for a loop and I started carrying all natural fruit snacks in my purse (they’re lighter weight than juice boxes and I absolutely HATE glucose tabs!) and keeping juce boxes everywhere else - car, coffee table, kitchen, office, bedside table.
Thankfully I never had bad nausea, just low-grade stuff, and I never got sick. Sometimes I would have weird moments of “am I nauseated or am I hungry…hmm” which is definitely a strange feeling! Usually it was hunger!
I’ve been trying to eat low carb/keto and before I got pregnant I did really well, even through the first trimester I did really well and hadn’t gained a pound (this girlfriend doesn’t need to gain ANY weight, baby can have ALL my fat reserves, lol).
Second trimester now and things are haywire. I’m up to 1:3 carb ratio most of the day. I went from bolusing like, 4 units for breakfast of coffee, a few spoonfuls of peanut butter, and a few bites of cottage cheese, to bolusing 15 or more for the same meal. It honestly freaks me out and I’m worried my a1c will have jumped way too high at my next endo appointment on Tuesday. And of course I have to see a strange doctor I never met before instead of the PA I’ve been working with for years…not bitter about that at all.
I was ridiculous about my diabetes control when I went to college. I basically did my basal shot at night, but never bolused or checked my blood sugar. So many nights spent binging with the girls on raw cookie dough, I literally have no idea how I survived. Then after college of course it was a struggle to get back into good habits. It wasn’t until we got married (Nov 2011) that my husband gave me the guilt trip talk and told me he wanted me to take care of myself so I could be with him for a long, long time. Of course that got me back on track. I wasn’t super strict, but I tried a lot harder. Then in April 2013 irony of ironies, I went into dka after a bit too much to eat at a friend’s wedding shower. I had no idea what dka was supposed to feel or be like, so my blood sugar was off the charts by the time we made it to the ER and they were able to triage me. I was in ICU for 2-3 days before they put me in a regular room for observation one more night and then I was released. No one at that hospital had any idea about new analog insulins or basal and bolus rates or pumps or cgms. I was still cruising in the 200s when they finally released me. So it was a learning experience for sure, and the only time I’ve ever been admitted to the hospital! My poor husband was so traumatized that he didn’t want me to get pregnant for years.
Finally we were both ready for kids, but I think we’re both a little spooked about being in the hospital and under a doctor’s care who knows nothing about my daily t1d management. I’m ready to fight for what I need, and we’ll be hiring an experienced doula to help us out as well.
I’d love to hear how you’re doing!",Apr '18
1467,First Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,CEMedz,,"@KCCO Congrats on your pregnancy as well! It sounds like you’re taking such good care of yourself now! Which is saying a whole lot because of the bad habits you came from in college, which I’m actually still trying to break now 
I’m currently in my first trimester. They tested my A1C about 2-3 weeks ago when I confirmed my pregnancy and it was 7.8…which is actually a huge improvement from the 10.3 I tested at about 6 months ago at the last endo appt I attended due to insurance changes. Right now my BG levels are ALL over the place. Throughout the day, I run from as low as 47 to as high as 240’s. My diet is the biggest factor affecting my sugars. I’m always craving fast food and when I’m not, my home cooked meals are loaded with carbs, particularly white rice. I also work 11 pm-730 am about 5 nights/week so my basal rates vary from hour to hour. My boluses for meals are usually always around 12-20 units now, which is scary because I know my insulin resistance is going to increase further into my pregnancy!
I just got my CGM and new Medtronic pump in the mail yesterday so I’m supposed to attend a class on 4/23 to adjust to the new tech. So hopefully that’ll help keep my BGs down and more stable, definitely including a change in diet. I’m so terrified because I’ve read that the first 8-12 weeks of your pregnancy are the most crucial time for the baby’s development and my sugars are out of control.
I’ve been having a ton of nausea and I’ve been getting carsick if I’m not the one driving. My OB prescribed some Diclegis, which is supposed to be safe for  mother/baby to address the nausea. I’ve been taking it as needed. Plus some diet ginger ale from time to time. But I definitely know what you mean about those weird moments where you don’t know if you’re nauseated or just hungry! I feel like being hungry makes the nausea worse actually. And I’ve read that skipping meals can make you feel more sick.
 It’s so nice to hear your story about your habits in college and how it all changed when you met your husband. I feel like our stories are very similar! I almost never checked my BGs and only bolused with my pump for carbs I ate, but even then I would under bolus because I hated how low BGs felt. I’ve been in DKA twice at 13 and 19 years old. It wasn’t until I started dating my fiance that I really felt the need to take better care of myself. Before him, I sort of hid and ignored the fact that I had T1D so in turn, none of the people I dated or any of my friends were really concerned about it because I looked fine. So it was such an eye opener when I finally had someone that wanted me to be as healthy as possible so I could be with them for the long run. And now that we’re expecting our first baby, my eyes are as open as ever! Lol.
This was an unplanned pregnancy as I would’ve liked to have my blood sugars under better control before conceiving. But now I’m willing to do whatever it takes to keep my baby healthy, safe, and free from anything that might cause him/her any pain or distress in the future. I’m so scared though! And the worry never goes away!
What do you usually eat for your low carb/keto diet? I need to make some big changes in my eating habits. Sorry this was so long haha, but thanks for sharing!",Apr '18

Good for you for the great A1C!  I highly recommend a book called “Pregnancy with Type 1 Diabetes: Your Month-to-Month Guide to Blood Sugar Management”
by Ginger Vieira & Jennifer Smith CDE.
Amazon Link here 14
Written by two Type 1 Diabetic moms who have had babies of their own.
I am a T1 about 5.5 weeks along w/ my first pregnancy. October is due month! I am 29 years old and was diagnosed w/ T1 at 4 years, so I have about 25 years of Diabetes behind me. I am thankful that my BGs have been very good! I am always aiming for the perfect 85, but my normal range is 70-100. For normal, healthy pregnant ladies, normal blood sugar is 60-120.  I have gotten down to 57 and up to 180 once : ( right after I found out I was pregnant. But, my numbers are great MOST of the time!
I have not gotten hooked up with an OB yet, (I moved to the area recently and got married). But, I am going to do my best to have a natural birth at a birthing center - managing my own glucose levels for sure - there’s no way I’m giving that away during labor!! I have my first consultation w/ a midwife this Monday.
I would love to hear how your doing and to compare experiences with you!
So far, the main thing I’ve noticed is being extra hungry - I now need 2 eggs every morning fried w/ grass-fed gee and mushrooms, a slice of sprouted bread toast  spread with coconut oil and a 1/2 cup of goat milk kefir, slice of cheese… Lol! PLUS my vitamins, probiotics, cod liver oil and now Psyllium Husk to keep my bowels moving… 
Are you on a pump and cgm?
I am on the Medtronic 670G and Guardian Sensor 3 cgm - but only since October 2018.
I also recently found out that T1 moms need to be taking 2000 mcg of Folic Acid every day - not just the recommended 400! And if you have the MTHFR gene, you need to be taking the L-methylfolate kind so you body can absorb it. I have no idea if I have the gene. I get about 1000mcg of folic acid w/ my prenatal and b-complex, and 1000mcg of L-methylfolate.

1490,I’m pregnant!,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,BeckyZ,6,"Hi, vsylvia, welcome!
I actually put a lot of work in to get ready for this pregnancy. I started in December of 2017 taking steps to get a better hba1c and get all my doctors on board. I started at a 7.2, then down to 7.0, then down to 6.7, and finally got it to a 5.6 last August, which is when we started trying.
The hardest part, in my opinion, is the mental and emotional aspects. It can get very lonely, which is why it was so helpful to have this community to vent to. I wouldn’t talk about it to non-diabetics because they tended to be unintentionally hurtful, like telling me to just not get pregnant, or that i just had to be more strict with my diet and it would be easy, or suggesting that herbal supplements could cure me of my diabetes, lol. Having a group who gets it is amazing!
I would also recommend talking to your doctors early. My gynecologist was honest that she did not feel capable of dealing with a pregnant diabetic, so I started going to a high risk obstetric group who gave me more detailed advice and expectations for going forward with the pregnancy.

I have spoken with my nephrologist about possibly trying to conceive the end of this year. She told me that she recommended that I go to a high risk doctor right off the bat (and also that my kidneys are more than healthy for that). I have been researching a few and I think my husband and I might schedule a visit this summer to speak with one.
One concern I did have was that my endocrinologist was saying I could have a healthy baby right now and my A1C is 7.5. While that isn’t out of control per say, and I do trust and like my endocrinologist, everything I have personally researched says A1C as close to 6 as possible.

1496,Thinking about number 2,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Jenna2,1,"Hello!
I am 32 years old and have a beautiful, healthy almost 3 year old. She was thoroughly planned due to my type 1 diabetes, and I was able to control my blood sugars throughout the pregnancy. Though my doctors have no concerns about a second pregnancy, my husband and I always figured we would have the one child, because of how difficult the pregnancy was. I suffered from a lot of anxiety (typical for type 1 mothers I’m sure).
Recently, I have started to feel the desire to give my child a sibling. My husband feels the same, though has reservations because he knows how hard on me the first pregnancy was. The first time around, it was hard, but I knew without a doubt what we wanted (to be parents). This time around, although I should have the assurance that I was able to do it once before, I’m finding the decision more difficult. I don’t NEED another child to feel fulfilled with our family, but I do think another would be wonderful.
I worry about handling being pregnant, and stalking my blood sugars, while working and caring for a preschooler. If I could skip the pregnancy and have a healthy baby at the end of it (or if diabetes weren’t in the equation) I would do it in a heartbeat. I envy my friends who don’t give a second thought to the pregnancy and just have to decide how big of a family they want. Anyone go through something similar or have a story to share?",Jan '20

When my wife and I were married I insisted that if we were to have a child we were to have two.  It was a tough decision by then I was T1 and I was not certain I wanted any.
Once we decided to have a child we had did have two.  It was difficult, but once we decided to have children I have never regretted the decision.  So I have no direct experience, but I can say that we do love our sons now 37 and 40.

I’ve also been diagnosed with hashimoto’s hypothyroidism and while it isn’t really causing me issues now, I’m worried about how that will be affected by pregnancy as well.
My husband is much more concerned about me being pregnant again and would be interested in adopting but I just don’t think it’s right for me.

You are 32, peak fertility, what better time to give your child a sibling if not now?  I had toxemia both pregnancies, but second pregnancy was so much easier than the first that I was able to be delivered by a midwife VBAC (I know they don’t do that now) and recovery was so much easier. You will only be pregnant for nine months.  I found actually the hardest part (except for first child with the toxemia and the emergency C. section) to be getting used to the erratic sleep cycles of newborns and getting enough sleep.
I would say control your diabetes as best you can and go for it.  And get a lot of support from family, friends, relatives, etc.  If you have the money, hire a doula or someone to help you during those first three months after the baby is born.  I did not breastfeed either kid; too much for me.  I think you have to take care of yourself in order to be able to take great care of your kids.

I’m 37, type 2 for 7 years, and is 9 weeks pregnant.  I didn’t take a test till 30 days after my missed period because I was on levothyroxine and was told that it may stop your period by friends of mine who have under active thyroid.  When I found out I was actually pregnant, I got really sad because now the doctors are going to tell me all the horrible things that can/or will happen for being a t2 mother and being 37 with my first child.  I am on insulin now.  For a year I was on victoza to help me lose weight (which I did) and get off of insulin.  But I’m back on it now.  All the literature that the nurses gave me includes a diet plan because I am diabetic.  I just find it really restrictive.  1/2 cup of oatmeal, 6 crackers, etc,  I’m still starving!!!  I can’t have too much cheese because I also have high triglycerides but they tell me to have more cheese.  I drink tons of water but my stomach can’t handle anymore liquid.  At my conformation appointment, the nurse looked at me really grim and said “Since you are high risk you are prone to miscarriage” and went off on all the things that can/or will happen if I don’t get my sugars under control.  (They are btw. I just started insulin 5 days ago)  The diabetes program that I didn’t ask to be in are asking for numbers that can’t be above 120.  Last I checked, hormones can mess up everything and more insulin is needed.  More insulin, more hungry.  Especially if you’re pregnant.  I am very frustrated.  I would have felt better if the nurse just told me to abort because I am too high risk.

Are your Dr.s saying to avoid cheese right now or was that before your pregnancy? Pregnancy changes Dr.s opinions about a lot of things that they may have been worried about before.",Dec '18
1508,"Type 2, 9 weeks pregnant, diet plan too restrictive",Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,lumi73,5,"7 years ago I was you, except I was 16 weeks along when I found out. To be fair, I underwent major surgery about two months prior to conceiving and everything was out of whack.
I’m sorry the nurse was rude to you. Unfortunately it’s not uncommon and you will get the horror speeches throughout pregnancy since you are diabetic and 37. I hated my first clinic so I switched at 24 weeks and the doctor and staff were much better. Always remember that you are an integral member of your health care time and are worthy of dignity and respect.
Most diabetic eating plans offered by your clinician often leave much to be desired for and sometimes inappropriate. You’ll be most successful with high protein, low/complex carb choices. Carbs aren’t a definitive no but choose them wisely to help minimize wide swings in your blood sugar. Here’s the gist of what I ate during pregnancy:
Breakfast: eggs made all kinds of ways-omelettes were my favorite, sometimes bacon or sausage, unsweetened Greek yogurt with 1/4 fresh or frozen berries. Occasionally I’d have some fried potatoes or whole wheat toast. For the most part I avoided cold cereal or oatmeal because it would spike my blood sugar.
Lunch: Sandwich using light bread or sandwich thins, plenty of turkey or ham, slice of real cheese, maybe a half of small apple or orange or a handful of grapes. I’d also make a nice salad making sure it had chicken, hard boiled egg, cheese and other veggies-just be mindful of salad dressings as many have added sugar.
Dinner: grilled meat and vegetables. If the weather was nice it was done on the barbecue otherwise in a grill pan on the stove. Pretty much any kind of non-starchy vegetable was fair game whether it was raw, cooked, or a salad.
Snacks: nuts, cubed cheese, jerky, peanut butter or hummus with carrots or celery, hard boiled egg, unsweetened Greek yogurt or skyr, cubed melon, berries, a few triscuit crackers, a cup of popcorn, sugar free jello or pudding cup when I was desperate for something sweet.
Try to eat at relatively the same time each day, get plenty of rest, stay hydrated. Get an app like mySugr so you can log your blood sugar readings, insulin doses, and meals so you can more readily identify patterns and which foods might give you problems.
I made it to 40 weeks, 2 days and had a healthy 7lb, 2oz baby girl with zero complications for either of us. She turns 7 next month. My A1C at the end of pregnancy was 5.4!

1510,"Type 2, 9 weeks pregnant, diet plan too restrictive",Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Dessito,,"Very good advice all and especially worthwhile as it comes from a person with similar experience as OP.
@anon39898571 - the only additional thing I’d say is get really comfortable with adjusting your own insulin rates. More insulin does not make you more hungry by the way, not sure why you feel that. I understand you just started on it and it will take some time, but read “Thinking Like a Pancreas” and “Sugarsurfing” which should help to get you up to speed quickly. (There might be T2-specific titles I am not familiar with as well, but these are helpful for anyone who uses insulin.) And also try to factor in some exercise especially if you can do it after meals. It does wonders for the BG and in general is good for you and baby.
Sticking to the really tight ranges is a goal you should aim for and correct, correct, correct when you don’t manage. Yes, with the pregnancy hormones everything will need constant adjustment but that’s exactly why you want to be comfortable knowing what to do.
There are also a couple of books about being pregnant with diabetes, you may want to start with this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049ENHQM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1 6.

When I reach that point who knows? I have a Dexcom now so it will be easier in the future hopefully!
But I think a doctor might be able to tell you what level is safer for your pregnancy or what you need to aim for while pregnant. They want you to stay safe, but too high isn’t good either.

Thank you, i feel like i went from barely pre diabetic to full blown in under a week. Also thank you so much for your confidence i hope to get there soon.

1532,"Newly pregnant, sick with bronchitis, panicking about highs: am I over-reacting?",Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Bunnii,1,"It also seems like those numbers aren’t bad at all and definitely 2 days of numbers like that are likely just fine, especially if your fasting numbers are lower.
I think your idea just eating what is comfortable instead of trying to reach a carb count makes a lot of sense given that you’re only on a long acting insulin. If you start to drop too far you can definitely take some quick glucose. For me, I would rather treat a low with some honey (if you don’t know to do this already, make sure you have something for lows on hand at all times since you’re on insulin now!) than have highs that are long lasting. This is probably not the safest mentality for most people but I know my body and how I respond really well - I’ve been doing this myself for a quarter century!

A high blood sugar is not a huge deal, it is really prolonged highs that are an issue.
I do believe an appointment with your doctor and CDE is in order to find out what your treatment plan should be for those excursions out of range. They are your medical team and you should never feel like you are a burden calling them. That is their job to be there when you have questions or issues!

Do you happen to know what qualifies as a sustained high? It seems weird that this information does not seem to exist anywhere! I can imagine people not wanting to encourage people to allow highs at all but that information would really help a lot of expectant mothers relax which also helps with blood sugar control! I don’t think it’s appropriate to call an on-call doctor after hours to ask that question because regardless of the answer, what I do in response to a high does not change (get it down!)

1538,"Type 2, Newly Pregnant, High-ish BG",Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,fillefantome,,"Hi, I’m type 2, 5 weeks pregnant. I started Levemir a little over a year ago, in order to get my 7.2 A1C down for IVF treatment. I had been well-controlled with Metformin until about a year before that when I was laid off and gained a bunch of weight (diagnosed in 2010). Since getting up to a stable dose of Levemir a year ago (100 units split between bedtime and morning), my fasting blood sugar has been in the 95-110 range most days, with the occasional weird blip up to ~120. (My post-meal numbers have often ranged around 160, depending on what I ate/time of day.)
The day that babe likely implanted (I got a positive pregnancy test a couple days later), my blood sugar went totally wonky–144 fasting, with a pre-lunch low of 126 and all my other tests that day in line with my fasting (1, 2, and 4 hours after a pretty normal lunch all in the 150s–usually by 4 hours later I’m down to ~100). The next day, I went up to 120 units of Levemir and my numbers have been better (fasting 115-120), but still higher than they should be–I’m continuing to up this number slowly until either I get the fasting numbers I want or my bg starts to go low (I usually don’t get lows, but I know that 1st trimester can be a time for them). And my post-meal numbers are too high, and I know that I probably need to go seriously low-carb to control them, but I’m starting to feel some morning sickness and all the foods that are supposed to be good for morning sickness are terrible for diabetes. I’m wondering if maybe I should be starting meal-time insulin to control post-meal spikes, but, honestly, my primary care doctor just gave me the Levemir Rx, told me to titrate up slowly, and gives me refills when I ask for them (it was my idea to start insulin). I know that my ob/gyn or an MFM will likely have BG goals for me and may want to see my logs, etc., but I’m not expecting my fertility clinic to refer me to an ob/gyn until 8weeks, and I’m not sure if I should be worried about what effects this will all have on the baby, if I wait until then to talk to a doctor about this stuff.",Dec '18

1542,Blood Sugars in Early Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,t3db,,"Hello all.  My wife (T1) and I recently found out we are pregnant and are just beginning week 5.  Similar to what many people have experienced, we found that right before getting the positive pregnancy test (at week 4) and the following week her blood sugars were running much higher than usual.  We had to increase her Basal by a lot to avoid the high spikes (particularly in mid-morning).
However, today it looks like her blood sugar is running much lower than the previous few days, and she seems to keep going low, even after eating some candy.  I know that most T1 pregnant women find that their insulin requirements decrease in the first trimester, but based on what I have found we shouldn’t expect this until around week 8 or so.
Has anyone else also experienced an increase in insulin requirements in early pregnancy (weeks 3-5) to then suddenly finding their needs decrease?  We have been making a lot of adjustments to her Basal, so its possible we got too aggressive, although the neurotic side of me is of course worried there is an issue with the pregnancy.",Jan '19
1543,Blood Sugars in Early Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Diabetes and Pregnancy,Dessito,2,"While there are general trends in BG during semesters, the daily fluctuations are huge. The good thing is that it sounds like your wife monitors closely and is comfortable adjusting insulin on her own, which is super helpful. The best advice I can give is  don’t let anything that looks like a pattern go for more than 2 days, but do wait the 2 days before making further major changes. (Of course during that time, treat lows and highs as appropriate.)
Bigger-picture advice, if I may: having a child means not having any control over a whole host of things (everything?) while you desperately try to. So one lesson to already work on during pregnancy for both of you is to let go of that particular illusion and as much as possible the neuroses.

And just this past week (21 for the baby) she’s started to experience some sticky hypers, so we’ve had to increase her Basal.

(I have had one surgery under full anesthesia as a child, not that I remember much of it.) But it is completely routine and very brief - 30 minutes or so.
Is it just the psychological discomfort about something you are unfamiliar with, or are there other specific worries you have (for example, regarding your BG in the meantime)? I had my husband in the main exam room until they took me over to the “mini-OR” where the retrieval took place and that gave me comfort. If I remember correctly, I chose to take off my pump during the procedure (I can easily go up to an hour off without major impact to my BG, but I know this is not the same for everyone) and didn’t wear a sensor so that there were no alarms, etc. that someone else might have to deal with while I was under. It is truly painless and in my case I didn’t have any strong discomfort afterward either. Obviously I measured as I was going in to make sure I was at a good level and then had my husband measure me as soon as I came out (I was a little drowsy for a while). His memory is that I was a little low, something in the 70s so I didn’t even connect back until a little later still, but I don’t remember those details.

Hello!
How are you doing now?
I did IVF 2 in 2014, then I had problems with high sugar. Had to control the level of insulin constantly and consult with the doctor every day. But such caution allowed me to give birth to a daughter, for which I am grateful to God!

I just got back from a much needed vacation.  All this fertility stuff is so intense!
I’m probably not going to try another round of IVF.  I had an appointment with my diabetes endo before I left on vacation and got the news that the retinopathy in one of my eyes had gotten worse over the course of the 2 IVF medication rounds.  I have had mild retinopathy for about ten years, so any change gives me concern.  On top of that, I feel like the fertility clinic I was going to really lacked the personal touch.

After all the hormone injections,  the emotional rollercoastering, yeah just cancel it, easy-peasy.  It really stuck with me, it seemed really callous.

ARBs  (angiotensin receptor blocker) – a type of oral medication used to lower blood pressure (“ARBs” on TuDiabetes).
Atherosclerosis  – a process that involves thickening of the blood vessel walls thought to be related to inflammation of the vessel wall, which then leads to formation of plaques, causing partial blockages. If these plaques rupture, clots form on that rupture site, causing a more acute, total blockage. If the blood vessel is providing blood to the heart, the result would be a heart attack (“Atherosclerosis” on TuDiabetes).
Autoimmune disease  – disorder of the body’s immune system in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys body tissue considered foreign (“Autoimmune” on TuDiabetes).

Blood Sugar, Blood Glucose  (BS, BG, or glucose) – a type of sugar that is created when the carbohydrate that one eats is broken down in the body. During digestion, glucose passes through the wall of the intestine into the bloodstream to the liver and eventually into the general circulation. From there glucose can then enter individual cells or tissues throughout the body to be used for fuel and provide energy. (“Blood Glucose” on TuDiabetes).
Blood Pressure – the pressure against the walls of your blood vessels. High blood pressure is more common in persons with diabetes and increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney and eye diseases.

Gastroparesis  – a condition in which neuropathy affects the nerves controlling the digestive tract and causes difficulty processing or disposing of food. It can cause nausea, vomiting, bloating or diarrhea. (“Gastroparesis” on TuDiabetes).
Gestational diabetes  – diabetes that develops during pregnancy. During this time, some women will have only a minimal insulin deficiency and will be able to adequately control their blood glucose with a meal plan. Other women may have a more severe insulin deficiency and require insulin along with nutrition therapy to control their blood glucose. This type of diabetes usually lasts only through the pregnancy, but women who have it may be at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on. (“Gestational diabetes” on TuDiabetes).

Glucose Meter – a device that measures one’s blood glucose levels (“Glucose Meter” on TuDiabetes).
Glucose tolerance test  – blood test done every hour or at the 2-hour point after drinking a sugar-filled liquid. This is one test used to diagnose diabetes. If at 2 hours, your blood glucose rises to over 200 mg/dl you have diabetes. This test is not as common as a fasting glucose test (“Glucose tolerance test” on TuDiabetes).
Glycemic index (GI)  – a system of ranking foods containing equal amounts of carbohydrate according to how much they raise blood glucose levels. For instance, the carbohydrate in a slice of 100% stone-ground whole wheat bread (a low glycemic index food) may have less impact on blood glucose than a slice of processed white bread (a high glycemic index food). The GI is an additional meal-planning tool to help one understand how carbohydrate foods can differ in their effects on blood glucose (“Glycemic index” on TuDiabetes).
Glycemic load (GL)  – a system of ranking carbohydrate foods based on how much they raise blood glucose levels that combines the GI value and the carbohydrate content of an average serving of a food, of a meal, or of a day’s worth of food (“Glycemic load” on TuDiabetes).
Glycogen  – glucose that is stored in muscles and liver (“Glycogen” on TuDiabetes).
HDL (high-density lipoprotein—also called “good” cholesterol)  – a type of blood cholesterol that sweeps excess cholesterol from the blood back to the liver where it is reprocessed or eliminated. (“HDL” on TuDiabetes)
Hormones  – chemical messengers made in one part of the body to transfer “information” through the bloodstream to cells in another part of the body. Insulin is a hormone (“Hormones” on TuDiabetes).
Hyperglycemia  – high blood glucose levels. Blood glucose is generally considered “high” when it is 160 mg/dl or above your individual blood glucose target. (“Hyperglycemia” on TuDiabetes).
Hyperinsulinemia  - a condition in which there are excess levels of insulin circulating in the blood relative to the level of glucose. In people using injected insulin, hyperinsulinemia raises the risk of hypoglycemia or low blood glucose.
Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)  – a serious condition resulting from extremely high levels of blood glucose, causing excessive urination and severe dehydration, but without ketones. It is not very common (“Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state” on TuDiabetes).
Hypertension  – high blood pressure (blood flows through the blood vessels with a greater than normal force) which is defined as blood pressure equal to or greater than 140/90 mm Hg and affects the majority of adults with diabetes. It increases one’s risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney problems. (“Hypertension” on TuDiabetes).
Hypoglycemia  (hypo) – a blood glucose below 80 mg/dl with or without symptoms or below 90 mg/dl with symptoms. Also known as Insulin reaction resulting from either too much insulin, too much activity, or too little food. (“Hypoglicemia” on TuDiabetes).

Trans fats are found in processed foods, such as snack foods, cookies, fast foods, and some stick or solid margarines. They can raise cholesterol levels and should be eaten in as small amounts as possible (“Trans fats” on TuDiabetes).
Triglycerides  – a type of fat stored in fat cells as body fat and burned for energy. High levels of triglycerides are linked with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease (“Triglycerides” on TuDiabetes).
Unsaturated fat (both polyunsaturated and monounsaturated)  – fats that comes primarily from vegetables and are liquid at room temperature. Polyunsaturated fats can help lower cholesterol levels. Monounsaturated fats also help lower blood cholesterol levels and may help to raise HDL cholesterol levels (“Unsaturated fat” on TuDiabetes).

1617,T1D with no insurance?,Community,Community,amand,,"Hi all,
I’m working on a film that portrays someone struggling with type 1 diabetes. We’re eager to represent this onscreen, as we feel it’s rarely depicted. In doing so, we want to make sure we convey the struggle of living with T1D with accuracy and authenticity.
Does anyone have experience dealing with T1D during a lapse in insurance or without proper coverage who would be willing to answer some questions on what that’s like?",10d
1618,T1D with no insurance?,Community,Community,mohe0001,,"You buy insulin over the counter (no prescription required) at Walmart. This type of long acting insulin is called NPH and was used heavily in the 1990’s.
Syringes can be more of a problem, depending on what state you live in. States often require an Rx for syringes to prevent drug use. Diabetics who live in states that are hard on syringe access can expect problems. In places like Minnesota, where pharmacists are required to supply (even drug addicts) with some syringes, they can get by a little easier.
But, the opioid epidemic has effects on people with valid prescriptions and insurance, too. Patients aren’t permitted physical possession of their prescriptions. Thats because people were forging Rx’s like crazy to gain access to opioids. That makes things more difficult for diabetics. Patients may never get to see their Rx’s or their expiration dates. Paperwork gets lost in pharmacy computer systems and patients have very little control over how this information is managed. I loose access to my supplies somewhat frequently because of that.",10d
1619,T1D with no insurance?,Community,Community,Robyn_H,1,"I went from ages 18-36 with no issuance coverage.  I only finally got coverage 3.5 years ago, opening up the door to better treatment options.  So I could offer some pretty informed insight.",10d
1620,T1D with no insurance?,Community,Community,amand,,Thanks for your response Robyn. Would it be possible to connect with you somehow (maybe by e-mail) to ask some questions?,10d
1621,T1D with no insurance?,Community,Community,DrBBType 1 or LADA,2,"As background for what you’re looking at, a couple of things that are frequently misunderstood:


“Insulin” isn’t just one thing. There are multiple formulations with different durations and effect curves. You have to know a lot about how your own body works (insulin-carb ratio, correction ratio, other stuff) as well as how the insulin you’re taking works in order to use it safely.


“Walmart insulin”: basically the stuff those of us diagnosed back in the 80s to late-90s were on, and it is a very different beast to the analog insulins developed since then. Harder to predict effect times, thus more likely to cause dangerous lows (I speak from 20 yrs experience). It can keep you alive, so yay, but it isn’t like swapping in the generic OTC version of Tylenol or whatever. You have to organize your life around it.


“Diabetic coma”: this pseudo-medical term drives me nuts because I don’t know what the person means by it, especially when used by reporters or other non-diabetics. Are they referring to Diabetic Keto-Acidosis (DKA), which results from lack of insulin, or hypoglycemic unconsciousness—what is usually portrayed in TV episodes—which can result from taking insulin? In the case of rationing scenarios, DKA would be the presumptive interpretation, but not always, because allowing yourself to run “high” to save money but not so high as to kill yourself is not a straight-line thing, like adjusting a thermostat. We call it the roller-coaster phenomenon, when trying to control peaks can result in deep valleys, especially if you’re trying to use something you’re not familiar with like the Walmart stuff.


Hoarding: ALL T1s hoard, or if they don’t, they should. Applies to all supplies but insulin most of all. Because guess what: if you run out, you can die. You’re always aware of it, even if not immediately threatened by loss of insurance coverage. That’s why it’s humorously referred to as the “zombie apocalypse” stash: “because you never know…”  It becomes almost neurotically hard to throw stuff away—kind of a perennial topic on these forums actually. So even if we’re not rationing, we’re all living under that shadow to a greater or lesser extent.


You could do worse than to search “rationing” on this and other diabetic forums to see how we discuss the issue and the media reports around it. There’s a lot of sympathy, because “there but for the grace of god,” but also an oddly judgmental strain in some of the comments you see. I think that’s defensive in a way: reassuring ourselves that WE’D know what to do even if those other poor saps couldn’t figure it out.",10d
1622,T1D with no insurance?,Community,Community,MM1,,"


 amand:

I’m working on a film that portrays someone struggling with type 1 diabetes.


It would be interesting if your key person with T1D participates in on-line or in person interactions with other diabetics.
There are many with insurance that still don’t get good care, for various reasons, lack of insurance is just one situation that impacts ability to get care.
Awareness of low cost alternatives takes interactions with others, good search techniques and sometimes a doctor with “samples” that knows you’re in need.
Insurance (or lack of) is just a small piece of our daily challenges.",10d
1623,T1D with no insurance?,Community,Community,Tim12,,"I was T1 without insurance for a decade. Buying OTC insulin (this was the 90’s so mostly the old fashioned insulins, not the ridic OTC price for modern insulins we read about), test strips, trying not to get sick, unable to afford a doctors appointment, dang sure unable to pay for any lab tests. The “list price” (what you pay if uninsured) for lab tests are INSANE.",10d
1624,T1D with no insurance?,Community,Community,Jim26Type 1 or LADA,,"I went through my formative years with only catchphrase insurance (hospitalization, surgery etc…)and Insulin, tests, test strips, and doctors appointments were all affordable.  Then low behold insurance became involved in every part of Healthcare and suddenly nothing is affordable.  What’s wrong with that picture??  There’s the story.",10d
1625,T1D with no insurance?,Community,Community,Timothy,,"I had a time where I had no insurance.
I had a pump so I started pumping regular insulin because that’s all I could get and afford at that time.
The pharmacy would sell it with no script.
I also cut my finger testing to once a day. The price has come down a bit for those.
But it was $1 each and once a day was all I could manage.
I would also reuse my cartridges and tubing.
I would buy infusion sets from a website located in Mexico.they seemed cheaply made but it worked.
Luckily over that 6 months I never needed to go to a doctor otherwise I was not going to have any way to pay for it.
It’s like a gigantic ponsy scheme. You need to pay a doctor to get access to things that  have prices that are so inflated, no one could pay for them.
Insurance was not possible because if you are diabetic you can’t get insurance.
Except until Obamacare. Now you can but it is still crazy expensive.
If I paid for my monthly needs it would be about $3000 per month.
The system is set up so that we can’t afford it, and if the pre existing rule of Obama care is remove by the Supreme Court, then we ar back to being uninsurable.
It is a real and anxious and scary life to be diabetic especially in the US.
It seems like every year the insulin prices go up and they threaten our insurance coverage.
My favorite moment is when the president made a statement that insulin was so cheap it is like water.
Yes if you pay $400 for 10ml of water. 3 or 4 times a month.",9d
1626,"Xdrip problems, unable to upload, bluetooth connection errors",Community,Community,SusanS,,"For the past 2-3 weeks I have been receiving error messages on my phone with a pairing request. It prompts me to pair my bluetooth to the DexcomH3 receiver every 1-1.5 minutes. If I don’t answer the alert and press the “pair” prompt, my transmitter/sensor disconnects from Xdrip and I do not get readings. Not great for sleeping which is when I need those alerts. I turned on my old Dexcom receiver 3 days ago and it has no problems detecting the transmitter data…ever. It’s just that the sound isn’t loud enough for me to always hear an alert which is a reason why I stopped using it. I do not know how to fix the problem other than to remove Xdrip and re-install the app…if that will even help the problem Grrr. I don’t think it matters but I have an LG V60 ThinQ that was purchased in October.
Which brings me to my next issue. I have not figured out how to upload my data to Dexcom site. I entered my Dexcom username/password into Xdrip but nothing happens. IDK if I am doing something wrong or if it is somehow related to my bluetooth problem. But, if I uninstall the app, I lose all my data. I have an endo
MD appointment Thursday and can’t go there with less than a week of data for the past 3 months.
The other issue is I am supposed to go to endo educator TOMORROW for my 3 hour pump training. How am I supposed to do that if I can’t get my readings properly from my Dexcom equipment?
I am a tech idiot and can’t figure out how to fix it. No one in my house knows what the problem is. I even went to the bluetooth settings in my phone, unpaired everything and then paired devices again. My car bluetooth, no problem staying connected but Xdrip…still no. I get an error message that it cannot pair with the DexcomH3 or nothing happens at all. Phone tells me the DexcomH3 is an available device but when I try to connect to it, nothing happens.",13d

You are totally right, there is. However, Dexcom won’t accept the data because the authorization “handshake” is invalid.

As a third-party app that competes with Dexcom it’s probably not going to happen anytime soon which is why there’s all kinds of workarounds that other people have implemented.",13d

I working in an office with lots of people around, so EVERY time my pump alarms, it lets off an audible alarm and a loud vibration, which everyone can hear.  This is unfortunate as I normally interrupt meetings I am in with those loud alarms.  When I contacted TSLIM they told me that those were important alarms and that everyone around me needed to hear them.  The other thing is that after one alarm goes off, I may get an alarm for something else.  Does anyone else have this problem?  When I was on a Medtronic pump, it would alarm every 15 minutes.  With Tslim it’s every 2 - 3 minutes.  I’m just getting tired of all these alarms!  I love the Tslim pump technology wise, it’s just those darn alarms.

What version of software/firmware are you using? I believe the latest version is “Moonlight v7.4”. While I don’t know for sure, I got the impression from earlier posts that alarm behavior may have changed as the software has evolved.
FWIW, below is a link to a Tandem vid about finding the software version of your pump. Be aware that vid instructions mostly work, but are out of date. With my v7.4 pump I had to scroll down once in the “Pump Info” section to view the software version.

How do I check what software version is on my pump? [video]
From the Home screen, tap “Options.”
Select “My Pump” from the menu.
Using the Down Arrow if necessary, go to the bottom of the menu, andTap “Pump Info.”

I definitely think Control-IQ equals less work!  But, it’s by choice and extra effort in the beginning.  It took me nearly a month to get my optimum settings worked out, but once they are, it’s like Ron Popeil is living in my pump.  “Set it and forget it!” (Did I just date myself???)
I don’t bother counting carbs or stressing over every nibble anymore.  Control-Iq can literally smooth over all the bumps.  I’ve got my basal rates set intentionally high and my correction factor set low, and I stay in sleep mode nearly all the time.  (I just learned @Laddie 's reference to “sleeping beauties” love it!)   These are settings that make the system conform best to my needs.  It opens the availability of insulin to the system, so it can use what it needs to keep me in a happy range.  The reduced correction factor also improves it’s ability to prevent lows.  The combined effect is that I can just generally throw insulin at food, stress much less about everything, and still obtain the best control of my life.
Some would find my behavior risky, but I don’t.  I took way more risks using the R/NPH regiment for 28 years with it’s wild swings, and still slept through the night without any tech monitoring me.  If the lows didn’t get me then, I’m sure as heck not afraid of them now with so many other safety measures in place.",20d

@Robyn_H, please clarify. Are you saying that your correction factor number is set higher for less effect or lower for greater effect? This always confuses me. After a year, I am still hassling with CIQ to just maintain my previous A1c. I would love it to be less work.",19d
1654,Closed loop and Medicare,Community,Community,Robyn_H,,"Actual lower number.  My “true” correction factor should be 1:46, but I have it set to 1:40 or 1:42 in most segments.  Small changes here make a big difference.  You can see, it’s not a big enough change to really throw off the bolus calculator. (Not that I use it anymore, but I know most do).
Since Control-IQ works in both directions we can redefine what the correction factor is.  It’s going to bring you back to target eventually, no matter what this number is, it’s exactly like trying to correct yourself with an extended bolus, though. You’re only getting a fraction of the correction every five (or 6?) minutes. It should now be thought of as how fast you want correction automations to work.  The higher the correction factor, the slower the correction and the flatter your basal trend.  Too high, and it’s like flat-lining your basal rate.  It’s crippled for both correcting highs and lows.  The lower the number, the steeper the basal changes happen.  The lower the number, the faster you’ll recover from lows and more likely to avoid them in the first place, AND the faster you’ll bring down an elevated BG via basal changes alone.
So why not just set your correction factor at 1:1? Or some other ridiculously low number? That sounds like a good thing…  But no, if you go too low, you actually get over-corrections on both ends. If you’re looking at your CGM stats, your GVI will go up.  It will withhold too much insulin for a low, and you’ll shoot back up high, then it will deliver too much correction insulin and you’ll overshoot the low threshold before it can turn it around again… And the sharp up and down cycle repeats.
For those that understand wave dynamics, we’re talking a basic sine wave:

Reduced numerical correction factor (the numerical value) = decreased wavelength and increased amplitude.
Increased correction factor (the numerical value) = increased wavelength and decreased amplitude.
The axis of your wave (mid-point, baseline, node) is established by your basal rate.  If your wave is fluctuating nicely but your BG is staying too high, increase your basal.  If it’s fluctuating nicely but your staying too too low, decrease your basal.


Sorry @lainiep .  I know this is a lot of information, and may seem overwhelming.  But once you get the settings dialed in where you want them, it does equal a much easier solution going forward from there.",19d
1655,Closed loop and Medicare,Community,Community,irrational_JohnType 1 or LADA,,"Per the ref quoted below from the link below, another common term for “correction factor” is “Insulin sensitivity factor” or ISF.
Your ISF is the amount 1 unit of insulin will decrease your Blood Glucose.  In the United States, this is measured in mg/dL (milligrams per decilitre). The number will look differently in other countries where BG is measured in mmol/L (millimoles per liter).
A pump uses the ISF (or CF) to determine how much insulin to bolus to correct a high BG. You divide the amount you want your BG to decrease by the ISF to get the amount of insulin for the bolus. Because you are dividing by the ISF, a smaller ISF results in a larger bolus.

For those of us who’ve been dealing with T1 and T2 diabetes for decades, we’ve  been through this many times.
This story trades on the regrettable ignorance and short attention span of our society. Many people never read beyond the headlines. I just replied to a top post on a heavily-trafficked political website about this “cure.” I was the 66th comment and the first to point out this was a story about a diabetes cure in mice!
We struggle with the ignorance of society about diabetes. In order to protect our mental health, we’ve built up an emotional defense to the consequences of this ignorance. I’ve long ago accepted that this social ignorance is simply a consequence of human nature. People pay the most attention to the things that directly affect them. Learning the details of other people’s struggles is not as engaging.
I’m as guilty of this as my fellow humans. For instance, I don’t know much about muscular dystrophy. My primary focus on things medical is on T1D, a disease with an immediate and long-lasting personal effect.
If I could teach gluco-normals just one thing about diabetes, I would need to select it from a long list.


T1D is not T2D!


When media uses the word, diabetes, it really means T2D.


When headline writers uses the word cure in the context of diabetes, it almost always is a disingenuous and misleading tactic to reach more eyeballs.


Studies that report a T1D cure in mice are common and has yet, not even once, translated to a cure for T1D.


T1D is not juvenile diabetes, adult diagnosis is just as common as childhood diagnosis.


As a T1D, I cannot reverse my diabetes simply by losing weight.


For a T1D, insulin is rarely optional.

I’d rather not stir up the naming issue in this thread. I understand your rationale and do agree, but it’s complicated by the small number of T1Ds versus T2Ds as a basis for research funding and other political circumstances. Grassroots education about T1D as autoimmune and T2D as insulin resistance seems a better expenditure in resources.
As far as the “bad” type of diabetes, while I think that T1D requires more continuous attention, the comorbidities and mortality rates seem similar to me. T2D is much less demanding during the often long-undiagnosed period while it insidiously exacts long-term damage.
Couple that with a medical practitioner and societal lack of urgency regarding treatment causes many with T2D to feel any pressing need for effective treatment. “Just take your pills and move on with life” is a dangerous attitude that many settle into.
T1D, by contrast, demands your immediate attention and treatment. Ignore T1D and you will soon reach your expiration date! I’d rather live with T1D as it seems less complicated than T2D. I wouldn’t argue either type as better than the other.",Nov '20

I do know that many people with diabetes hide their condition and that can end up with both positive and negative effects. See @Brianna1’s all too common perception of workplace discrimination, often fueled by ignorance.
I agree, however, that making diabetes apparent to emergency staff is a good thing, providing that they understand the difference between T1D and T2D.
Far too many medical practitioners, including doctors and nurses don’t quite get the distinction between the two types. I learned this from the sincere questions from medicos when undergoing medical procedures and during office visits. I’ve been asked by medical staff when I inform them that I live with type 1 diabetes and they follow-up with, “Do you take insulin?” I am most surprised when I detect ignorance from an endocrinologist.

I just wrote on another thread some of the problems it now causes. A doctor telling a T1 recently that squash has too much sugar for her to eat. A chiro who had been a neonatal nurse before becoming a chiro telling me a couple of years ago that since I didn’t get it as a kid I could cure it. And 10 years ago a GP telling me medications wouldn’t have worked on me at all if I was a type 1.
Some of the newly diagnosed end up being very confused about what type they have and what it means. The newly diagnosed type 1 asking if they eat right can they get off of insulin, the type 2 that has really high levels and put on insulin right away to bring down their levels and thinks they have to be on insulin the rest of their life or worse they don’t have to change anything because insulin solves the issue. The fact that some type 2’s take insulin just helps mix and blend the two together.
I really feel the blending and mixing of the two types is compromising care and the ability it seems like for type 1’s to have access to what their type actually means in treatment, in diet, and that trickles down to accessing the tools that can help us.
And then there’s diabetes insipidus, this one is because the origin of latin diabetes definition is “passing through, a large discharge of urine” and diabetes insipidus is a disease that has nothing to do with the pancreas or blood sugar but it happens when the kidneys produce a lot of extra pee.

An inability for people to update their knowledge in the presence of new information is a problem. I think the emotion part of the brain over-rules the fact part of the brain every time. Perhaps people’s fear is what drives their inability to adjust to new information.
In any case, you still need to deal with this. You and your doctor know what type of diabetes you live with. As long as you base your treatments on this reality, you can thrive.
The more difficult problem you face is that your social circle does not support your everyday efforts. Perhaps you could seek some counseling that would help you deal with this.

 John_S2:

In your experience, do you have an estimate of the percentage of calls that were either directly related to diabetes or that knowing someone was either T1 or T2 would have made a significant difference in your treatment and/or approach?


I’ll add to what Jay6 replied, as a younger diabetic and ex-EMT. I would say that the primary influence of diabetes on protocol (especially now) is that almost EVERYONE gets a blood sugar reading when I work . But, when other people work, certainly EVERYONE who is drunk or has any kind of altered level of consciousness SHOULD get a BG. But, they do not always.
I think that what is important to recognize is that cops are (generally) 1st responders (1 license step below EMTs) and they don’t check BG. Although they might be ‘varianced’ to do this in some jurisdictions. That will be determined by your local Medical Director (who is the King Doctor for your areas local Emergency Medical System). The thing about cops is that there is a difference in perspective. Police will almost always assume that you are drunk or on drugs. But, if you are out cold, police (or anyone) can check med tags. Med tags help. When I worked with other EMTS, I was a HUGE proponent for med tags. If people don’t check med tags, then we have a discussion.
If your medics can physically see that you are a diabetic, there is a greater chance that they take control of the scene (as opposed to the police). We want the medics in control, not the cops because cops will take you to jail and assume drunk/drug use every time. Med tags help you advocate for your medics so that they can advocate for you. When cops and EMTs disagree, cops often win (although that is NOT how it is supposed to work - they are both peace officers).
“A law passed in 2015 has cleared the way for more first responders to check patients’ blood glucose levels . Previously, only advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics were allowed to conduct the simple finger sticks that can indicate a patient may be diabetic” (Indiana State Law - https://www.in.gov/dhs/files/HR_Jan_16.pdf).
Here’s some stats that cite 2% of all EMS calls are attributable to diabetic symptoms.

EMS1 2



How frequently do EMS providers encounter, treat hypoglycemia? 2
Top takeaways for prehospital care of diabetic patients after filtering 2.5 million EMS encounters in the EMS Index





“Primary Impression” means that they look at you and can tell your in diabetic shock - not that they have checked BG. Primary impression can dictate who takes primary control over the event - the police or the medics. EMTs can argue & disagree about primary impression. Police and EMTs can disagree over primary impression. You want to help them get this right. If they see med tags, that really helps them make their case that this is indeed a ‘medical event,’ not a call for a drunk.
EMTs and paramedics will not treat hyperglycemia. They treat hypoglycemia. Knowing that someone has a common chronic illness is very important and helps dictate treatment. There are many, many circumstances that cause someone to pass out. Med tags help direct them to the most likely cause of the problem very quickly and are very helpful because sometimes people have more than one problem at the same time.
Compare the % of diabetic calls that medics get (2%) to the % of calls that the police get for someone who is intoxicated (36%). That is why police always believe that we are drunk…because everyone (over 1/3 of people that) they deal with are drunk. That tells you why diabetes is dangerous ground - also sometimes diabetics have low BG AND they are drunk. People get confused, get it wrong, and are very biased towards assuming that we are drunk. That is very dangerous for us. But, it is also very dangerous for people with other conditions, too. The police may assume that they are on drugs if their behavior isn’t normal.

And they knew that. They were eager to see it. I still run across medical staff that don’t know what it is. I remember showing the pharmacist the Dexcom, they said they got a video to watch but had never actually seen one.
Lol…I am one of those if that is constantly asking if people have seen a Dexcom and show them mine and how it works (it is on my arm). I also am constantly showing people the Libre on my dog. Although that is more for the fact that people know that they can be used on a dog, since so many dogs end up with diabetes.
But why would police recognize a pump even less seen or used? Or even EMT’s? Unless it’s shrieking or something so that then they try to figure out what it is and why? I’m not medical personal, but I wouldn’t recognize different pumps? Except for an Omnipod which I wear.",Nov '20

At 56, I’ve been T2 for almost exactly 9 years - was a decently-controlled pre-diabetic that accidentally/mistakenly had steroids included with my chemo infusions for a week or so.  Almost overnight, my BG went from 125 to 396.  Unlike with prednisone, when I got off the steroid, my BG never came back down to a pre-diabetic level. I’ve been insulin-dependent ever since. Because I have an ileostomy due to the cancer, I’m unable to tolerate high fiber foods, making it more difficult to eat the way the CDEs & RDs would prefer (and I’ve tried several dietitians/nutritionists who said they understood the juxtaposition, but usually just told me to count carbs & calories, without suggestions for what to replace them with).
Sometimes I’ve been a “good” diabetic and gotten my A1C down in the mid 6s (usually with an Atkins-like diet) and other times, I’ve been frustrated, said screw it and let it get in the 12s. I could blame it on hating fingerpricks or a bad memory, but really I just preferred to enjoy food because life’s too short already.
I started using the 10-day Freestyle Libre almost a year ago and find it a godsend and, particularly, after the change to 14-day with a 1-hour startup.

1751,Intro,Community,Community,TapestryType 1 or LADA,2,"Hello and welcome to TuDiabetes, Russell @The_Burn,
I’ve been using an OmniPod for several years now.  My basal rates are between 0.05 and 0.09 units per hour.  My insulin to carb ratio ranges between 1:6 to 1:30 depending upon the time of day.  My max bolus with the OmniPod is 8 units but I rarely went over a 5 unit bolus (my typical bolus was 2 to 3 units).  My total daily dose (basal and bolus) via the OmniPod was in the 25-35 unit range.
Then life happened.  I started to have highs I could not control, no matter how much I bolused or increased my basal.
I stumbled on something called “tunneling” with OmniPods.  Turns out I was having absorption issues and the insulin was coming back out of the pod (the tunneling problem).  I didn’t realize it for a very long time.  Once I did, I changed a few things.  1) I changed pod placement from my belly to other areas of my body.  2) I only use the OmniPod for basal and I inject all boluses (meal and correction) with a syringe and vial of insulin.  These steps have worked like a charm.
I’ve heard from others in the DOC (Diabetes Online Community) that OmniPod is best delivered in small doses; anything over 4ish units and it begins to tunnel (backup).  I’m mentioning this because I’m sensing your insulin needs may cause similar problems for you and I thought it would help if you were aware of them.
Other podders may have different experiences and work-arounds and hopefully they will come around an chime in!

Get a Dexcom if you can. One thing good about the Dexcom. The alerts, at first they were annoying. Then I decided to use them to my advantage, not just as alerts at being too high or too low already.  But I used the alerts as a warning that I am approaching numbers I don’t want to be at. Although I guess the miao miao right now can be used to turn the Libre into a CGM with alerts.
I prebolus plus I will not even eat my meal unless I am under 110. maybe I will cave on that if under 120 with a graph arrow saying I am dropping. But maybe try when you are sitting at 200 giving yourself an adjustment and wait to eat until you have dropped to a much lower number? As you know with kidney disease you really need
some lower numbers.
What’s great about an Omnipod (any pump) is the ability to adjust the basal rate as you actually need it. Plus the ability to give small adjustments constantly as you need it. That combined with a CGM can really help with control of BG numbers. Look at your CGM see you are a little high, push a button for an adjustment. It’s great.
@Tapestry has some really good points about high doses on the Omnipod. A lot of people have complained about higher dosing on an Omnipod, Plus sometimes you get site failures with any pump and your numbers will go up. It might be best if you are taking bigger doses to do your bolus for meals still in a shot and save your pump for smaller adjustments and basal rate.
The other thing you will run into is the pod only holds 200 units of insulin by volume. So you will get close to using that up in 3 days by basal rate alone. Your needs  of basal usually go down with a pump so you also should have a little more wiggle room for small adjustments in small bolus amounts, You could consider using the double Humalog concentrate , the 200 instead, then the pod will last longer with more actual insulin in it. Trickier to program, but once you understand it, it’s not hard. I use the Humalog 200 in my Omnipod.

I tested  negative for gad antibodies but my cpeptide was low. My diagnosis says t1d and my first appointment they said t1d but my appointment the other day they said type 2 but i don’t make insulin anymore.  Either way I’m fairly confused by that but im not sure it really matters. I was told in 2019 i may be prediabetic and needed to lose weight (im 5’11 and i weighed 209). That was the first er visit in 2 weeks.  They thought i may be having a heart attack.  2 weeks later i was back for a panic attack.  12 hours after that i was back vomiting blood and diagnosed with  gallstones. 24 hours later i was back with acute cholysystitis and obstruction and had to have surgery. Within a year and half of the surgery i lost 50 pounds. I also started having issues with dizziness and nausea if i didn’t eat.  In August i started to feel thirsty often.  It got worse and worse and my hair started to fall out and i lost 10 pounds in a few days. After about a week and a half of barely being able to get out of bed and almost passing out i went to the er and was in dka. And now here I am.,Nov '20
1761,Intro,Community,Community,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,,"There are a few type 1’s that don’t test positive for antibodies, they don’t know why. My DE is one of those, she makes no insulin but doesn’t have the antibodies.
Don’t let them label you a type 2. Type 1 if you test positive for the antibodies that’s a definitive yes. But if you have low c peptide that is also a yes. A type 1 especially a LADA/type 1 slowly loses the ability to make insulin and their c-peptide will be low normal or low and that can vary some as you lose the ability over time to make insulin. Eventually it lands at zero or close to zero. But your pancreas will keep trying sometimes up to 8 years plus. But a type 2 will test high or high normal because they have a different issue, they are insulin resistant, so they make enough insulin and usually more than normal as their body tries to make up for it.
If you are low on the c peptide, you do not fit a type 2. Unfortunately too many doctors still misdiagnose type 1. I still hear about it. The knowledge is really lacking sometimes in GP’s.
DKA is generally a type 1 issue unless you are on certain diabetic medications. DKA isn’t caused by high blood sugars, it is caused by lack of insulin.
It does matter what you are labeled for most people. Insurance and proper treatment. If you are labeled a type 1 it is easier to get tools we use okayed by insurance. Plus they are more likely to set up the proper treatment needed, insulin, which is critical, pumps, cgm’s which can be helpful etc.
Hopefully someone just glanced at the chart and saw no antibodies and said type 2. Hopefully they did not change the original diagnosis. Sometimes a nurse or doctor or something will not really read the chart???
But you also should get a copy of the results and see what tests they ran. They commonly just test for the one most common antibody test which is Gad, but there are a few other antibody tests. But there are several type 1 types of diabetes that just don’t fit the common molds. There is also one that is caused by steroid use or panceas trauma, sometimes in those cases insulin production can return.

1763,Is “gluten-free” another fad diet or is there something to it?,Community,Community,jlp515,1,"Lately I have heard a lot about a gluten free diet being referred to as the ""next fad diet"" (which kinda aggravates me). It may be a fad for some, but for many of us, it is a necessary way of life.To start, the wheat we are eating nowadays is far different than it used to be.The strains have been crossbred over the years leading to a wheat that has 50% more gluten than its counterparts!To top it off, for most of us, our bodies are not meant to be able to digest this much gluten. Therefore, if your body is sensitive to it, even a small amount could be detrimental to your health.I know a lot of you have discovered you have some degree of intolerance to wheat, whether it’s a sensitivity or a true allergy. I have as well, and I think it’s at least worth looking into if you've been experiencing some of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity.(see below)So what is gluten? It’s a protein found in products containing wheat. It is estimated that celiac disease (a gluten allergy) affects between 0.7% and 1% of the population. However, it’s estimated that up to 1 in 20 people in the US could have NCGS (Non celiac gluten sensitivity). It’s difficult to estimate the exact prevalence of NCGS because there is no definitive test for it. One way to find out if you’re sensitive to gluten is to remove it from your diet for a couple weeks and monitor your symptoms to see if they improve.If you have NCGS you have trouble absorbing essential nutrients from food. In fact, gluten could be damaging the lining of your intestine causing leaky gut syndrome and also causing an imbalance in your gut flora (the important bacteria that regulates your immune system).Leaky gut is something we don’t hear about often (not sure why) but it can be very dangerous to your health. It can cause inflammation which can lead to chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes as well as autoimmune diseases. In fact, more and more research is showing a strong link between type 1 diabetes and celiac disease and some doctors are even testing for this upon diagnosis(good idea).Americans have increased their wheat intake over the years (because we've been told it’s healthy for us), but each of us should still evaluate whether or not the recommended nutrition guidelines are working for us. It takes some experimentation and time, (believe me, I know I am still experimenting) to find out how your body reacts to different foods, but it’s worth it in the long run.I’m definitely not an expert in this area, just stumbled upon all of this a few years ago for personal reasons, but the more I learn the more fascinated I am. I think it is definitely something that is not talked about nearly enough in the healthcare field but needs to be. It’s really amazing how important food is to our heath.JodiFor a list of symptoms of NCGS visit this website:  • http://www.celiaccentral.org/non-celiac-gluten-sensitivity/ 1References: • http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-kresser/gluten-intolerance_b_2964812.html

For those of us who have has this disease for a long time we remember what finger sticks meant.
It was never an absolute value. It was always an approximate range.
First they were strips where you put I giant drop of blood. Then you wiped it off with cotton then timed it again.at that point you compared it to a chart. And the ranges were something like under60,60-100,100-150 etc.
you never really knew and if your timing was off it was worthless.
Then those same strips were used to put in a meter after the third step to give you a number, however it was no more accurate.
Then came the modern ones that use an electrical charge mixed with hexonase to give you a one step reading. However it mattered how much blood you put on the strip so you were still dependent on technique.
Now we have the same technology but the strips allow only a certain amount of blood and fail when it’s too small.
So it’s better however it’s really never been accurate per se.
this is why with my g6 I usually just check with my meter and if it’s close I don’t bother checking it again.

1779,Glucose test meters,Community,Community,Jay6,,"@Mustafayem, opinions are like noses, for the most part we all have one and they are all different.
There are two issues here.  FIRST is meter accuracy.  Depending source most reliable sources will say a finger stick blood glucose should be within  ±20mg/dL.  With the numbers you in your message, 162 and 148 are equal because if you add or subtract 20 from either number, the opposite number is there.
Specifically, 162-20 = 142  and 148 + 20 = 168   so according to most experts, these two measurements are close enough.
For more information, check out: Glucose Meters: A Review of Technical Challenges to Obtaining Accurate Results 1
As far as meter brands are concerned, the nearest comparison is the brand of car driven.  Some people swear by a brand of car as positive and nothing could be better.  At the same time, another person would tell you the first person’s choice was junk and should never be permitted on the road, anywhere.
So, what meter should you select.  Discuss the meter, possibly its test method, and its communication features with your doctor.  You want a meter approved by the approving authority where you are.  In the USA, it is the Food & Drug Administration.  Second, if your doctor wants meter data sent electronically, you would want a meter compatible with the communication method used by the doctor & functional with your computer, etc.
Please share what you decide.  It is how we all learn here.  Wishing you the best.",Nov '20

1798,670g low suspend if auto mode off?,Community,Community,Rphil2Type 1 or LADA,,"Suebca, is 100% correct.
however if you mean when you are in auto mode, do you have suspend on low.  The answer is both yes and no.  The easy answer, no auto suspend is not on when in auto mode.
But, yes, because if the sensor is operating then the pump will suspend at multiple levels but not at a fixed point.  so for instance, i was walking today and my BS was 137, but falling rapidly.
My basal shut off and never notified me.  When I got home and was watching football my blood sugar started back up and basal started again around 82.  Again not at a predetermined level.

In lieu of  a receiver, if you have an Android phone you can most likely  use XDrip+ or Spike for IOS phones.  Both programs are not officially sanctioned by Dexcom but work well with a wide variety of phones.  Alternatively, on Reddit there are a few “hacked” versions of the official Dexcom app that remove the Play store restrictions so the app works with a wider variety of Android phones.

Definitely keep easy to swallow supplies.( especially if beside the bed) for me I started with juice,glucose gummies

What you eat through the day can affect your sleep glucose control. Have the treat early in the day. If I have anything dessert like before bed I will have some hypoglycemia./ trouble sleeping

Claudication symptoms include muscle pain or cramping in your legs or arms that’s triggered by activity, such as walking, but disappears after a few minutes of rest. The location of the pain depends on the location of the clogged or narrowed artery. Calf pain is the most common location.

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350557

In adults, vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, resulting in weak bones [1,5]. Symptoms of bone pain and muscle weakness can indicate inadequate vitamin D levels, but such symptoms can be subtle and go undetected in the initial stages.

Do you get cramping muscles in your calves when you walk, but the cramps stop when you stop walking?  Do your legs frequently get “restless” when you’re not moving around?  And, last question, did the rheumatologist you saw check you out for fibromyalgia?  It’s a special, I guess you’d call it a “touch test”, where they press on various parts of your body to study your reaction.  Thus far, the tender point exam is the only way to diagnose FM, and sadly not all rheumatologists are expert in that.
It took me over three years to get a diagnosis…went through EMG’s, muscle biopsy, what seemed like gazzillions of blood tests.  Finally, I read about FM in a Harvard Health Letter and realized that my symptoms mimicked FM, found a rheumatologist who treats it, and while there’s no cure, I learned how to live with it in a more productive way.  Oh…adding that fatigue is a huge component of FM.
Anyway, that might not be what you have, but don’t give up.  Keep a log of your symptoms, when they happen, what you ate before, how your sleep is, does the weather make things worse or better, etc.  It’s most helpful to doctors when you can describe EXACTLY what brings the symptoms on, what makes them better or worse, etc.  Keep a detailed log for a few weeks, and then go back to the doctor you liked the best and ask for help again.  And, you might want to synopsize your symptoms for us after you track them for a few weeks.

While I’m not the best prayer, I will send you my best wishes and keep you in my thoughts.
While I don’t have extensive experience in this arena, I had two day surgeries over the past 3 years.
I was using a Tandem t:slim and a Dexcom G5 so no closed loop. In my cases, all of the detailed discussion took place with the anesthesiologist … because they are going to be doing the watching. In fact, they taped my receiver (well, my pump) up close to my shoulder where they could easily see it, but it was out of the way.
The wanted to see that I had a reasonable reading going in that was, ideally either flat or slowly rising. While they didn’t give me a number, I was under the impression that 130 mg/dL or higher was their preferred zone. I didn’t have any closed loop at the time so I don’t know what they would say … but I’m betting “no” because they are clearly worried about running low. Maybe others have more relevant closed loop experience. Usually, you don’t get to eat before hand so IOB should not be an issue. As I recall, they asked me to dial back my basal to something like 30-50% of  normal for tge expected duration of tge surgery PLUS recovery.
I don’t know how you will be positioned, but I would do my best to find a sensor location where a compression low is not a possibility. If they saw a drop, they would start a dextrose drip immediately.
As far as supplies, although I don’t have any overnight experience, I’d probably consider an extra sensor, an extra pod, and even syringe/pod backup … who knows what might get pulled off during table to gurney to bed transfers.

I hate being dependent on such drugs, but I know it won’t last.
Went to the general surgeon last week and he said the stomach incision is healing very nicely. Internally he used dissolvable stiches and the a surgical glue with sterri strips, so real easy to care for. He said all I have to do is keep my waist line from rubbing, so any bandage, gauze or whatever I had lying around would work. Monday I go to the back surgeon, but from what I understand he can’t do too much as it is it is too soon for any Xrays/scans. Basically just a pain tolerance visit. And I have a very low tolerance for pain, so I feel like I’m being a baby doing so little.

My husband was not thrilled when I started this little quasi support group (I say quasi, because I am not qualified to lead a real one). To date, he still is not sure about it. He thinks we sit around and ■■■■■ about our
husbands. Quite the contrary. When we're not talking about our kids or our jobs or some other subject, we tell each other stories about what goes on in our lives. We talk about how we handle certain situations and we learn new
things from each other. Best of all, we get each other - we understand how each

I went down that rabbit hole because the logic just doesn’t stand.  If I was an addict, I would not be ordering on Amazon with a CC having them delivered to a home address that has been on file for over 10 years, I would be getting them for free at a shelter. Not to mention, they can see my past purchase history of ordering the same and similar diabetes products.   (As an aside, I hear anecdotally that addicts prefer syringes with 1/2 unit markings for finer control, not that I would actually know).
I asked whom I could speak to about this policy, and met with a stone wall of mindless platitudes and a firm reassurance that they could care less if I used their service or not.  As a customer, I find this galling.  I do understand that Amazon is a behemoth that does not live or die on customer satisfaction anymore or even on my paltry purchases, but I for one am taking my economic opinions elsewhere.",Sep '20

Substitution, finding good healthy food and substituting for bad. For me, fruit, particularly frozen organic pitted cherries, but anything that is really tasty. I love berries and pears, but also apples. Also, tasty for me, organic vegetable medleys, to which I add mild pepper spread, mustard, and soy sauce.

Anyone have any ideas about solving the problem of the lust for garbage carbohydrates


Best description I have heard in years. It is a lust fed by a survival instinct gone amuck.  I dare say that if this errant survival instinct could be tamed we would make great strides into preventing type 2.
The human body was not designed to live in a land of constant plenty. It was designed for times of plenty followed by times of struggle. It is a strong basic instinct that tells us to indulge during times of plenty so that we will survive the times of food struggle.
The intensity of these instincts varies greatly in the human population, local conditions and evolution have made this so.  It is no coincidence that type 2  is seen more often in populations that have traditionally struggled to survive but now no longer struggle.
That was a long winded explanation why many type 2 like @MapleSugar and myself lust for garbage carbs. The problem for her and for me is much more difficult than many members here might be able to understand.  We are not fighting against lack of willpower here, were fighting a basic instinct.
I find that coping skill work best for me, I do something similar to @Timothy.

1944,Garbage carbohydrates in the evenings?,Food,Food,mohe0001,,"Your a garbage eater, @MapleSugar. Can’t change it. Born that way.
I suspect that we might just need to ‘dilute’ delicious things a little, not eliminate them. Maybe like when you mix an adult drink for a teenager. You still want them to feel like an adult, you just mix in a little bit more seltzer water. They’ll never know the difference.
Popcorn is super versatile and can go either way - salty or sweet. Exploit popcorn to greatest advantage. You can pop it yourself and coat it in anything. That keeps it pretty close to healthy.
Less garbage-y garbage ideas:
SWEET
1.) Sherbet with reddi-wip (which is really just air) or coolwhip and walnuts on it
2.) reddi-wip right out of the can
3.) Cornflakes substitute might be (gimmie a moment to negotiate this) grapenuts. I know that they are high carb. But, I find that I can’t eat that much of them without feeling like my jaw is breaking, so that offers some temperance. You can still load them up with sugar and fruit and nuts. You’ll never be able to eat enough of them to hurt you, unless you have the jaws of a hyena. Those sweet or fatty soy/nut milks sometimes have very little sugar on their own and I find that they keep better during these pandemic times.
4.) Diet soda ice cream floats? 1 scoop of ice cream goes a long way in a diet A&W root beer. Diet A&W is one of the best diet pops, I think. But, diet Sunkist orange makes a nice cream soda, too.
SALTY
1.) Nuts. delicious. I have a giant bag of walnuts on my counter than my friends mom got me hooked on - she says walnuts are good for you. I eat them every time I’m standing there. Nuts are best with dried fruit and candy, but I know we gotta limit that stuff. I dilute the fruit and candy with nuts, to a degree that is reasonable, but not excessive.
2.) Taco salad
Do you like Taco salads? I’ve been enjoying a lot of taco salads. It helps dilute the taco with a bit with salad and is still delicious. Plate of chips with melted cheese on top. Then, LOTS of shredded lettuce. Make the lettuce delicious by topping with salsa and sour cream. To further dilute the bad, add (warm) beans to the mix. If there’s enough lettuce, then this works out to be healthy and filling and full of protein (its not much bad stuff - just a little chips and cheese, and some sour cream).
3.) A good spinach or dill dip - goes good on everything, even celery. A good spinach dip makes celery delicious. But, you must have a wide variety of the best veggies to make this good - cherry tomatoes, yellow squash, mushrooms. But, those are too delicate to be filling. You need meaty, fibrous veggies like cauliflower and broccoli. Have some cheese and crackers on the plate, too. Maybe some peanut butter crackers.
The trick to mac and cheese (which has been a pandemic staple here) is to dilute it with broccoli and fresh tomatoes. I like to always dilute noodles with ‘meaty’ vegetables.
I’ve also been mad for crock pot veggie lasagna because its so easy to make. The proportion of veggies to pasta is quite high. There’s actually not a lot of carb in it if your using hearty, ‘meaty’ vegetables like broccoli and zucchini and spinach and yellow squash. Use a good pesto. I made one this morning very quickly. It will last for days.",17d

Why must you stop eating garbage? Is there something that is not working after eating it?


Yes, several things, but one is very important;  Since taking Ozempic (and before that, Victoza) I get extremely unpleasant digestive symptoms when I eat a lot of carbohydrates.

The theory with gluten and grains and autoimmunity is they weaken the gastro lining, leaky gut etc. which results in an attack on the offending particles and eventually the body.
Whether it happens as a result of leaky gut or not I don’t know but I do believe now all those years of IBS caused by reactions to gluten and grains did play a role for me.

I’m in Switzerland now, where even the “big bakeries” (like Reinhard) make all their breads in traditional ways.

It’s some kind of flour conspiracy!

For reasons I can’t empathize with, buttermilk is hard to find in my area of upstate NY. Usually all you can find these days is the small pint sized (?) cartons. A few years back you could still get it by the 1/2 gallon at one of the local grocery stores, but that went away.

This would be very weird for me, but I’m open to eating a different way if it helps my numbers!  I used to be able to eat close to whatever I want and have A1C’s in the 6-7 range (which IMHO is good).  My A1C’s the last couple years are just going up and up, with the latest ones in the mid 9s.  I think if I can find a way to change my dinner time and evening habits, that would be a HUGE start towards better #s, because it’s usually the time of day I eat something carby and then keep snacking all night.  I’m thinking if I eat only protein (and the fat I cook it in) and then no snacking, maybe I can curb that habit and improve a huge portion of my day “in range”.  BUT, with breakfast usually being keifr or cottage cheese, and lunch usually raw veggies with hummus and spoonful’s of nut butter or a salad, my veggie intake will go way down (because that would mean one only meal with veggies a day).  What do people think?  Will I be missing too many nutrients?  All these food guidelines/requirements/specific diets are at odds with each other and I just want to make sure I’m getting what I need in a day, but not at the expense of my blood sugar control!

You can easily do this experiment and then watch your BG numbers. I try to eat my final meal of the day at 3:00 p.m. and avoid snacks in the evening. I eat some vegetables most days but think they are not as nutritionally important as some people think. Let your meter be your guide.
If you eat primarily protein and fat for your last meal of the day, you can adjust your insulin dose based on that nutrition profile, so that you minimize the delayed BG rises if you only dose based on carbs.
I have been following people who identify as carnivores and only eat animal products. I haven’t converted to this way of eating yet but I do think it’s nutritionally sound and sustainable.

I started eating low carb, high protein 20 years ago and it worked wonders for reducing my insulin usage and leveling out my blood sugars, as well as helped me lose weight. Over time, I removed simple carbs, and the bread that I primarily eat is now whole rye cracker, one of the few ‘breads’ with a low-glycemic index.

This is my favorite line of thought when it comes to food.  People are always looking for a shortcut to fastest results, which seems to contain inevitable short-comings… And in some cases, dangers.  Any sort of extreme diet scares me.  Unfortunately, finding balance is difficult in a world where carbohydrates are delicious, cheap, readily available, and shelf-stable and the media is always trying to sell us on a new extreme.
@jenni_bean  I haven’t seen any mention of type or treatment.   I’ve gotten the impression that you’re a type 2, just because of no mention of meal-time boluses.  True?  I’m wondering if you’re trying to control by diet and exercise alone, or if you’re taking any medication.
Besides some nighttime indulgences, it doesn’t seem like you’re eating a bad balance at all.  It doesn’t seem like you should have to go to the extreme of cutting out everything but meat and fat from your evening meal.  It’s like you skipped the idea of limiting your carb indulgence and jumped right to the far extreme on the diet scale.
It strikes me as if you need to talk to your doctor about adding to or adjusting your medication if you’re to the point you feel like you can’t eat a reasonable, balanced meal anymore.
I’ve gotten the impression that many Type 2s are reluctant to add medication to their diet/exercise regime.  Like they feel they somehow failed at being diabetic if they need more help.  Short of STIs, I don’t know if any other illness that comes with so much stigma.  There are so many treatment options to try, and no shame in any of them.

Oh, please don’t do that. None of us is perfect. The late night snacking could mean you are lacking some nutrient and your body is urging you to ingest it. But nutrition is difficult. We don’t always know what our body needs.
Someone also mentioned try doing something at night that gets your mind off of food. Not easy if that is what the body wants! I don’t have any good suggestions but you’ve come up with some good ones. Besides working out like rower or walking, reading a good book, or other fun mental tasks, may work to preoccupy your mind.
I know for me personally every season causes a transition. Winter causes my body to crave food and I inevitably gain a few pounds before I transition to the new season. Maybe that is happening to you, too? Maybe your body actually needs the extra fat for winter. I feel that is the case for me.

On one had, you need to be honest to yourself about what you are eating. Bite the bullet, tell yourself that you are going to eat the whole thing, and then control for it, with proper insulin amounts. Not ideal, but at least your blood sugar will be okay, and that’s particularly important to avoid complications from the virus.
On the other hand, you want to get your eating under control, ideally without exercising will power. Pardon if I tell you things you likely already know or already do. Don’t buy your problematic foods in the first place, so, when you purchase food, do so on a full stomach. Stick to a list of good foods. Don’t buy ‘bad’ snacks. If you do buy ‘bad’ snacks, don’t leave them on the counter. Try to buy healthy snacks in prepackaged amounts, so beside fruit or veg, have SMALL packets of nuts, dried fruit, or figs. Don’t buy the bulk bag. Also, as discussed, find something that your enjoy to fill you time.
As to the last point, I often choose activities that are a little obsessive for me. If it keeps me engaged too much, that is what I want. I had mental health issues when I was younger, and I found that intense focus solves a problem that I had, so when I find something that makes me forget to eat, I keep it. When I was younger, simply talking to a woman could do that. Programming is/was one of those things, and when I first decided ot build a website, I did so on a staycation, woke, started coding at 8 AM, had a Häagen-Dazs sorbet for lunch, and then kept programmin until 5 PM, at which time I would go out for dinner and some activities in Manhattan.

I suggest you pick up a bottle of MCT oil to help you slide into ketosis far faster. MCT’s are medium chain triglycerides, which are near-instantly digested and sent to the liver where they produce low levels of ketones (yes, you want ketones in your bloodstream, they are your new fuel now that you’re not consuming carbs).
Once you’re more fully into ketosis, you can back way off on the MCT oil, as all your ketones will be produced from metabolized body fats.
IMPORTANT - There are suggestions all over the internet to “take a tablespoon or 2 of  MCT oil”. I’m warning you right now not to do this, as it turns out MCT oil is a far more powerful laxative than anything on the market. Less than a teaspoon (perhaps every morning or evening) is all I’d take. It also can cause severe stomach cramps when taken initially so don’t start too quickly.

 ArcherAidan:

type 1s aren’t able to process ketones properly. Thoughts on this article?


Here’s the paragraph that likely informed your comment.

People with type 1 diabetes should not try to achieve ketosis through the ketogenic diet or otherwise. Because people with type 1 diabetes don’t have insulin, they cannot metabolize ketones, which are gradually flushed through urine in people without the disease. For people with type 1 diabetes, ketosis can result in an accumulation of ketone acids in their bloodstream known as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), says Dr. Greenfield.

This is nonsense! People with type 1 diabetes  can process ketones as energy just like gluco-normals do. I say this because I have successfully utilized a low-carb, high-fat diet for the last 6+ years and spend much time in healthy ketosis.
This Dr. Greenfield embarrassingly suffers a common confusion about ketosis vs. diabetic ketoacidosis. The rest of the cited article makes this distinction between ketosis and DKA very well, more than once. Dr. Greenfield’s quote is not factually correct. Ketones can be metabolized by most tissues in the body and the brain can run quite happily on ketones. Not all ketones are flushed out by the kidneys.
People with T1D do take exogenous insulin. Perhaps the good doctor was talking about DKA that precedes initial diagnosis when T1Ds do not have any native or external insulin added.
As I’ve written before about the difference between ketosis and DKA is like the difference between a light breeze and hurricane force winds. Many medical professionals have historically confused these two different states, especially in the dietitian ranks. I must note that this is improving but Dr. Greenfield reminds me that this confusion is still muddying the waters for many patients.",Feb '19

I did have one episode where I was going into DKA with normal BG numbers (I was between 110 to 120 at the time.)
I got myself out of it before I had to go to the emergency room (even though I probably should have went,) by eating carbs and large doses of insulin.
I didn’t have a full grasp on being type 1 yet, and how my body worked. But I was blindly going by my BG numbers to guess how I was doing.

I’ve never had such accurate delivery of insulin to balance out the carbs I’d get thru various IV’s.   I switched docs when I no longer worked near him, but I have nothing but good to say about him other than he was ALWAYS very late for appointments.  Sometimes more than 2.5 hours late.   Say what you will, he is one of the best endos in the South Bay.
And I disagree with your statement that Greenfield is incorrect.   https://www.healthline.com/health/ketosis-vs-ketoacidosis#diagnosis 5",Feb '19
2042,Interesting read on the ketogenic diet,Food,Food,Terry4,3,"After writing my criticism of Dr. Greenfield’s quote in the linked article, I should have raised this point. The doctor may have been misquoted by the journalist. If he was then my criticism may be based on incorrect reportiing.
What point, specifically do you disagree with me?


Is it the point that people ""with type 1 diabetes should not try to achieve ketosis through the ketogenic diet or otherwise?


Do you disagree with my assertion that “people with T1D do have insulin” since they must take it to survive?


Do you think that all instances of ketosis lead to DKA?


Your personal experience with Dr. Greenfield paints a much different picture than the article did. If the doctor’s position was mis-portrayed by the article writer, then that left me with a skewed sense of his competence.
I have read many accounts from professional medicos who don’t understand that ketosis is a daily fact of life for almost all people. It’s how our body compensates for lack of food when we sleep for eight hours and don’t eat. The demonizaton of ketosis is often asserted by professionals who support the low-fat and highly processed carb diets, the standard American diet or SAD.",Feb '19

type 1s aren’t able to process ketones properly.


The article, especially the statement “Type 1s aren’t able to process ketones properly” is absolutely false, and there are 100’s if not 1,000’s of keto practicing T1D MD’s that dispel this old fashioned myth. Perhaps as Terry suggested the good doctor was misquoted?
More to the point, T1D’s are more readily able to control their ketone level with proper blood glucose than T2’s, as T1’s can monitor their BG and inject (pump) the lowest possible insulin levels required to maintain target blood sugars. Insulin is effective at doing 3 things: metabolizing glucose, storing excess energy as fat, and lastly putting the brakes on rising ketones.
If insulin is high, ketone production (ketogenesis) is blocked. If insulin is low, ketone production is increased.

In my daily reading I do about diabetes and health, I have come across an eating tactic for diabetes that made zero sense to me yet people with type 1 diabetes claim it works very well for them. They say that the key is minimizing fat so that your body can greatly increase its insulin sensitivity and enable the insulin you do take to metabolize more carbs. This diet includes no meats.
My initial take on this whole idea was extreme skepticism, but I keep running across different cases where people are claiming that it not only helps with their blood sugar control, but they also feel healthy in a comprehensive way. My thinking now is, given the variety of human metabolisms, this high-carb low-fat or HCLF can work in some people.

400 - 500 g of carbs a day and average total daily dose of insulin 15 to 20 units


This amazes me. I wonder if this phenomena holds true with a wide swath of diabetics or is simply occurs due to a spectrum of human metabolism performance.
If you occasionally slip some higher fat content into your eating routine, does that immediately degrade your insulin to high carb ratio or is this metabolic measure slow to change?
Considering your insulin to carb ratio (I:C) hinted at with possibly 500 grams of carbs being metabolized with 10 units of insulin (guessing 1/2 of 20 units total daily dose), then your I:C is an astounding 1:50. Is that true for you or any others who use LFHC as a way of eating?
I know when I adopted a LCHF way of eating there were many people who remained skeptical that this could work and didn’t want to try it for themselves. This is still true today. I guess I would have to read many more accounts of long term blood glucose success with this way of eating before I might give it a try. I am enjoying great BG control with my current LCHF way of eating and it takes very little to no willpower to sustain.
Thanks for reporting your experience. If any of you who enjoy this way of eating (LFHC), I would love to see some post-meal BG graphs traced by a CGM or even a series of fingersticks. Seeing this kind of anecdotal evidence would be persuasive to me.",Aug '18

I don’t eat HCLF, more like moderate carb (~100g) and moderate fat, but I have noticed a difference in my insulin dosing based on how much fat I eat. With LCHF my I:C ratio is about 1:5, but on a lower fat diet it’s about 1:15. For me it takes a couple days of eating low fat for my insulin sensitivity to improve, but only a high fat meal or two to see an increase in insulin resistance.

I think that part of the problem may be with another hormone rarely if ever discussed called amylin.  you need to eat as many vegetables as possible.  perhaps green smoothies could be the answer.  more on amylin:
How it works
As most people with diabetes already know, insulin helps transfer glucose out of the bloodstream and into the body’s cells. It is produced by a group of cells in the pancreas called beta cells. But beta cells secrete more than just insulin; they also secrete amylin. People with Type 1 diabetes, whose beta cells have been destroyed by the body’s immune system, secrete no amylin at all. And people with Type 2 diabetes who have progressed to the point of needing insulin injections (or infusions from a pump) have limited beta cell capacity and thus produce insufficient amylin.
So why all the fuss about amylin? Those of us with diabetes have survived for years without it. But the goal, of course, is more than just survival. It is to manage blood glucose levels effectively so that we feel good, can perform our daily routines, and live long, healthy, productive lives. The natural hormone amylin, as well as its synthetic equivalent, pramlintide (available since 2005 under the brand name Symlin), helps improve blood glucose control after meals. It does this by prompting the following actions:
Slowing digestion. Amylin slows gastric emptying, or movement of food from the stomach into the intestines. When carbohydrates stay in the stomach longer, they are converted to glucose and enter the bloodstream in a slower, more gradual manner.

Blocking glucagon secretion. Glucagon is a pancreatic hormone that raises the blood glucose level by stimulating the liver to release stored glucose. It is usually secreted in response to stress or hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). Without amylin, most people with diabetes produce extra glucagon when they eat; this can contribute to after-meal blood glucose spikes. When taken with meals, Symlin suppresses the inappropriate release of glucagon by the pancreas.

Enhancing satiety (the feeling of fullness). By helping to limit appetite and thus reduce the amount of food eaten during (and between) meals, amylin limits the potential for huge blood glucose",Feb '16

2094,Gastroparesis and type 1 diabetes,Food,Food,flippingbean,,"I’m not T1D (just prediabetic) and my triggers of GP are probably different from yours but the ONE THING that helped me the most was NOT DRINKING WATER before, during, and just after a meal, and chewing more slowly. The theory is that the water that you drink with your meal dilutes your stomach acid so your “digesting power” gets weakened. chewing more slowly invites more saliva to go down with your food so your stomach recognizes it as something it needs to digest. Soup is still ok for whatever reason even though it has water in it. I used to have GP a few times a month, some months more, some months none. since I stopped drinking water with meals in 2016, I can count on my hands the number of episodes I’ve had (and can almost always trace it to a trigger, whereas pre-2016 it just happened randomly)
Sometimes, when I start to feel its onset, I can avert an episode by stopping to put anything in my mouth (not even water) and putting a hot water bottle on my belly to coax my stomach to relax while I go take a nap/sleep for the night. If I manage to sleep through it, then I’m saved. If my measures didn’t work, the pain gets worse and I’ll have to vomit in the wee hours to get rid of my breakfast/lunch, it usually takes a whole hour of vomiting to get rid of absolutely everything (and even if there is half lentil left in there, the pain won’t relent!) I realize it’s harder to do my method of aversion when you have full on diabetes and need to watch your BGL dropping too low.
my triggers don’t always trigger, but every time I’ve had an episode, one or a combination of the following were involved:
processed foods esp fatty+sweet processed foods
(probably some additives confusing my stomach)
unsprouted legumes/pulses in large quantity
tough beef in large quantity
coated vitamins (gels capsules were ok, probably the coating confused my stomach)
poor sleep the night before.
My first ever episode 17 years ago was when I ate Milano while doing college apps at 2am. (combo of crappy sleep and processed sweet/fatty food)",Nov '20

I have been told to do a liquid diet for a short period of time if symptoms are bad and then work up to soft foods.  I can try to find information if you haven’t gotten all of this already.  I think the biggest thing that helps is small meals and moving to an insulin pump/trying to better control blood sugars.
You are right though.  You have to eliminate some healthier foods because they take longer to digest and can cause symptoms.",Nov '20
2096,Night hypos due to evening exercise,Food,Food,pancreaswanted,,"Hello all,
I am having a problem with overnight hypos, at all times of the night-sometimes between the typical midnight to 3am slot, but also later on towards dawn.
I do my exercise in the evening, most of the time a run, a long walk, dynamic (not relaxing) yoga or training session with my running group, lasting an hour and a half of strength and sprint/series/changes of rhythm runs. I finish between 7pm and 830pm.
I get home, shower and have dinner, which is always 100gr of full-fat, Greek yoghurt with walnuts. (I live in Spain, we eat a bigger lunch and smaller dinner, also aiming, with help of a shrink, to never skip any meals and we decided this dinner I can do-bit of disordered eating going on, but working on fixing it.)
I have lowered my basal from .85-.80 from midnight to 0230am on the advice of my endo and if my bg is on the low side, under 100, i will lower my basal to 80% for the whole night, but if it is 150 going to bed, like last night, I don´t want to put a lowered basal. (Sometimes I finish very intense workouts high.)
I am looking to see if anyone else exercises at this time and has these problems with hypos and if you have a specific food that you eat that helps combat them. the yogurt has the three macronutrients and the walnuts are fat and some protein, so I am expecting them to keep me high enough to go through the night if I can´t lower the basal when I am higher at bedtime. Or just further experiment with lowering basal.
Thanks in advance!",Nov '20

I guess that we can make an exception  I have also discovered a huge degree of diversity on this question.
For me, it clearly depends on one variable: the ripeness of the banana.
IF the banana is really ripe, then it’s like eating pure sugar. If the banana is not so ripe (i.e. hard), I just bolus for the correct amount of carbs (20g for a small banana, 35g for a large banana).

2118,*The Banana Studies*,Food,Food,Kristin2,1,"I did a little Google-ing myself and found this:
“The glycemic index (GI) of bananas varies depending upon how ripe the bananas are. This is because a lot of the carbohydrate in green bananas is in the form of a kind of resistant starch which we lack the enzyme to digest. As the fruit ripens, the starch is converted into readily available sugars.”
So basically, in my almost green bananas, there are “resistant starches” that I do not digest (and hence do not raise my blood sugar). Whereas I digest all the carbs from ripe bananas.

Last week I found a copy of “Dr. Anderson’s Life-Saving Diet: The New High-Fiber, Low Cholesterol Way to Keep Slim & Stay Healthy.” Dr. Anderson was, or still is Director of the Diabetes Service at the Veternans Administration Medical Service, here in Lexington, Ky. The copy I have was published in 1986, but some of his research goes back to the seventies.
Below is a summary of one of his studies with diabetes and diet:
Researchers in Lexington Kentucky found that many diabetics on a low-fat, high complex carbohydrate diet (fruits, veggies, whole grains) containing generous amounts of roughage or fiber could eliminate the need for insulin injections and other drugs. James Anderson, MD, chief of the endocrine metabolism section at the Veterans Administration Hospital, over several years placed more than 1,000 adult diabetics on special diets containing foods rich in high-fiber fruits and vegetables like oranges, grapefruit and apples, and high fiber oat bran, oatmeal, beans, psyllium and soy fiber. All the patients benefited and 2/3 stop taking daily insulin injections. (–Post Graduate Medicine, Aug. 1990).
From my net searching, he is very well known for his research on fiber in the diet and especially for promoting oat bran. He teaches, or taught, medicine and clinical nutrition in the medical school at UK in addition to his research . He also wrote a book on the high fiber diet for diabetes. I found some used copies on the net and should be getting them. The diet looks very complete nutritionally. In his research in Lexington, the high fiber, high carbohydrate diet also lowered blood pressure. I’m looking for more of his research and am interested in what others think and have tried.",Jan '10

I eat a low carb diet that’s high fiber. My meals contain a lot of low carb veggies, so that’s a good amount of fiber to start with. I also eat nuts (very good fats) & use almond meal, golden flaxseed meal & coconut flour for baking, additional fiber. I don’t eat grains because they send me soaring.
I don’t eat soy products because I have thyroid problems, like many diabetics. Soy is antagonistic to the thyroid gland.
As a Type 1, I haven’t found that high fiber particularly helps BG. It slows digestion & this would be more helpful for T2s & your diagnosis of pre-diabetes. On insulin you don’t necessarily want to slow digestion because of timing of insulin to digestion, though fiber is important & healthy.
There’s a lot of progressive research you can search that links bad lipid profiles & heart disease to high carb intake, not fat. High carb/low fat isn’t necessarily healthy at all. My lipids improved greatly when I cut the carbs & others have experienced the same. My diet is high fat–nuts, cheese, avocadoes.

I’m afraid this outdated diet might kill me…well maybe not kill me…it would be ugly though. Oatmeal is good for you right…I used to eat it every morning even after dx (old fashioned round blue box cook on the stove top). Until I started testing everything that I ate and discovered that, for me (I can only speak for my experience), oatmeal made my bs soar and because it is high fiber, my bs stayed high for an extended amount of time.
My testing also revealed that (FOR ME) most high fiber (whole grains, bran, legumes, beans etc.) makes my bs soar and because of the high-fiber beneficial side to slowing down digestion, it keeps my bs high for a long time. So high-fiber is good for most…just not for this T2 diabetic. I do take a 500 mg psyllium capsule every day since this is an insoluble fiber and will not affect bs.
Fruit…ahh…I love fruit…unfortunately it is basically sugar…I can’t even eat 1/2 of a banana without bad results.

…the bottom line is this…there is no bottom line because it is complicated.
You have to find what works for you…foods that cause problems for me may not be a problem for you…so experiment and test your bs often.

2155,What is the DASH diet?,Food,Food,MilaStaff,1," What is the DASH diet? 1
The DASH diet —  D ietary  A pproaches to  S top  H ypertension — is a nutrition plan that promotes heart-healthy foods. Similar to the Mediterranean Diet 2, the plan recommends eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, along with sources of lean protein, such as fish and poultry, and healthier fats like beans, nuts, and vegetable oils. It also recommends the consumption of fat-free or low-fat dairy options.
One of the goals of the diet is to limit the intake of foods with significant amounts of sugar, sodium, and saturated fat. Ideally, less than 10% of your daily caloric intake should be allotted for each. The primary goal of the DASH diet is to help lower high blood pressure.
Recommendations for the DASH Diet
Here’s what a day following the DASH diet, based on a 2,000-calorie plan would look like:

4 to 5 servings of vegetables
4 to 5 servings of fruits
6 to 8 servings of whole grains
2 to 3 servings of dairy
6 or fewer servings of lean meats, poultry or fish — 1 ounce per serving
2 to 3 servings of fats and oils — healthy options for fats include avocados, low-fat cheese, and yogurt, dark chocolate, nuts, olive oil.

The following amounts are suggested per week:

4 to 5 servings of nuts, seeds, and legumes
5 or fewer servings of sweets

What about alcohol and caffeine you ask? The diet doesn’t mention caffeine due to the lack of evidence on the effect of caffeine on blood pressure. But, alcohol consumption should be done in moderation.
Why DASH? Research Shows It’s Effectiveness
People adopt the DASH diet because it can reduce hypertension or high blood pressure. High blood pressure is one of the risk factors of Type 2 diabetes. However, the DASH diet’s benefits aren’t singular to hypertension. When you eat this diet, you’re also consuming nutrient-rich foods in calcium, potassium, and magnesium.
It can also improve blood sugar, improve insulin sensitivity, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), and promote weight loss — all of which decrease the risks of Type 2 diabetes and are conducive to diabetes management.
Several studies show the effectiveness of the DASH diet in regards to Type 2 diabetes, whether it’s to possibly prevent it from occurring or reducing the risk of health complications in those who already have it. While there is  not  one diet, in particular, that is specifically recommended for the prevention of Type 2 diabetes, the DASH diet has been associated with a 20% reduced risk for being diagnosed with Type 2 in the future. For those who already have diabetes, DASH has been cited to help increase insulin sensitivity, especially in conjunction with exercise and weight loss.
Pros and Cons of the DASH Diet
Pros:
Easy to Begin  – No special, particularly expensive, or hard to access foods or supplements are required to partake in the DASH diet
Flexibility  – Easy to sustain and there are no real restrictions, but rather it’s recommended to eat small amounts of things like red meat, sweets, and fats
Healthy and Nutritious  – This diet promotes the consumption of nutrient-dense foods filled with an array of the vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients we need for optimal health. It doesn’t call for the restriction of whole grains, fruits, or legumes. Though the diet promotes a healthy way of eating, it doesn’t specifically prohibit indulgences such as sweets, however, it does advise limited consumption of them.
Clinically-Supported  – Supporting research shows this diet has can prevent Type 2 diabetes, help manage it better, and reduce the risks of high blood pressure. These factors reduce the chances of having a heart attack or a stroke. It’s also endorsed by major health institutions such as the American Heart Association, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the USDA.
Cons:
Convenience  – This isn’t a commercialize diet, meaning, you can’t find a meal service  specifically  for this diet. However, you can find DASH-diet friendly meal services that promote low-sodium meals.
Weight Loss  – This diet isn’t designed specifically for quick and dramatic weight loss, but it can result in weight loss over time when combined with exercise and a diet that promotes a deficit in calories.
Support Groups  –  Unlike national centralized support groups like Weight Watchers, there isn’t an equivalent for the DASH diet. However, there are online groups on social media that can provide peer support.
Overall, there are no true negatives to this diet health-wise, it is a diet that promotes choosing the healthiest food when presented with options, it is also a diet that is absolutely fit for the whole family, not just those with diabetes. Some people regularly eat within the DASH specifications without realizing it.",Mar '19

My doctor wants me to eat 25 g of carbs or less per meal, which at this time I usually go over slightly.   It is extremely hard to stay under 25 g of carbs, but if I get up in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 carbs, my blood sugar can shoot up over 200.  After going over 200, my blood sugar then drops, sometimes below 70 (I am not on any meds). I have a very sensitive stomach due to having Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. I’m very, very lactose intolerant… Two slices of pizza require two Lactaid pills, and I still have a little trouble (not that pizza is a good idea for someone with blood sugar issues, but just an example).  I’m on a fairly limited budget, and don’t have a lot of money to spend on trial and error, so I would greatly appreciate any advice that you guys have.
First of all, what fruits are good for someone with blood sugar issues? Which ones do not raise blood sugar too drastically?
Secondly, foods that are healthy tend to bother my stomach, unfortunately. One thing I am interested in is finding (simple) recipes/combinations of foods that I could purée either into a smoothie or a drinkable soup.

You can puree anything really. It’s just some things don’t taste the same. I remember pureeing lasagna for my brother when he had his jaw wired shut so he could drink it through a straw and it wasn’t the same at all.

2165,Food ideas for sensitive stomach,Food,Food,Robyn_H,2,"I feel like you’re trying to learn how to eat carbs without stressing your blood sugar too badly, because it’s one of the few things you tonette right now. Correct?
Do you bake, or think you would enjoy learning? I’ve long since accepted that I just do better with some carb in my diet, despite being diabetic.  Nothing is happier to my stomach than bread.  The number one thing they tell diabetics to avoid.  Thankfully, beefing type 1 myself, I can bolus for it, but you still have some options…
Thanks to the pandemic and the weird shortage of yeast in the grocery store, I took to making naturally leavened “sourdough” bread instead.  The quotes around sourdough are because naturally leavened bread doesn’t actually have to taste sour.  The sour is by choice from using a very old starter and/or adding dairy to it.  I’ve been absolutely in awe about the difference in how my blood sugar reacts to naturally leavened, slow rise bread vs generic white bread.  If you give the yeast enough time, they actually digest most of the carb in the flour for you.
Not to mention flour and water are about as cheap as food can come…
If you’re not up to baking yourself, or not willing to learn, then it might be worth sourcing a good local bakery and asking about any slow-risen bread they have.  Don’t buy Sourdough at the grocery store, it’s not the same thing.
In my opinion, a slice of bread with butter can make even a bland low-glycemic soup feel like a real satisfying treat.
Also, have you tried spiraled vegetable recipes? Even a starchy vegetable “pasta” can be eaten in moderate portions and still stay within your carb allotment.  I like spiraling, too, because it makes a small amount of potato look like a mountain.  It tricks you into being satisfied. An average potato has about 37 g of carb, a little over your budget, but not much.  If you had a kitchen scale you could actually weigh out how much would be equal to 25 g of carb. (68 g of potato contains 25 g carbohydrate).
This is my favorite website for spiralizer recipes:
https://inspiralized.com/recipe-index/ 1
She’s really amazing with lower-carb comfort foods.  The recipe index I linked to has the option to sort by vegetable or fruit, so you can just look at the starchy, happy belly vegetables if you want
Personally I loathe zucchini noodle recipes   They just don’t push the pasta button for me.  But give me a pile of sweet potato noodles and I’m just in heaven.
I do actually have her spiraluzer, too, but you don’t need it to use her recipes.  You can get a julienne peeler (looks like a regular potato peeler, but has lots of little extra perpendicular blades to slice each piece of peel into smaller pieces) at Walmart stupid cheap and still make “spiralizer” recipes.

2166,Food ideas for sensitive stomach,Food,Food,cardamom,6,"Hi, fellow EDSer here. Do you know if you have mast cell activation syndrome, MCAS, which is super common in EDS and usually the cause of related GI issues? If you do, a lot of the advice here and from your doctor may not be good for you, because you may need to eat low histamine. It’s hard to do that and eat low carb, but not impossible, but it may be a reason to consider asking for other treatment options besides diet.
For example, greek yogurt, or any yogurt, may be tricky since that can be high in histamines and may cause GI upset, but it might work for you and it may depend specifically on the cultures used. In general, I would look up low histamine diets and try to avoid anything cultured, aged, fermented, pickled, as well as tomatoes, strawberries, avocados, most nuts (esp walnuts and cashews, almonds may be ok) and peanuts, bananas, olives, any cured meats or significantly aged steak, aged cheese, any leftover meats, shellfish, fish that isn’t super super fresh (flash frozen is actually safest). No alcohol (esp beer/wine), and be careful with vinegar (I find white or apple cider is ok, but wine or balsamic is bad). Some folks can’t tolerate dark chocolate or citrus. For a lot of these, I know I can eat limited amounts (like a bit of avocado), but if I eat a lot I will regret it, and because it’s a levels thing, they also add up together. Some stuff is so bad though (fish sauce, fermented stuff, walnuts, strawberries) even a tiny bit is a non-starter.

Can you consider adding nuts - from peanuts to almonds to pistachios.  Not super high carb, but good protein, quick snack.  I also keep hard boiled eggs on hand to eat with some salt or to add to a salad. Frozen chicken can heat up quickly and is great with a salad or veg.  If you really crave grains, try those with lots of fibre which should help with blood glucose.  I often have barley or groats (also called kasha) with mushrooms and/or beans and/or onions. In spite of the carb counts the fibre helps keep glucose steady.  Wild rice takes longer to cook, has a lovely nutty flavour and crunch; avoid plain white rice if you can. When i cook i make lots for leftovers and quick snacks. Grains aren’t super expensive, and reheat easily. Try quinoa too.  (Not something i like, but many do.)  Frozen fish can be reasonably priced, cooks fast and has gotten way better over the years.  Easy to dress up with herbs/spices, a bit of mayo or olive oil, or even some panko bread crumbs to add a little crunch.

It has improved my starch tolerance tremendously. It helped my FBG (99 to 85) and 2 hour post prandial BG (120 to 90). After starting inulin (another prebiotic), and taking some soil based probiotics, my 1 hr post prandial is starting to improve too (156 to 109 after a 4oz potato).RS feeds gut flora which seems to play a big role in BG regulation (think incretins, for example):http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3830370/ 6There are several type 2 RS anecdotes if you follow the links in the first link.I urge you guys to try it on yourselves and see.

Well, I’m not sure Dr Google is doing you any favors here. Dermatological symptoms can be D-related, but are hardly the first thing you’d look for that would make you leap to a D or pre-D diagnosis. It’s easy enough to check, though. Head to a pharmacy and buy an OTC blood sugar tester (they’re pretty cheap) and do a few finger sticks. In particular, do one first thing in the a.m. before you eat to get a fasting level. If it’s consistently in the range of 100-125 mg/dl over a week or so you should consider going to a doctor for more testing and a real diagnosis. But your age and body type don’t suggest type 2, and you don’t mention any of the classical symptoms of type 1 (unexplained weight loss, ravenous thirst and excessive urination), so I wouldn’t be overly concerned unless a BG meter suggests otherwise.
OTOH, it might be that the skin problem IS a symptom of something dietary or nutritional—that connection is a lot more common. Your digestive problems with meat could indicate something along those lines (not that everyone needs to eat meat). If the treatment you received doesn’t seem to be working it would definitely be something to go back to your dermatologist and ask about.",Dec '19

So I’ve come to ask, what way of eating works the best for you in gaining good control?
There are so many things that work for different people, and I’m open to everything. I definitely have done my research on what’s “best” or “healthiest” but I honestly think everyone has to do what works best for them.

I’ve found that the diet matters less than the way you dose for the food you eat. When eating high glycemic index foods, prebolus by 30 minutes or so. When eating low glycemic index foods, dose when you start to eat them.  When eating foods with lots of protein/fat, you may want to dose again 2 hours later. The timing varies quite a bit from person to person, but I’d say that the timing and the amount of insulin is the most critical.
Also, Sometimes I might find myself wanting to eat a high glycemic index food and I don’t have the time to prebolus.

Prior to that I bought into the idea to eat what I want and just dose for it. I really liked this idea! I tried for years, decades really, to make that work.
Since managing using a carb limited diet for the last six years, I’ve discovered that insulin doses, food, and my BGs behaved in relatively predictable ways if I consumed under 75 or 100 grams of carbs per day. Once I exceeded that level, all my diabetes formulas just stopped working. It was like pushing rope; it just couldn’t get the job done in any predictable way. Your diabetes may vary, of course.
I eat two main meals per day, a late breakfast and an early dinner. This incorporates up to a 16-hours per day fast. I think this eating style and rhythm helps keep my insulin sensitivity in place. I eat eggs, cheese, nuts, low carb veggies, berries, heavy cream, beef, pork, lamb, and fish. I limit bread, potatoes, noodles, and rice.
I often spend greater than 90% of my time-in-range 65-140 mg/dL (3.6-7.8 mmol/L) with low BG variability. Here’s  a 24-hour trace of a good day, not typical, but not too far off.

You can’t draw any firm conclusions about blood glucose and complications except to say that better glucose control reduces the risk of complications.  There are no absolute guarantees. But when you think about it, gluco-normals don’t have health guarantees, either!

Also, in terms of determining if a food qualifies for really wanting it, I try to do a one bite test when I can, especially if I’m at a party or event with trays of tempting sweets or such—take one bite of the carb-y thing and then pause and really think about if I want more, and give myself permission to throw out the rest of the cookie or whatever if it’s not in fact as awesome as it looked (which ends up being a lot of the time).
Also, if my diabetes control has gotten out of whack, I will sometimes do a reset by eating stricter LCHF/keto for a little bit to just remove the carb variance entirely—it’s not a diet I find sustainable longterm for myself, but it can be helpful as a calibration of sorts.",Mar '18

2257,GetInsulin.org Addresses Immediate Needs of People Struggling to Access Insulin,Treatment,Treatment,MilaStaff,3,"SAN CARLOS, Calif., Oct. 5, 2020  /PRNewswire/ – A new tool for anyone in the United States struggling to access life-sustaining insulin launched today at GetInsulin.org 16. Created by global diabetes nonprofit organization Beyond Type 1, GetInsulin.org 16 connects people with diabetes who take insulin to assistance programs and low-cost solutions that match their unique situation.
Insulin is a life-essential medicine for over seven million people with diabetes living in the US today. The list price is high, and not taking insulin is not an option. GetInsulin.org 16 is an important resource for people who need help affording their insulin today.
On GetInsulin.org 16, users answer a few questions (such as location, insurance type, income, and type of insulin they take) then receive customized action plans to guide them through the access solutions and next steps needed. The site and plan details are available in English and Spanish, can be downloaded or emailed, with the option for follow-up reminders when life changes may happen.
GetInsulin.org 16 is supported by a coalition of partners helping connect those in need to lower-cost insulin now, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists (ADCES), the Endocrine Society, Feeding America, JDRF, The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the National Hispanic Medical Association (NHMA). GetInsulin.org 16 is funded by Lilly, Mylan, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi.
People with diabetes in the United States face serious health complications or death when they cannot access insulin. Since 2013, the list price of insulin has skyrocketed, leaving people without health insurance or on high-deductible insurance plans paying out-of-pocket upwards of $1,000 for a one-month supply of insulin, often unaware of assistance options. This is the result of a unique drug pricing crisis going on in the United States that will require widespread healthcare reform to bring list prices down.
“Insulin is not optional for people with diabetes. The current drug pricing system that leaves many unsure of how to access their insulin needs to change, and that change will take time. Right now there are assistance options out there for many struggling to access insulin, but individuals may not know about programs or those programs may be difficult to navigate,” said Beyond Type 1 CEO Thom Scher. “GetInsulin.org 16 is designed to address this immediate and solvable problem - to simplify the process of getting people to the right help and getting them access to insulin in the immediate term.”
Beyond Type 1 advocates for high quality, modern insulin to be available to people with diabetes regardless of employment or insurance status, across all demographics, without barriers, and at an affordable and predictable price point. Until that is achieved, GetInsulin.org 16 will be a resource for those needing access to insulin options immediately.
“The American Diabetes Association is honored to partner with Beyond Type 1 and the coalition of organizations committed to raising awareness of GetInsulin.org 16, a critical tool for people who need insulin right now,” said Tracey D. Brown, CEO of the ADA. “We need to both connect people to life-saving solutions today, and work towards a system that doesn’t leave so many in need of help accessing a drug they need to stay alive.”
If you or someone you love is struggling to access insulin, go to GetInsulin.org 7.
About Beyond Type 1

2258,GetInsulin.org Addresses Immediate Needs of People Struggling to Access Insulin,Treatment,Treatment,mohe0001,1,"This is specific to insulin access in Minnesota. But, even if your not in MN, I think that the lawsuit between Pharma and the State is pretty interesting.
Greetings #insulin4all members,
Since the enactment of The Alec Smith Emergency Insulin Act, we have heard from many who have successfully utilized it. We are ecstatic to see this law helping those in need! A reminder to please visit MNinsulin.org 1 to check for eligibility, and find other important information about the Insulin Safety Net Program here in Minnesota. We understand that there has been some obstacles and challenges for some with the application process. If you are experiencing any difficulties with the application process or pharmacy compliance there are many ways we can help. Please reach out to one of our Minnesota #insulin4all executive members via our Facebook Page, or by email at mninsulin4all@t1international.com
As some of you may have heard, on the evening just prior to Alec Smith’s Act becoming law, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) filed a lawsuit against the state of Minnesota to overturn this critical bill. The lawsuit itself did not prevent the bill from becoming law. With the help of National Health Law Program (NHeLP), Minnesota advocates, T1International, and Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid (MMLA), an amicus brief was flied to uphold this law. You can find more about the brief and terms of the lawsuit in this press release from NHeLP.
A hearing will be held on December 8th, 2020 to determine the next step in this lawsuit and to see what judgements will be made to either uphold or overturn The Alec Smith Insulin Affordability Act. We are pained to again face obstacles in simply finding a way for insulin to be accessible and affordable for our community. We know that this lawsuit is just another attempt by insulin manufacturers to retain their profits and overlook patients who are suffering greatly at their hands. Regardless of the judgement made in this case, we will not stop advocating for you all!
Wishing you warmest regards,

I really don’t have a whole lot of free time and with the long discussion about the differences between humalog and novolog I thought it would be interesting to post something. Hopefully I didn’t make any errors and it came out interesting.
There is a controversy right now among individuals about the differences between the two types of rapid acting insulin Humalog (Insulin Lispro) and Novolog (Insulin Apart). People claim they are the same, they are different and one works better than the other. This post will focus on the structure of the human insulin compared to each analog, and molecular mechanisms of each type, how they are formulated and how each should work. I’m not saying one is better than the other. The actions of each are specific to each person and the choice of insulin should always be a discussion between you and your physician. I have my personal preference and that’s exactly it, my personal preference for how I control my disease.
The first thing is to distinguish between the different types of insulin. This post will focus specifically on 2 of the rapid acting insulins, Humalog and Novolog. I am working on another blog post about how long acting insulins work. While they are different, they can be used interchangably. Pharmacies will readily substitute one for the other if they are out and the patient does not have a strong preference. This has been my experience, yours may/will differ.
So how are Novolog and Humalog different from regular human insulin?

2308,Mail order pharmacy is booming – here’s what to look out for,Treatment,Treatment,MilaStaff,,"WRITTEN BY: JULIA FLAHERTY
Editor’s Note: People who take insulin require consistently affordable and predictable sources of insulin at all times. If you or a loved one are struggling to afford or access insulin, click here.
COVID-19 has prompted many people with chronic illness to consider getting prescription drugs delivered through mail order pharmacies so they don’t have to deal with the risk of in-pharmacy visits. While a variety of options had already been available, the addition of Amazon’s mail order pharmacy in November broadened the options for people looking at mail order as a possibility.
Particularly for anyone reliant on insulin, receiving medication through the mail can come with risks, and the cost-savings often touted by mail order pharmacies may not always apply. Below, we explore how Amazon’s launch may impact the industry, as well as the overall impacts on cost, access, affordability, and convenience that mail order pharmacies can offer.
AMAZON’S DIGITAL PHARMACY
This November, Amazon made a big move into healthcare by launching an online pharmacy. Prime members are eligible to cover their prescription medications with their health insurance, paying a typical copay. If Prime members don’t have health insurance or don’t want to pay for their prescription medication using health insurance, they have access to generic and brand-name medications, some of which are discounted from typical list price.
This Amazon launch comes two years after it acquired PillPack, an online pharmacy known for putting the customer’s prescriptions into one complete packet and delivering it on a monthly basis. By launching its own digital pharmacy in 2020, Amazon has sent shockwaves through the healthcare sector, taking direct aim at its largest competitors, CVS Health and Walgreens, according to Bloomberg. Amazon also aims to compete with Walmart’s pharmacy.
While this launch has undoubtedly caused a stir in the mail order pharmacy market, it begs a bigger question for consumers: “What will the future of mail order pharmacies be?” And, for the diabetes community, “Will mail order pharmacy services offer better savings and convenience for managing my type 1 diabetes?”
IMPACTS ON COST
Depending on the consumer’s health insurance plan, a mail order pharmacy may save time and money. But without insurance, the consumer is unlikely to benefit. Often, through insurance, consumers are given discounts by ordering a 90-day supply (versus 30-day supply) through their health insurance’s own or contracted mail order pharmacy. Whereas, at a local in-person pharmacy, it may cost the consumer more to get the same refill for this select number of days.
The best way to determine if it will save you money by ordering from your local pharmacy versus ordering through your insurance’s mail order pharmacy is by calling both pharmacies to run a cost estimate before you fulfill your prescriptions. Or, if you have the option, you are often able to run a cost-savings analysis through your insurance website, usually found under “Pharmacy Benefits.”
Mail order pharmacies may make it more difficult to submit coupons through manufacturer programs or from GoodRX discounts, among others. Whereas, speaking to a local pharmacy rep may make the process easier and ensure you get the best prices on your medications. Combining coupon programs with insurance can be tricky, often leaving the consumer to weigh which option may provide a larger discount or benefit.
IMPACTS ON AFFORDABILITY
While mail order pharmacies do offer discounts to consumers through various coupon or 90-day ordering programs, many of these discounts still do not bring the price of insulin down to an accessible and affordable place for the general population. While advocates across the United States have petitioned to have insulin prices capped at $100 or less for a month’s supply, many discount programs offered through mail order pharmacies still cost the consumer hundreds, and sometimes even thousands of dollars, for 30, 60, or 90-day supplies.
The cost of insulin depends on the consumer’s access to robust health insurance coverage or eligibility for patient assistance programs or manufacturer coupons. Unfortunately, despite marketing claims from companies like Amazon, there is no clear sign that mail order pharmacies have or will help progress the access to affordable care. Pricing on the medication still comes down to who the product is made by, not who the product is sold directly to the consumer by, particularly as insulin remains one of the most expensive liquids in the world.
For blood glucose monitors and test strips, cost-savings often lie in ordering generic or subscription versus name-brand. Some generic or subscription test strip services offer a blood glucose meter for just $10-50, then a monthly supply of test strips for $8-$50 without insurance. Whereas, with insurance at their local pharmacy, consumers may actually pay more for the name-brand meter and strips because insurance dictates which meter and strips are preferred under their formulary.
IMPACTS ON CONVENIENCE
Mail order pharmacies have been shown to save consumers time. Digital prescription management and automatic refill opt-ins make the reorder process much more efficient and accurate. Consumers are able to easily manage their prescriptions on desktop and mobile devices for many mail order pharmacies today. However, if your prescriptions are set to run at a certain time, it may be difficult to disrupt the cycle if you won’t be home, whether because of work, vacation, visiting friends & family, etc. There is also the risk of medications being left outside your door for too long or even being taken if you live in a place that is generally unsafe for receiving high-cost packages.
For people with type 1 diabetes, you may also be concerned over insulin being kept cool until you’re able to get home and move your supplies to the fridge until you’re ready to use them. Mail order pharmacies generally include cooling packs when sending insulin. Additionally, if you need to start a prescription medication ASAP that’s new, a mail order pharmacy won’t be the best option. You may opt to enroll repeat medications with your mail order pharmacy but enroll new medications with a local pharmacy in the interim.
As mentioned above, mail order pharmacies are also limited in terms of face-to-face interactions, but you are often able to call your mail order pharmacy to ask questions or address concerns. If talking to a person face-to-face is a dealbreaker for you, mail order won’t be the most valuable option. You may also run the risk of medications arriving late or damaged through mail order pharmacies.
Overall, while mail order pharmacy makes sense for a lot of Americans, especially in today’s pandemic world, it may not be the safest, most cost effective, or most valuable option for people with type 1 diabetes. In order to find out if it’s the best method for you, talk to your healthcare team and do your research. Especially when it comes to insulin, getting your medications on time and intact is something you can’t gamble on.",Dec '20

2318,The impact of insulin rationing on mental health,Treatment,Treatment,MilaStaff,,"WRITTEN BY: T’ara Smith, MS, Nutrition Education
“Will I be able to pay all of my bills this month?”
It’s a question people with diabetes who ration insulin have to ask themselves when it’s time to choose between refilling a prescription and paying bills.
Insulin rationing is, unfortunately, a reality for people living with diabetes — both Type 1 and Type 2. A 2017 study showed 1 in 4 people with diabetes has rationed their insulin due to financial hardship. Rationing insulin includes underusing the prescribed amount of insulin needed to maintain glucose control, not filling a prescription, limiting carbohydrate intake, or stopping it altogether. Unsurprisingly, it is likely to lead to poorer glycemic management and can lead to death from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) 1, particularly in people with Type 1 diabetes. Not only does insulin rationing have a major impact on physical health, but it also takes a toll on one’s mental and emotional health.
It certainly makes sense, right? The costs of insulin have skyrocketed over the years, tripling over the past decade. In general, financial distress is strongly associated with depressive symptoms. 
People living with diabetes are already reminded of their disease every day. The stress of worrying whether or not you can literally afford to live is just one more addition to the already enormous mental health burden of living with a chronic disease.
“People with diabetes most often ration insulin because of cost, which is influenced by having no insurance, being underinsured, and family priorities,” said clinical psychologist Alicia McAuliffe-Fogarty, Ph.D., who also lives with Type 1 diabetes. “Nowadays, we have increased costs of medications, co-pays, and insurance, as well as the cost of living. So often people have to make these hard decisions: do I feed my kids? Can we survive without water and electricity this month so I can get insulin? These are decisions no one should have to make as insulin is a life-sustaining medication and without it, people will die.”
People with Diabetes Have Increased Risks for Anxiety and Depression
People with diabetes are two to three times more likely to suffer from depression and have elevated rates of anxiety, as I know all too well. For me, insulin rationing exacerbated my anxiety surrounding my diabetes.
The year I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, I was set to age out of my mother’s insurance several months later.  One of my major concerns was being able to afford my Lantus prescription. It had only been $25 under my mom’s insurance plan, but the list price without insurance was $400-$500. I knew I had to find a way to get covered, so I took out a loan to get insurance through my school. Unfortunately, insulin was still hundreds of dollars with my new coverage, so there were weeks I went without taking my insulin consistently until I was able to get Basaglar. The thought of suffering from complications, specifically a stroke or a heart attack, weighed heavily on my mind for months. It made living with diabetes more difficult, even scary.
Unhealthy and Healthy Coping Mechanisms to Insulin Rationing
There are healthy ways to cope with diabetes distress, such as getting support from professionals and loved ones and prioritizing self-care. But not all coping mechanisms are healthy. McAuliffe-Fogarty has seen patients resort to substance abuse, suffer from eating disorders such as anorexia, using expired insulin, dropping out of school, and forgoing opportunities to afford insulin.
“No one wants diabetes. It interferes with your life in every way,” said McAuliffe-Fogarty. “People with diabetes experience more mental health issues than people without diabetes, especially depression, which makes it more difficult for them to manage their disease. Often people try to escape or self-treat how they are feeling (e.g., sad, anxious, etc), and develop unhealthy coping methods. People with diabetes need to be treated as a whole person, both their physical and mental/emotional well-being. This includes their diabetes management, how they are feeling and functioning in other aspects of their life – their family life, ability to access basic necessities of food, clothing, shelter, medication, etc. to prevent and/or treat these issues.”
She also notes how people who struggle to obtain insulin won’t waste it even if it’s expired because it’s such a valued commodity. Any individual would take expired insulin to stay alive, especially if they’re already making other sacrifices in other parts of their lives and those of their families.
“These sacrifices include parents not taking the jobs they want, not being able to send their kids to dance lessons, not being able to take vacations, and making career decisions to get health insurance — all because they need to pay for diabetes supplies including insulin,” said McAuliffe-Fogarty, who will soon publish a study on this subject.
And for people who are hesitant to ask for help? Some may be too proud to do it, according to McAuliffe-Fogarty, and forgo basic necessities such as insulin. She’s also seen patients ration insulin, eat fewer carbs, and exercise more to avoid asking for help.
“The stress of the cost of insulin stresses people out and to add insult to injury, further increases their blood sugar,” said McAuliffe-Fogarty. “Also, in many cultures, it is embarrassing and taboo to ask for financial help, so people don’t. They often feel guilty of being a burden on their family and try to make do with what they have. Accessing life-sustaining drugs is a huge issue in this country and should not be this difficult for people to stay alive.”
How Health Providers Can Help Relieve Distress from Insulin Rationing
At the end of the day, insulin should be easily accessible, period. Being able to take insulin as prescribed,  is self-care, and reduces the stress of having to make life-or-death decisions. McAuliffe-Fogarty gives some practical tips she offers her patients to deal with diabetes distress from insulin rationing, tips from which other healthcare professionals, including primary care physicians, could use.
“If patients cannot afford insulin or access it, we make that a priority, whether it’s problem-solving on how to pay, calling the patient assistance programs right there or calling to ask for help from some non-profit organizations,” said McAuliffe-Fogarty. “The process that pharmaceutical companies have to provide financial assistance is getting a little easier but it still requires some work and documentation proof on the part of the patient. Often people don’t know what they are asking for or fill out the forms wrong, so making this a priority and doing it correctly with the patient so they get their insulin is important. Also discussing options such as the lower cost Walmart-brand insulins to tie them over is of discussion. We, including myself in the 1980s, used these types of insulin for years, and are still healthy. Although not ideal to use them with the newer insulin on the market, according to the data our A1cs weren’t much different sadly. So using these insulins is a very viable option for people.”
She also suggested doctors need to do more than simply asking patients if they need more refills for medications and getting frustrated with patients who don’t follow their recommendations. Doctors should also be inquiring if a patient is experiencing issues paying for those medications. For example, McAuliffe-Fogarty recalls seeing Type 2 patients who need insulin but remain on metformin because that’s all they can afford.
A Mental Burden People with Diabetes Shouldn’t Have to Bear
There’s no need to lecture or shame a person with diabetes on how insulin rationing is “wrong,” either. People with diabetes would always rather have an abundance of insulin than worry about where, when, and how the next batch of insulin vials or pens are coming. Those with diabetes don’t underutilize our prescribed insulin because we like seeing high blood glucose numbers and the other physical effects of hyperglycemia. There is no joy in making the tough decision to forgo insulin until the next pay cycle in order to pay rent or buy groceries (that some don’t even have enough insulin to bolus for!)
These decisions can have deadly consequences. Notable stories include Alec Smith, who died in 2017 at the age of 26, after he was no longer covered by his mother’s insurance; Jada Louis, who had to choose between paying her rent or $300 for insulin 1 and passed at the age of 24 after being hospitalized for DKA; and Meaghan Carter, a 47-year-old nurse with no health insurance, who died alone on her sofa on Christmas Day in 2018 3.
We live in the age of “self-care,” where we’re inundated with memes and colorful Instagram graphics on how to manage stress and protect our mental health. For people with diabetes, included in that self-care routine is knowing we have enough insulin to live to see and  enjoy  another day without undue financial burden. It also means reaching out for help and seeking help from a mental health professional and having access to resources to help us get insulin when we need it. It also means  not  falling into the traps of unhealthy coping mechanisms such: as starvation, substance abuse, and forgoing other positive quality of life goals.
Rationing insulin because there’s no other option is a life-or-death issue. Life with diabetes, in general, already has its ups and downs. But, shouldering those ups and downs with the uncertainty of being able to consistently get vital medication to survive is a mental and emotional burden no person with diabetes should have to bear.",May '20

2327,More than a little suprised,Treatment,Treatment,Rphil2Type 1 or LADA,,"This practice is called non medical switching.  It is like, but not really like, using a generic for a name brand pill.
In this case it is the exact same insulin.  Your insurance company has made an economic decision to use the lesser cost.
Here is where it breaks down.  Suppose there were two products  functionally the same.  But not identical in make up.  This would be called a biosimilar.  Humalog and Novolog are bio similar, functionally the same but different.
Now recall that most people in our community get very upset if the insurance company changes formulary and the company is changed.  Well in the bio medication community A change might be truly devastating.  in today’s world Bio-Similar companies are now making a large swath of of very expensive medications.
For instance, my RA medication has a list price of 25K per administration with 6 doses per yea.r  $125K.  when  bio similar comes on the market it will likely cost about 80K per year.  A large incentive to switch.
But since i never see the vial i might never know what i got, if I am not informed before hand.  In fact i might not know what it I received ever.
For that reason those us who use these medications we are demanding that non medical forced switching not be allowed.    It goes like this if a docotr prescribes differently then fine, that is a medical reason.  If not then switching cannot be be done unless our doctor and we agree.
We ask for general support for our position.  We know that someday Humalog and Novolog may be biosimilar insulin, but eventual insulin will be more broadly produced.  After all if the biosimilar manufacturers have set up to make RA medications. they can certianily produce bio similar insulin.  Please help us stop non medical switching)

It’s a flat $35 copay for a one-month supply as written on your script regardless of the quantity.
Unfortunately, ExpressScripts won’t honor the card so you’ll need to use someone else. I’ve used it for Humalog at Walgreens.  I’m on a high-deductible PPO so even though ExpessScripts covers Humalog, until I meet my deductible it’s still less expensive to use the card.

Most important to me, there was no loss of effectiveness when my insulin reservoir dropped below 50u (Tandem X2 pump). That was my biggest gripe with  Fiasp. Only one reservoir so far so I’m not ready to declare victory just yet.


Starts acting as fast as Fiasp. Should theoretically start a bit faster, but it isn’t noticeable to me.


Ramps up to full activity faster than Fiasp and is out of my body sooner.

I also use a reservoir 5-6 days. It seems to only happen at the bottom of the reservoir no matter what I tried. I tried filling the reservoir with less insulin, changing the type of infusion set, using extended boluses near the bottom of the reservoir, and a few others I don’t recall. If finally threw in the towel and diluted Fiasp 80/20 with Humalog and things were fine. But what a pain in the rear that is!
My theory, completely speculative, is that Fiasp is more viscous than Humalog or Novolog (due to additives) and that presents problems with Tandem’s unique pumping mechanism.
On the other hand, many (most?) people have no problem with Fiasp in the X2, so who knows.

@Paytone I don’t think your Tandem pump and its unique internal configuration has anything to do with Fiasp gumming up the works (occluding the plumbing) that some of us have experienced.
I’m currently using a MM Paradigm 522 pump (18 years old? … thanks Ruth  ) and I found that towards the end of day 3 the line to the infusion set occludes when pumping Fiasp insulin.

I found taking cinnamon supplements help with lowering blood sugar levels so I take it usually in addition with insulin so I do not have to take too much insulin to bring the numbers down.

I take a super complex vitamin B which helps with metabolism and energy. Vitamin D supplements because I have a deficiency and it gives me so much energy when I do.

Garlic supplements, which does at times seep through your pours even though it says odorless, which helps with my heart and blood pressure. When my sugar levels are high usually I have rapid heartbeats. Garlic is also good for ( men look away) yeast infections which happens often when levels are high.

Aloe-vera , Green, Chamomile teas which helps lower blood sugar, get rid of antioxidants, and calm my tension. I keep tension like it will be worth more than gold one day. Dandelion tea because I also retain water which causes me to swell up and it helps releases it.

Sweet potatoes with butter and cinnamon is not only delicious but it helps lower my sugar levels. Eat a small banana or one low carb yogurt a day for potassium, which helps with muscle cramps my potassium is always low.

I do not drink cow milk, only almond or soy, because it produces mucus and with my horrible sinus/allergies it is a guarantee result of high sugar levels. Water I have to drink a lot of water to avoid dehydration, it will increase my levels also.

Medicine is wonderful however I do not think it is needed for everything, there are more natural ways to help your body.

I’m not sure about that but It was originally thought I might have to change my pod every 2 days because of my usage so they prescribed the 200. It turns out my usage went down so much it wasn’t necessary.
But I liked it so I stayed with it and only use about 25 measured units of it or really 50 units of insulin a day. Which brings me to the point it can be confusing for people at times who aren’t used to it. Please be aware of that if you switch from using the pen and pump at all.
My endo that put me on the pump is the one that originally prescribed it. When I moved the endo here originally wrote the prescription for 25 units a day of U-200, but it can’t be written like that, it still has to be written as 50 units of insulin. When I have talked to the mail order pharmacy staff before, they completely understood, but this last time the lady I talked to didn’t have a clue and then wanted to half the prescription when I tried to explain it to her. Because you fill up a pod or reservoir by volume. So as soon as I mentioned I put 80 units volume into my pod for 3 days her understanding went out the window.
And Humalog does not want to hear it’s for a pump, I guess it’s not “approved” for it. So if you talk to them for any reason just don’t mention that. My endo that prescribed it said she did so all the time and she was a type 1 herself. It only comes in a pen.
The other thing is it’s helpful to have someone familiar with programming helping you with programming the initial pump numbers, you don’t have to, but at first it’s a little confusing. Everything is virtually doubled. So on the I/C programming if I take 1 unit for 7 carbs, I have to put 1 unit for 14 carbs etc. 1 unit for 25 correction is 1 unit for 50.

@Marie20, does Omnipod formally approve of U200 use in its pumps?
I’ve never used concentrated insulin, beyond the U100 kind. I know from a few threads here that people are often confused about the concept.
Ten units of U100 or U200 or U500 are all equivalent insulin doses. The liquid volume of each of those 10-unit doses is different. U200 is one half the volume of U100 and U500 is one fifth the U100 volume.
Where important safety mistakes are made is when someone uses, for example, a U100 syringe to draw up insulin from a higher concentration insulin vial. This can and has led to insulin overdoses.
Sorry to veer somewhat off-topic here, @Yifat. I just wanted readers to think about the safety aspects of using insulin of a different concentration than what the equipment was designed for.
Larger volume insulin doses are slower to perform. Halving the volume of insulin your son uses for the same meal dose will likely give him better performance.  I would try it if I were faced with that situation.",Dec '19

2383,White House issues executive orders taking aim at drug prices,Treatment,Treatment,MilaStaff,5,"WRITTEN BY: Todd Boudreaux
In a press conference held on Friday, July 24 President Trump announced and signed four Executive Orders aimed at lowering prescription drug prices in the United States.
An Executive Order is an operational directive signed by the President to guide the Executive branch of the federal government. It does not need to be voted upon by Congress, but Congress may create a law that nullifies an Executive Order.
Notably, Executive Orders involving regulatory change do not go into effect immediately. The signing of these bills means that his administration now needs to go through the regulatory process of reforming the current system to implement these orders. That is unlikely to happen before November’s election, and if any of the policies are enacted during this term, they would likely face court challenges as well.
What are the new orders that were signed and what do they do for drug pricing?
Executive Order #1 1 – “Allow Importation”  – State, wholesalers and pharmacies will be permitted to safely and legally import prescription drugs from Canada and other countries where the price is lower.
Americans pay among the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world. People with diabetes in the United States sometimes resort to crossing the border into Canada (or elsewhere) to obtain insulin, something the president made specific reference to in his reasoning for this order. If it were possible to import insulin and pay foreign prices, this could be a significant cost-saving measure for many.
Of special note, this Executive Order requires, under Section 2(b), the Secretary of Health and Human Services to deem that the re-importation of insulin is required for “emergency medical care” and does not pose a public safety risk.
Executive Order #2 1 – “More Affordable Insulin/ Epipens”  – This order will require Federal Community Health Centers to pass discounts they receive on insulin and epipens to their patients.
Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) currently receive heavily discounted prices on certain drugs from manufacturers under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which provides primary care health services in underserved areas as defined in Section 1905(l)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act. Were this Executive Order to become finalized and go into effect, people who receive care through these centers could see significant reductions in the cost of their insulin, though still likely more than Trump’s claim of “pennies a day.”
Executive Order #3 1 – “Rebate Rule” – This order takes aim at what Trump referred to as the “middlemen and middlewomen” of drug pricing in the United States – the Pharmacy Benefit Managers. This Order states that rebates previously received by the PBMs will be passed on to the patient.
The complex system of insulin pricing in the U.S. has many players, including PBMs who are often referred to as middlemen, negotiating drug prices between payers and manufacturers. Targeting the system of rebates paid to PBMs has long been at the center of Trump’s drug-pricing reform policy, formally announcing plans in early 2019 to take on the issue. In July of that same year however, the administration dropped those plans due to the potential of increases in Medicare Part D premiums, as rebates offer heavy subsidies to the plans. Many thought that would be the end of it, making today’s third executive order surprising. While the EO states that discounts should be passed to the patients, it will require significant restructuring of the Medicare Part D system.
Executive Order #4 – “Most Favored Nation (MFN)”  – This order would require Medicare to purchase drugs from manufacturers at the same price that other countries pay, using the International Price Index (IPI) Model. This would only affect those under federal insurance plans, not the majority of Americans living with diabetes on commercial insurance plans.
The announcement of this order also came with a one-month ultimatum of sorts for drug manufacturers. Trump said that implementation will be held until August 24th at 12:00pm EDT to give manufacturers time to offer alternative solutions. The president also announced that drug manufacturers will be in the White House on Tuesday July 28 to further discuss the issue. This ticking clock is likely the reason that the 4th EO has not been posted to whitehouse.gov.
What does this mean for people with diabetes?
If any of these executive orders are enacted, each would have a specific impact on the cost of insulin for a segment of people in the United States.
Unfortunately, each executive order also comes with it’s own unique set of hurdles. Importing drugs from foreign countries requires FDA approval, and cooperation from the countries of export as well. A statement from the Canadian Government on Trump’s announcement is expected soon, however in December of 2019, Health Canada spokesperson Alexander Cohen said: “Our government will protect our supply of and access to medication that Canadians rely on.” Last summer the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis signed a bill into law that sought to allow the state to import drugs at lower costs from Canada. One year later, and the law has yet to be approved by the FDA. DeSantis spoke at the press conference today, praising the president’s Executive Orders.
Indeed, many of the proposals signed into Executive Orders have existed in some form prior, and have been held up for various reasons for years. According to STAT news, “The Trump administration’s importation plan was originally released in July 2019, while the international pricing plan was initially proposed in October 2018. The administration originally promised the program would be up and running by the spring of 2020.”
The pressure to reform drug pricing in the United States, including insulin, remains high. Campaign promises of the 2016 election to control healthcare costs including drug pricing are far from fulfilled. Whether these Executive Orders will be followed up with changes necessary to bring down drug costs remains to be seen.",Jul '20

Just opening the fact that it’s okay to buy from other countries hopefully opens the door for various companies or groups to purchase from other countries which pay much cheaper prices. Once you have the competition of a cheaper price hopefully it will bring down the prices here and start to change some of our very messed up system of prescription drugs, rebates, kick backs while the consumer is the only one that gets nailed with full retail prices.
Hopefully a start.",Jul '20

This is stuff he would have to work on in 2nd term. There’s not enough time left. But, a lot of this stuff are issues that we have been raising and working on for years, so it is kinda exciting to see it leap up to the top of the totem pole (I don’t have a good metaphor this morning). Some (not all) of this stuff is in play already, here. ADA and Mayo and MN are working on it. Its just getting national attention.
I never actually believe any of this stuff is gonna ‘fix’ healthcare. Its become a sport to swing  bat at the system - an exciting sport. Its fun! Its extra special fun when they make pharma show up to the game. You should have been there when they made the PBMs come into committee in MN. It was a witch burning. If people had garbage, the audience would have thrown it at her. I might have booo-ed when she said something. It was like a freaky-deaky, old fashioned carnival. It was the best ticket in town.
I like how Marie frames the issue. I wish the prez didn’t go after the allies so rudely, like its their fault that they have functioning healthcare. This mess is all our own creation and no one else’s. It’s our lobbyist’s, corporate culture, and lack of medical ethics that broke our medical system. Can’t pin this on France. You can pin it on China, though, to a large degree, but not entirely. We played a role in our own undoing. Prez might be helping pharma save face by blaming the allies.

2388,White House issues executive orders taking aim at drug prices,Treatment,Treatment,JamesIgoe,1,"As you mention, about not seeing how we can fix health care, any attempt to fix the system creates pushback from other parts of the same system.
An economics text I read 20 years ago, when I read more in finance, economics, and business, described the cost problem as having three providers, insurers, pharma/device, and hospitals/doctors. Any attempt to control just one part of the system would be ineffective, as the other two raise prices, or make covert deals that nullify any attempts at control. It is like playing whack-a-mole with the medical system, and the only way to control prices would be to engage/legislate all three. Worse, all three are deeply entrenched, powerful blocs, with hospitals only becoming more so in the last few years. The latter are consolidating, buying up practices, cutting care, while simultaneously billing at higher rates since they are more effective at using the system.
In addition to legislating all three, they need to use the buying power of the federal government and Medicare to affect market prices. The providers, both powerful and entrenched will push back, leading to some compromises, a necessity, if there is going to be any change, similar to the ACA.",Jul '20

 JamesIgoe:

I think they would need to legislate all three, as well as use the largess of the federal government and Medicare to affect market prices.


They would also need to pass new laws as loopholes and problems are discovered. The intersection of the ACA’s Medical Loss Ratio with pharma created the pbm rebate issue which essentially results in an increase in cost of drugs to the consumer (only those that require drugs) while allowing the insurer a rebate that keeps the premium low and MLR on target. This results in overall unnecessary increases in administration costs (wrapped into the cost of drugs passed along to consumers in plans with coinsurance and deductibles) and further exacerbates the pharma monopolies.
Passing legislation and then leaving it as is for 10 years is never going to work.",Jul '20

So there are many entities that negotiate privately with manufacturers to obtain the best possible rate for the upcoming year - medicare, VA, various state entities (CA has like 8 separate entities) and the negotiations or each are bound by a NDA so the other entities have no idea if they got a great deal or not.  Assume that either the VA or Medicare got the best negotiated rate for the year (largest user population/most Rxs/ greatest volume = best rate).  Take that rate, make it public (no NDAs allowed), add 10% for all other groups, eliminate PBMs and rebates and your cost across the nation would be significantly less per person.   Alternatively, we could do as our Northern neighbor does and negotiate costs as a nation, thereby strong arming the mfrs to sell at a much more reasonable rate that is transparent.",Sep '20

In mid August, there was a recall on a particular brand of Metformin due to trace amounts of MDMA. I must’ve been taking the brand because my next prescription said ‘new brand.’ Didn’t think anything of it until the last couple weeks where my insulin sensitivity has been plummeting.

I can report that a close friend of mine had a bleed into his vitreous caused by a partial retinal detachment. He sought a second opinion at Stanford and doctors used a vitrectomy to effect a reattachment of the retina. In his case, all the blood and debris did reabsorb and he has normal vision in that eye.

In my experience, it gets a lot better within 3 weeks since even though I will still see plenty of blood, my vision is usually fairly functional by then.
Also, if you vomit or cough badly enough, even someone without retinopathy can get a hemorrhage, so it may or may not indicate a significant problem. But definitely get seen by retina specialist as soon as you can (may need to wait for the blood to clear a bit for them to really get a good idea of what is going on) so they can decide what treatment if any is warranted to prevent further bleeds. Also key, as Terry points out, to rule out detachments, and to check for edema (swelling) of the retina.
It is SUPER scary to have this kind of thing happen, but as someone who did and now has retinopathy as a chronic but largely managed condition (I got laser and more aggressive treatment at the beginning, but now get injections every 3-9 months and only occasionally have small bleeds that prompt sooner injections and clear up fast, but no vitrectomies), it actually isn’t that bad.

He is taking complete rest. Even though he is recovering slowly, he often complains about pain in his legs. His doctor provided the usual treatment, and nothing new was suggested for reducing pain after the amputation surgery. So I did online research for post-surgery pain rehabilitation solutions and came to know about in-home physiotherapy 1. When asked to a friend who is a final year medical student, he told physiotherapy is good for healing injuries and pain after surgery and suitable for people facing mobility issues after that. But he is not sure about it in the case of doing physiotherapy after amputation surgery. Has anyone of you or your relatives has done physiotherapy after diabetic amputation surgery? Is it safe? Was it beneficial? If not, what are the alternatives? From some online articles which I have read, I think it is better to heal pain before heading for prosthetic training. Can somebody help me clarify my doubts? Kindly share your thoughts and advice as it would help us to make a decision.
Thanks",Sep '20

2429,Alternative supplements used in Type 1 Diabetes,Treatment,Treatment,Seydlitz,1,"The supplements you list are the sort which improve insulin action, such as chromium, but the real problem n diabetes is the disconnect between blood sugar control and the development of complications.  Many patients, for example, have excellent blood sugar control but develop severe complications quickly, while others with poor control never develop complications.  Only a third of type 1 diabetics develop kidney failure, for example, but the blood sugar control in this group is no worse on average than in other groups, yet this is the most devastating complication.  The latest evidence indicates that renal failure in diabetics may well be caused by genetic factors inherited along with the factors which dispose patients to develop diabetes in the first place.  So the question is, what can you do to keep the complications at bay in addition to blood sugar control?
For this there are many supplements with promise, and if you check ‘Pubmed’ for various supplements and their associated complications plus the search term ‘diabetic’ or ‘diabetes,’ you will find a lot of peer-reviewed scientific studies examining their effectiveness.  Since the damage done by hyperglycemia operates through the mechanism of inflammation, and many supplements help reduce inflammation (e. g., such as vitamin E, krill oil, omega-3), they are certainly worth a try.  There are also now some drug interaction checkers on the internet which list drug-supplement interactions, have a look at this as well.",Sep '17

I know how you feel. I also wish that some had shown actual scientific value.
Unfortunately, there is no supplement so far that has been proven and recognized effective for diabetes purposes (although lack of many elements can worsen our conditions). There are doubtful studies for many.

2434,Alternative supplements used in Type 1 Diabetes,Treatment,Treatment,Seydlitz,,"Everyone seems to be focusing on improving blood sugar control as the sole way to avoid complications, and perhaps using supplements to enhance control, but the essential point to keep in mind is that there is a mismatch between blood sugar control and complications.  Many people with excellent control die young from kidney failure, while many people with extremely poor control prove resistant to complications, so we need to consider other methods as well for protection.
It is simply not true that supplements have been proven useless to prevent diabetic complications.  The problem is that there is a power issue here, and the medical establishment does not want patients circumventing the power of doctors and the power of Big Pharma to buy relatively inexpensive supplements and avoid paying money to physicians for appointments or to Big Pharma for absurdly expensive prescription drugs.  Often this power prejudice manifests itself in clinical studies which examine the effects of absurdly small amounts of vitamins, find no effect, and then scream to the rooftops that vitamins are useless.
There are in fact so many honest studies proving the value of vitamins in addressing diabetic complications that listing them all would be impossible. But the way many of them work is this:  Hyperglycemia causes damage by generating inflammation, and inflammation produces reactive oxygen species, or ROS, which are harmful.  But many vitamins oppose inflammation and reduce ROS, and so by this mechanism they block complications by an alternative route to difficult and potentially lethal strict blood sugar control.

Like most articles on the value of supplements, this one is not on humans (but rats), comes from a very weak research hospital (all authors but one come from Cairo University, Egypt), and has not been followed up by any further development (published 2009):
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1056872708000342 4
There is limited value to some supplements for some people. Like many, I used to have a cabinet full of them. As more scientific information has come out infirming their value, I have progressively pared them down to almost nothing.
The sad fact is that, as much as we would like to find natural solutions to the major problems created by diabetes, there aren’t any that have been found so far.

F. Chiarelli, et al., “Circulating Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 and Early Development of Nephropathy in Type 1 Diabetes,” Diabetes Care, 25 (10) 1829-1834 (2002)
“Long-term treatment with high-dose vitamin E significantly decreased MCP [harmful] [in patients with type 1 diabetes] thus providing a rational basis for evaluating vitamin E supplementation as therapy … .”
W. Engelein, et al., “Effects of Long-Term Supplementation with Moderate Pharmacologic Doses of Vitamin E … in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes,” American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 72 (5) 1142-1149 (2000)
Vitamin E counteracts increased LDL (low density lipoprotein) oxidation in diabetes and so “life-long supplementation with vitamin E should be considered in patients with type 1 diabetes.”
T. Costacou, et al., “Oxidative Stress and Response Relation to Coronary Heart Disease in Type 1 Diabetes,” Diabetes Care, 36 (1) 3503-3509 (2003)
Alpha-tocopherol (a form of vitamin E) levels are associated with lower incidence of cardio-vascular disease in type 1 diabetics.
T. Costacou, et al., “Antioxidants and Cardio-Vascular Disease Among Individuals with Type 1 Diabetes: Findings from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study,” Journal of Diabetes Complications, 20 (6) 387-394 (2006)
“… a protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against cardio-vascular disease was observed among anti-oxidant supplement users … and in renal disease.”
A. Ceriello, et al., “Vitamin E Reduction of Protein Glycosylation in Diabetes.  A New Prospect for Prevention of Complications?” Diabetic Complications, 14 (1) 68-72 (1991)
“These results demonstrate that vitamin E administration may reduce glycosylation in diabetic subjects independently of changes in plasma glucose … .  Long-term studies may establish the usefulness of vitamin E administration for prevention of diabetic complications.”
So these are just a very, very few of the studies which could be cited.  Although many are tentative in conclusions, this is in part the reticence typical of all medical journal article claims, but even if the results are not thoroughly confirmed yet, since most supplements are harmless, and the complications are developing right now, I don’t feel I can afford to wait for full effectiveness to be established twenty or thirty years from now, when I would be dead even if I were healthy.",Sep '17

 Seydlitz:

There are so many scientific, peer-reviewed studies showing the benefits of supplements to combat the complications of type 1 diabetes in humans


“There are so many unconfirmed scientific, peer-reviewed studies showing tentative benefits of supplements that have never been confirmed and followed by any satisfactory proof of worthwhile benefits to PWDs” would be more correct to me. I would challenge anyone to show just one such study (that has been confirmed and followed by a satisfactory proof of worthwhile benefits) 
And, as assumed by the statement above, none of the studies linked above show confirmed and satisfactory proof of worthwhile benefits to diabetics. Let’s look at each of them.



 Seydlitz:

F. Chiarelli, et al., “Circulating Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 and Early Development of Nephropathy in Type 1 Diabetes,” Diabetes Care, 25 (10) 1829-1834 (2002)
“Long-term treatment with high-dose vitamin E significantly decreased MCP [harmful] [in patients with type 1 diabetes] thus providing a rational basis for evaluating vitamin E supplementation as therapy … .”


As shown by your own quote, this one was so inconclusive that it could only “give a rational basis for evaluating vitamin E supplementation”, in other words, no proof and no benefits 



 Seydlitz:

W. Engelein, et al., “Effects of Long-Term Supplementation with Moderate Pharmacologic Doses of Vitamin E … in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes,” American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 72 (5) 1142-1149 (2000)
Vitamin E counteracts increased LDL (low density lipoprotein) oxidation in diabetes and so “life-long supplementation with vitamin E should be considered in patients with type 1 diabetes.”


The study you cite shows zero improvement to diabetes outcomes. In fact, it does not even evaluate them.
Furthermore, since the understanding of the roles of LDL and HDL is now in the process of being drastically revised, and many questions are now raised as to what exactly they mean to patients, it is very unlikely that increasing LDL oxidation in diabetes would be seen today by anyone as having a causal relationship to actual health improvement to diabetics.



 Seydlitz:

T. Costacou, et al., “Oxidative Stress and Response Relation to Coronary Heart Disease in Type 1 Diabetes,” Diabetes Care, 36 (1) 3503-3509 (2003)
Alpha-tocopherol (a form of vitamin E) levels are associated with lower incidence of cardio-vascular disease in type 1 diabetics.

“… a protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against cardio-vascular disease was observed among anti-oxidant supplement users … and in renal disease.”


You forgot to include the key sentence there: “None of the antioxidant measures (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, retinol, TAR) showed protection against incident CAD overall.” This means there was no effect correlated to the amount taken.
How do the authors of the studies feel about their own findings? Do they feel this it warrants using these supplements? No. Their conclusion: “The specificity of these effects merits further investigation.” I don’t see that a very strong endorsement of your own study!



 Seydlitz:

A. Ceriello, et al., “Vitamin E Reduction of Protein Glycosylation in Diabetes.  A New Prospect for Prevention of Complications?” Diabetic Complications, 14 (1) 68-72 (1991)
“These results demonstrate that vitamin E administration may reduce glycosylation in diabetic subjects independently of changes in plasma glucose … . Long-term studies may establish the usefulness of vitamin E administration for prevention of diabetic complications.”


This 1991 publication has no follow-up studies or confirmation, nor consequences in terms of recommendations by any diabetes organizations. Ceriello himself never followed up: if you enter “Ceriello” and “Vitamin E” in Google Scholar you will find no followup to THIS study or further work on proof of efficacy with PWDs. I surmise that no long-term studies established the usefulness of vitamin E administration for prevention of diabetic complications after all 
So, as you can see, none of these studies held up under scrutiny.



 Seydlitz:

Although many are tentative in conclusions, this is in part the reticence typical of all medical journal article claims, but even if the results are not thoroughly confirmed yet since most supplements are harmless,


The reticence is due to the scientific process and the need for a standard of proof. They simply do not show the required proof of benefits to PWDs.



 Seydlitz:

I don’t feel I can afford to wait for full effectiveness to be established twenty or thirty years from now when I would be dead even if I were healthy.


Here we both agree. If you would want to do so, it is a reasonable choice to decide that, even though there is no proof of effectiveness but only tentative possibilities, it is worth taking some supplements because the alternative has no upside.
I do want, however, to tell you the story of a  very close friend who was diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer. After 6 months of standard medicine and no improvement, he decided to go to an “immunotherapy” clinic in Texas, well known for its very high claims, its lack of scientific proof, and its very high prices (125K per treatment). I spent a few days researching it. He got irritated with me, the poor guy, and told me: “I understand that it is likely balloney. But what is my alternative?” I could not fault him. He went to the clinic, spent $125K, and died 4 months later.
So you should feel free to spend your money on these supplements. And who knows? There is always a chance that one of them will work for you!

2455,Podiatrist recommend me Orthopedic Shoes,Treatment,Treatment,RichmatikType 1 or LADA,1,"There are at least a couple of approaches that you can take for this, but personally I’d probably do some combination of them depending on the type of footwear you’re purchasing.
If you go to any respectable running footwear store, locally we have places called The Running Room, they will be able to fit you to a shoe that would be most comfortable for the shape of your foot - both size-wise and arch. Don’t feel obligated to buy your shoes from them, but they should be able to point you to the style/type/make of shoe that will work for you best.
For example, Nike shoes are notoriously a bit wider, Reebok/Adidas/Under Armour shoes tend to be skinnier. Some brands will have a ‘wide’ option available, which you might need, and others might have half sizes that others don’t.
From there you could get custom inserts made by an orthopedic specialist that will contour to your actual needs and they’ll be sized to both your foot and the footwear you plan to use them in. Hopefully your insurance will be able to cover some or all of the cost as they can be pricey, especially if you’re getting them in more than one pair of shoes.
Something to keep in mind is that even proper fitting footwear takes time to wear in before it’ll feel right, so don’t be surprised if they don’t feel perfect the first few times you wear them.

I have high arches, but that is why I never use arch support. In fact, any arch support is irritating, and sometimes can be painful for me.
The time my podiatrist suggested and created orthotics I declined to use them. Why do I need orthotics? It just seemed like an unnecessary expense.
I always walk barefoot in the apartment, on hardwood floors. In the building basement, it becomes more important, as the porters leave some detritus around as part of their work.

As I age, padding matters for me. I have developed some neuropathy, i.e., occasional tingles, in my feet and I notice that it seems worse if I pound my feet on long hikes around Manhattan in low cushion sneakers. On those days I wear my cross country running shoes.
Moisturizing matters, something I tend not to attend to until it becomes an issue.

Are you satisfied that your insulin to carb ratio used to calculate your Humalog dose is correct? Do you pre-bolus your Humalog and allow it some time, say 30 minutes, to start working before eating?
If you’re satisfied that your insulin to carb ratio is good and you’re good with your pre-bolus time then it sounds like increasing your Tresiba dose would make sense.

2466,Half-price generics of Novolog and Novolog mix announced by Novo Nordisk,Treatment,Treatment,MilaStaff,,"WRITTEN BY: Todd Boudreaux
On Friday, September 6, Novo Nordisk announced in a press release that authorized generic versions of NovoLog and NovoLog Mix will be made available on January 2, 2020. The news was part of a broader announcement of more affordable options coming at the start of the year. In addition to the authorized generics, Novo Nordisk will be offering a $99.00 Cash Card program for analog insulin.
The list prices for Insulin Aspart and Insulin Aspart Mix (generics for NovoLog and NovoLog Mix) are set at 50% of the list prices of branded versions. Prices for new authorized generics in vials and pens are listed below:

Insulin Aspart 10mL vial/1000 Units: $144.68
Insulin Aspart 5x3mL Penfill (box of 5 pens)/1500 Units: $268.73
Insulin Aspart 5x3mL FlexPen (box of 5 pens)/1500 Units: $279.41
Insulin Aspart 70/30 FOB 10mL vial/1000 Units: $150.06
Insulin Aspart 70/30 FOB 5x3mL FlexPen (box of 5 pens)/1500 Units: $279.41

Novo Nordisk expects that Insulin Aspart will be available to patients who take NovoLog without an additional prescription from a doctor. Patients will be able to speak directly with a pharmacist to determine whether NovoLog or Insulin Aspart is a more cost effective option for them.The authorized generics will be made available from newly established Novo Nordisk US affiliate Novo Nordisk Pharma Inc. (NNPI).
The announcement mirrors that of Lilly Diabetes last March, when the company announced that an authorized generic version of Humalog — Insulin Lispro — was being made available for half the price of Humalog 2. The same question that Lilly Diabetes faced at the time is likely to be asked of Novo Nordisk: Why not just cut the price of NovoLog in half?
If Novo Nordisk were to cut the list prices of of its current insulins, it would jeopardize insurance coverage for them due to the complex system of insulin pricing in the United States. High (and rising) list prices for NovoLog and other insulins are partially due to rebates paid by the insulin manufacturer to insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers. Introducing a generic insulin at half the cost means that insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and other members of the supply chain will continue to receive large rebates through existing contracts on the brand name drugs, while Novo Nordisk can simultaneously offer a lower-cost generic option for those in need.
Novo Nordisk has indicated to Beyond Type 2 that they are in ongoing discussions with wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers to encourage formulary uptake of the authorized generics.
People without insurance who are paying 100% out of pocket for their supplies are likely to benefit the most from the half-price options. People with diabetes on high-deductible health insurance plans (HDHPs) will also have another option that reduces monthly out-of-pocket expenses before they’ve met their deductible. Those with comprehensive drug coverage as part of insurance may not find this option helpful.
“People with diabetes need more affordable options and we are going to continue doing what we can now while also working with other healthcare stakeholders on longer-term system reform. For instance, we support the recent IRS ruling that classifies diabetes medications as preventive care. We believe this has the potential to help a significant number of people with diabetes from an affordability perspective,” said Doug Langa, Executive Vice President, North America Operations and President of Novo Nordisk Inc.
The IRS designation of insulin as a preventative service 3 allows such medications to be exempt from the deductible phase of some health plans, preventing patients from ever paying full list price for their insulin. This guidance can be applied to health plans starting in 2020, and many are hopeful that insurance providers will opt in, as there is ample evidence to suggest that widening access for insulin will be cheaper for payers in the long term. Indeed, insurance providers as well as advocacy groups had been pushing for the change; managing chronic health conditions before they become exacerbated — and more costly — can be viewed as a win-win for both patient and insurer. For people with diabetes, uninterrupted access to insulin is both life-sustaining and cost saving.
The other new offer announced by Novo Nordisk launching on January 2, 2020 is a $99.00 Cash Card program for analog insulins which, according to the press release, “allows people with diabetes to purchase up to three vials or two packs of FlexPen/FlexTouch pens of any combination of Novo Nordisk analog insulins (3000 – 3600 Units total depending on brands) for a flat cost of $99.00.” The Cash Card program will be available to people with commercial insurance as well as the uninsured.
The press release also pointed to affordability programs currently offered by Novo Nordisk, as well human insulin from the manufacturer which is available for $25/vial at Walmart and other locations.",Sep '19

This is an important point. If insurance decides not to cover the generic, then those with high-deductible insurance will still foot the bill for the overpriced brand name.
I had that problem getting generic Humalog from Express Scripts. Humalog isn’t on their formulary so my doctor filed a PA requesting they supply the generic version. Guess what?

2473,Half-price generics of Novolog and Novolog mix announced by Novo Nordisk,Treatment,Treatment,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,2,"What also gets me is their now “half priced” is still more expensive than years ago. I’ve watched Lantus go from $79  (2009/2010?) a vial to about $300 now. So “half price” for Lantus might be better than the gouging they are doing now but will still net them a big profit.
I have not a clue how much Novolog was back then to know what it’s cheaper price it sold at.
I have to wonder if the price increase was in expectation of controls and a win win for them. Make lots of money while they can, plus when we bargain for a cheaper price we say, see how much lower we are willing to sell it?
Plus the kickback situation, like when generic Humalog wasn’t on the formulary because I’m sure they weren’t getting kickbacks is also ridiculous. The insurance companies in this case are just as guilty about people that don’t have coverage or have a high deductible having to pay exorbitant prices.
I think CJ114 is right, just get it from Canada and it’s not the “game” it is here.
Believe me when I say they are entitled to profit, but the problem is why is the US getting hit with the high prices for some people only? And Europe, Canada etc don’t pay it.

Monday this week (it’s now Friday), I tried to order my refill of Novolog. The Walgreens website said the refill wasn’t approved by my doctor. I called Walgreens and was told that when they faxed the doc for renewal of the Rx, they were told that they had never prescribed it for me, so the Rx was not approved.  That was ridiculous because I’ve used Novolog off and on for years (I tend to swap between Novolog, Humalog, and FIASP) in my pump. But they said a few minutes later, they got an Rx for it, so I could pick it up later that day. Checked in with them later before firing up the jalopy and was told again - no approval.  This has gone on now for five days. Finally got a real pharmacist on the line who told me that there is a new generic for Novolog out. That was what they asked the doc to prescribe. My doc said no on that one so the Walgreen system listed it as “not approved by prescriber”. And, the Walgreens pharmacist told me that Walgreens corporate has directed them not to use the new generic because most insurances won’t pay for it yet. So their computer system currently has conflicting instructions that wouldn’t let me get my Novolog.
The last convo I had with Walgreens is that the Rx has been straightened out, but they have to go through the pre-approval process with Medicare Part B like they do every month, so there was further delay. Just now, they told me it would be ready this afternoon. And, wonder of wonders, they are filling it with a 90-day supply instead of the 30-day amount that up until now was the most that Medicare would OK.

I ate what I had to eat to feed the insulin and could not eat more or less depending on whether I felt like it, nor could I choose to skip a snack time or not eat if I went low.
Another possible reason for “insulin causing hunger” may not be due to insulin at all but rather amylin, since people who don’t produce insulin also don’t produce amylin, and amylin DOES have a profound effect on controlling appetite and satiety.

2519,"Daily foot skin moisturizing, a new habit",Treatment,Treatment,Terry4,4,"Many of us have attended diabetes education programs that included a whole raft of topics that impact our daily lives. Food, insulin, other medications, diabetes technology, and exercise are just the tip of the iceberg for all the things we need to know to live well with diabetes.
One of the items, foot care, at first seemed like one more thing tacked onto an already long list. I was taught early on that preventing foot injuries was key to heading off progression to an amputation.
To be truthful, while I tried to at least glance at my feet from time to time, I didn’t spend as much time, however, with any sort of daily ritual to care for my feet. I have always seen a podiatrist on a regular basis but that was at most a four or five times per year.
A few months back, as I was sitting down to put on my socks and shoes, I noticed that I had several small dry flaps of skin hinging from the side of my left heel. The heel and ball of my foot both had a layer of dry skin on them. Without thinking too much about it, I tugged at one of these dry skin flaps, hoping to remove it. Yikes! That was painful.
I put some neosporin lotion on the injury and placed a band-aid over it. Then I took down my copy of Dr. Bernstein’s Diabetes Solution to see what he had to say about foot care.

The nerves that stimulate perspiration in the feet are also affected. This results in the classic dry, often cracked skin that we see on diabetic feet. Dry skin is more easily damaged and slower to heal than normal, moist skin, and cracks permit entry of infectious bacteria.

I was surprised to read this close description of my situation. But I shouldn’t be as Dr. Bernstein’s book is comprehensive. And I should have reviewed this advice before I decided to put a band-aid over the skin injury created by tearing off that dry flake of skin. When I removed that band-aid after 24 hours, it started to pull up a layer of skin. Bernstein could have saved me that grief.

Do not put adhesive tape or other adhesive products like corn plasters in contact with your feet. Fragile skin might be peeled off when the tape is removed.

Well, I still had things to learn about taking care of my diabetes! I reviewed the rest of Appendix D, Foot Care for Diabetics, and saw Dr. B’s recommendation to lubricate the feet to alleviate or prevent dry skin and cracking.

If the skin of your feet is dry, lubricate the entire foot.Suitable lubricants include olive oil, any vegetable oil, vitamin E oil, emu oil, mink oil, and emulsified lanolin. […] Do not use petroleum jelly (Vaseline), mineral oil or baby oil, as they are not absorbed by the skin.

A month ago, I started to lubricate my feet twice per day, upon arising in the morning and before sleeping. I started out using an herbal salve found on Amazon, then switching to coconut oil, and finally another product I found on Amazon called CeraVe, a foot cream.
Progress has been slow but I’m starting to noticed some significant improvement. That layer of dry skin is more than 90% resolved and I now see a moist healthy skin layer reminiscent of a much younger me. I’ve also noticed an increase in sensation on the bottom of my feet. This makes sense as that layer of dry skin actually insulated my sensing nerves.
I’m embarrassed to admit that it’s taken me over 30 years to really appreciate the benefit of moisturizing my feet every day. Healthy skin on my feet not only resists infection but also enables me to walk every day for exercise. Exercise is fundamental to my diabetes management. I actually enjoy this daily ritual and I think this habit will stick.",Jan '19

Editor’s note: If you or a loved one are struggling to afford reliable and consistent access to insulin,  learn more about the options that exist here 5 .
Following an initial March 11, 2020 announcement of the new Medicare Part D Senior Savings Model, CMS today announced updates on the plan that will go into effect beginning January 1, 2021. The Model caps out of pocket insulin costs at $35 per month for seniors enrolled in eligible plans.
Earlier this year, insurance providers were invited to apply for inclusion into the cost savings model. For eligible plans, insulin manufacturers cover the cost gap in coverage to ensure out of pocket costs for insulin are no more than $35 per month regardless of whether the individual is in the deductible phase or Medicare Part D coverage gap. Historically, enrollees in Medicare Part D plans have seen significant fluctuations in insulin cost depending on the time of year or phase of coverage. This change will make insulin costs consistent and predictable for those that it impacts.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) states that “over 1,750 standalone Medicare Part D plans & Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug coverage have applied to participate in Part D Senior Savings Model, offering coverage in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico.” While Medicare and other governmental programs are – by law – barred from negotiating drug prices, this savings model is being made available through enhanced Part D programs offered through private insurance companies.
Right now, an estimated 58% of people currently enrolled in Medicare Part D are covered by plans that will institute the Senior Savings Model. During annual open enrollment from October 15 to December 7, 2020, anyone who is insulin dependent and enrolled in Medicare Part D will need to ensure their plan is participating in the Medicare Part D Senior Savings Model to receive the $35 monthly out of pocket cap. CMS plans to include a search option in their Medicare Plan Finder to help enrollees identify eligible plans during open enrollment.
The three major insulin manufacturers Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi have signed on to participate in the Senior Savings Model, meaning each of their insulins, including long-acting, intermediate-acting, short-acting, and rapid-acting, will be covered under the model.
Beyond Type 1 reached out to each company about their decision to participate in the cost savings program.

“Sanofi supports the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) insulin demo plan because it is consistent with our commitment of improving access and affordability for people living with diabetes. Sanofi volunteered to join the plan since there are shared contributions from both manufacturers and Part D plans to directly reduce out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries.”
“[Novo Nordisk is] pleased to be a part of this new Part D Senior Savings Model that helps lower what seniors pay for insulin, and we continue to call on all corners of healthcare to come together on affordability. No one sector can do it alone and we all need to work together and do our part. We’re committed to doing our part and continuing to find avenues to help those in need.”
“Lilly is very pleased to participate in this important model that will make insulin more affordable for seniors in the U.S. We’ve been working on insulin affordability solutions for many years, and this model fills a critical gap that remained in the system.”

Each of the company’s other insulin cost savings programs – typically for people enrolled in commercial insurance or without any insurance coverage – can be found here 3.
Enhanced Medicare Part D plans have slightly higher premiums (an average of $49.32 per month versus $32.09 per month 1) than the standard Part D plan, but offer broader prescription drug coverage. CMS notes that with the new price caps, premiums are expected to slightly increase, but it is not currently known by how much.
CMS also reports that those enrolled in a participating plan should save “an average of $446 in annual out-of-pocket costs for insulin.” For those enrolled (or soon to be enrolled) in Medicare who are having trouble with costs, some assistance programs 1 are available.
While the new model applies to a small part of the population, it reduces a significant burden for some of the most vulnerable members of the diabetes community: insulin dependent people with diabetes over the age of 65. The plan also creates a model for how copay caps may be done in future.
Insulin rationing due to unpredictable or inaccessible costs is dangerous for everyone with insulin-dependent diabetes, potentially leading to complications such as nerve damage, amputation, diabetic ketoacidosis and even death.

I’ve decided to go back to the pump after my MDI/Levemir/Tresiba trial and couldn’t be happier so far (until my sites start to fail that is). I qualify in March for a new pump through the provincial government and I’m evaluating my options which aren’t plentiful in Canada. I’m currently using a loaner Veo until then. I like the fact that the 630G is waterproof, but that’s about the only advantage I can see. It looks like more button pushes to do the same things as on my Veo. I’m wondering if I should just go with a Veo if they will sell it to me. I’m not a swimmer and water sports/beach days are so rare I probably would just use Levemir when they happen. I know the Omnipod is an option but I have one currently (which is why I’m using a loaner Veo) and decided after using it for a few years that a tubed pump is a better fit for me.",Jan '18

If you are in no rush and think the Tandem might be a good fit for you, the expectation is that Tandem will have approval to be marketing and distributing their Tandem t:slim X2 pump in Canada at some point during 2018.
But until it happens, it is still only an expectation.
In terms of Tandem and waterproof, I consider the Tandem to be as waterproof as any other pump.  Tandem has a water resistant testing/certification for 3 feet for 30 minutes (IPX7).  However on the phone with Tandem customer support, they specifically and directly told me they would replace the pump under warranty for any water related damage.  That is good enough for me.

Everybody has their own set of requirements.  Certainly if you know what you want it helps you make the best choice for you.
When we first switched from the Animas Ping to the Tandem t:slim X2, the cartridge change seemed a bigger deal.  Once we got used to it, it now seems to be a non-issue.  I am not sure how long it takes.  I take my time with it.
We are currently on our last supply box which uses the luer lock connector.  Our next box of cartridges/infusion sets uses the new t:lock connector.  Tandem states that the t:lock connectors will use 4.4 units LESS of insulin during the fill/prime process and decrease the time required for such by 30 seconds.",Jan '18

 Scott_Eric:

I like the fact that the 630G is waterproof, but that’s about the only advantage I can see


Well, another is the “Suspend on low” feature for preventing lows, which a lot of people love, but it requires using the Medtronic Enlite CGM system, which is not as accurate as either Medtronic’s own Guardian 3 or the Dexcom G5. The latter are about equally accurate in my experience, having used both, but Guardian 3 only works with the 670G.



 Scott_Eric:

It looks like more button pushes to do the same things as on my Veo


I count 9 clicks from waking the screen to Suspend (well, you can scroll some of that, but it’s slower). Which is, yeah, kind of a pain. But what really makes it art is that all that clicking gets you to a suspend-yes/no screen, and the $!!!#)&&#@ default is NO. I mean, come on–the fact that there even has to be that last little bit of safety theater is bad enough, but I’ve basically confirmed I want to do this multiple times just to arrive at this screen, and you can’t have it default to YES?
Same logic applies throughout the user interface. Bolusing has its own way of being extra annoying, because after you enter your data and hit proceed, it gives you a beep that you are going to instinctively recognize as saying “Doing it” but actually just means “Going on to the next screen, where you still have say ‘YES YES YES DO IT ALREADY!!!’” That last screen is where it gives you the option to do a Dual or Square bolus, so there’s at least some sense to it, but then don’t freaking BEEP just because I’ve arrived at that choice. I’ve had this thing for going on 6 months and I still  get caught out by it maybe 3 times out of ten. Where the real twist of the knife comes is that when it times out if you don’t click Deliver, it doesn’t just bump you back to the bolus settings you just entered; it makes you go through the whole thing again. And if that’s not enough, even more annoying–or at least ironic–is that once you’ve clicked into the bolus section, if you change your mind and back out, it beeps at you for doing that, too.
Ok, this is turning into a rant, but this is the kind of stuff that tends to not bug you so much at the beginning but gets more annoying the longer you live with it. Not to say I’d disrecommend these pumps, they’re pretty bulletproof-reliable, and the company isn’t likely to go belly up, which is an increasingly important consideration (I had an Asante Snap for a while, and being orphaned is no fun). But there are times when I wish I could be in a room with the UI developers and a baseball bat.",Jan '18
2559,Medtronic 630G,Treatment,Treatment,Scott_Eric,,"Yeah, all of what you just said is the reason I don’t think I want it. I can bolus in my pocket without even looking at the Veo which is one of my favourite things about it. It actually has the suspend on low feature, but I use a Libre (and Dexcom before that) and I’m not interested in that feature anyway. I still have my trusty blue Paradigm 722 in a drawer and it worked last time I tried it, maybe I’ll just use that until it dies if/when I have to give the loaner back - it had even less confirmation screens than the Veo!",Jan '18

I was on a Paradigm- the 523 for four years.
630- It’s big, it’s bulky, and yes more button pushes to deliver a bolus or look at the menu. Sometimes I forget the extra button push for blousing (guess our brains get programmed after 4 years on one pump) which results in no bolus for a meal. Bad news.
I didn’t think it was waterproof. I was told it is water tight. Meaning on a scale of whether electronics are waterproof or not 0-9 the 630g is an 8. Does anyone else have better information? I’ve dropped it in water, and had it in the shower with me (while not directly under the spray-no problem)
Did I mention it’s big and bulky? And the clip is not as secure as my old paradigm which means at the gym or just whenever I move a lot it often comes unclipped.
To me there is no compelling reason to start on the 630g by itself UNLESS you can use that as a platform to spring to the 670g. Why Medtronic even released it at all is baffling to me. Tandem makes a slimmer model and it sounds like you are happy with your Veo. The threshold suspend has worked wonders for me (lowered my A1c 1/2 point in 3 months), but I’ve been using Enlites for almost 3 years and have had good success with them (Even on my old paradigm 523). So for me that’s been okay.

 DrBB:

But there are times when I wish I could be in a room with the UI developers and a baseball bat.


I’d like to know more about this UI or user interface process especially when designing an insulin pump. Why do some decisions appear so poor to those of us who live with these devices 24/7, yet must have seemed reasonable, at least acceptable, to the actual decision makers?
I suspect that the UI budget is not very large and the competing engineering and regulatory requirements are valued more highly than the user experience. I think often times the company will offload responsibility for a poor UI onto the FDA. I’m not as likely to believe this deflection since the FDA in recent years has been doing their best trying to expedite their role in the introduction of new D-tech to people with diabetes.
This situation wouldn’t be so bad if large D-tech companies were able to iterate more quickly. As consumers, we see a new phone version come out at least once per year. Big D-tech companies like Medtronic seem to be moving quickly if they can introduce a new model every four years. That compounds poor UI decisions as it adds insult to injury.
For me, stepping into the world of do it yourself automated insulin dosing systems is an exhilarating experience as technical improvements debut several times per year. It’s like an alternate universe.",Jan '18
2565,Medtronic 630G,Treatment,Treatment,Dave44,,"EDIT:   The following info pertains to the MM 523 and earlier.  NOT the 551 or later, as I had written.
Besides UI issues, the thing I run up against frequently, using my 551, is that when I select a temporary basal rate & duration, as soon as I hit ACTIVATE, the pump will give me a tiny bit of basal!  I hate that when the whole idea is to slow my basal way down.  that little bit isn’t earth shattering, but to me, it’s bad programming.   Their excuse is that the pump needs to start calculating from “time zero”, how much and how often, to give the basal infusions.   The upshot is that if you were to program a temp rate (above zero),  change your mind and cancel that temp rate, then program another temp rate, you will get another initial basal infusion.
I hope I explained that correctly.   Basically, when you want very little basal insulin for a while, you are forced to receive an immediate bit of basal, unless you disconnect the tubing at the set for a few seconds, until the insulin has been delivered.   It’s hard to see it for low basal settings, but it’s there.",Jan '18

I agree, with the caveat that it may be the company doing things it thinks will mollify the FDA, particularly when introducing something new like the hybrid closed-loop, and that it’s not just the FDA they have to mollify; it’s also the medicos who have to like it or they won’t ok it for their patients. There’s no question that having to trust us to set our own doses of a dangerous drug 24/7/365 goes rather strongly against the grain for the medical profession–not for no reason, but there it is. So showing they’re bending over backward in the direction of safe safe SAFE is helpful there. A UI necessarily has a point of view built into it, and the more I use this one the more everything about it just screams “Look out–yer gonna hurt yourself with that stuff!!!”
From that p.o.v. the 670 represents a big step forward in their comfort level, in that it takes so much of the control out of the patient’s hands, and what control you do have is severely attenuated and girt round with protective spells and barriers. Probably the most conspicuous example is the fixed target of 120mg/dl. There are people who are getting 5.9 A1C’s within that restriction, but human variability means that for a lot of us–decidedly me–we need to be able to set that notional target lower in order to actually achieve it in reality. I’d almost certainly still be using auto if I’d been able to do that.
That was what finally decided me to switch out of auto one morning after about two months of struggling. I’d made a lot of progress but I still wasn’t back to where I was before I started auto, despite having to work at it a lot harder than I had with my manual pump. That morning my DP had ballooned back up for no apparent reason, reversing the progress I thought I’d been making in tweaking the thing, and I had to ask why am I having to work so hard for the mysterious Algorithm when I could do a much better job myself if I could just get my hands back on the controls?
The real kicker was that, having been at this for 34 years, I’ve been through 4 major regimen changes–R/NPH to basal-bolus MDI, MDI to a manual pump, and now a hybrid closed-loop pump–and each time the change has brought a greater sense of freedom, that I was better able to organize my treatment around my life and not the other way around… except for this last one. It really felt like a step backward in that respect. I felt like I was laboring to please my pump when it should be working to make me happier and less stressed about this disease. So I pulled the plug on it and went back to manual.
Better leave it there before going any further off topic. A lot of others have had a better experience with the thing. Look up Richard157 for a much more positive take. And of course YDMV as always",Jan '18

I know Tandem is not (yet) available in Canada.  As well, it sounds like the Tandem cartridge fill/prime may be a deal breaker for you, but I thought I would at least mention this feature on the Tandem t:slim X2 as it sounds like this is an important feature for you:

Description of the Tandem t:slim X2 “Quick Bolus” feature:

Setting up the Quick Bolus function enables you to deliver a bolus by simply pressing a button. It is a way to deliver a bolus by following beep/vibration commands without navigating through or viewing the pump screen.
The default for the Quick Bolus function is off. Quick Bolus can be set to either units of insulin or grams of carbohydrate. The increment options are 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 units; or 2, 5, 10 and 15 grams of carb.

[User Guide has directions for the initial configuration to enable this feature and select either carbs or units and choose the increment.  One time configuration unless you later want to change this.]
Below is how the quick bolus is used (after the initial configuration).



Press and hold Quick Bolus Button. The Quick Bolus screen will appear. Listen for 2 beeps (if Pump Volume is set to beep) or feel for vibrations (if Pump Volume is set to vibrate).


Press Quick Bolus Button for each increment until desired amount is reached. The pump will beep/ vibrate for each button press.


The pump will beep/vibrate once for each increment pressed to confirm desired amount.


After the pump beeps/vibrates, press and hold Quick Bolus Button to deliver the bolus.

I had mentioned Tandem switching to the t:lock (away from the luer lock) as an advantage in terms of the cartridge fill/prime.  (ie - uses 4.4 units of insulin LESS and is faster by 30 seconds - according to Tandem)  However, this same change has the disadvantage of now only allowing infusion sets to be used with the Tandem which specifically have the t:lock.  (ie - the cartridge must be able to properly connect to the infusion set).  Some people have mentioned not being able to find a particular infusion set they want which has the t:lock.

Keep in mind that steel sets are not supposed to last three days. The package insert for the Contact-Detach set says to change it out every 24-48 hours, and I imagine other steel sets say the same, since they’re all basically made by the same company. I see a lot of people posting about this “problem” with steel sets not lasting several days, but in my mind as long as these sets last 24 hours they’ve done what they were designed to do.",Jan '18
2573,Medtronic 630G,Treatment,Treatment,Frantastic,,"I live in Ontario and I’ve been on the Paradigm 522, then the Veo and the 630G since November. I didn’t have much choice with my new one as the Animas ones aren’t available and I’d have to pay too much out of pocket for the OmniPod. Besides, transitioning was easy since I’m so used to the Medtronic pumps.
It is bigger mostly because it takes an AA battery. When you look down at the pump everything is upside down. Clip is not as strong. I can’t hang it from the bottom of my nightie anymore. However, you can use the clip to open the battery compartment. Very cool.
With the older ones, I could easily look down and see the time. Now, you have to press a button to activate the screen.
The screen is amazing. Lots of different colours and easy to read. A big improvement.
I was excited about the waterproof aspect too. However, I’ve gotten conflicting advice from Medtronic staff and other pumpers. I was used to wearing my pump in an Aquapac waterproof case when I shower, because I like to take long showers. I hear, “Go for it! Wear it in the shower, that’s what it was designed for”. Then I hear, “You never know if the casing might be cracked and you don’t want to risk any water getting in”. So I still use my Aquapac.
If you can afford to use a sensor, then that is the biggest reason to choose the 630G. Many handy functions. If you don’t use a sensor, maybe the Veo would come out as a stronger choice.
One of my favourite functions is the preset temp basals. You can set the time and the level. I have one for afternoon of errands and one for when I spend the morning in bed.
I only half fill the 3.0 reservoir. So I have to wait longer when changing up. If you use more, then this wouldn’t be a factor.
There’s a lot of button pressing. Not a deal breaker for me. You get used to it. The chance to wear a pump really over-shadows this aggro.

Tidepool Completes FDA 510(k) Submission of Tidepool Loop 8
Nonprofit Tidepool completes FDA submission of Tidepool Loop, an automated insulin dosing app for iOS intended for the management of type 1 diabetes.

As a Loop DIY user for the last four years, I’ve enjoyed an extraordinary restoration of my quality of life. I’ve lived with T1D for 37 years. The metabolic sanity it gives me is immeasurable.

Built on the extraordinary foundation of the do-it-yourself diabetes community’s original Loop app, Tidepool Loop is a first-of-its-kind project to take a patient-led innovation and shepherd it through US FDA’s regulatory process with the goal to make the app more broadly accessible to people with diabetes and their clinicians. The app is designed to connect with a variety of compatible insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGM) to automatically dose insulin for the treatment of insulin-requiring diabetes in an effort to keep a user’s glucose within a desired correction range. The goal of the interoperable design is to provide flexibility for users and their healthcare teams to choose the compatible components to which they have the best access or with which they are most familiar using in managing their care.
“We are standing on the shoulders of giants — people in the open source diabetes community who believe management tools should work better together and created software for themselves and their community,” said Howard Look, CEO and co-founder of Tidepool. “Just two years from kicking off the project, we’ve taken that foundation and built a system we’re proud to put in front of FDA. We’re committed to working alongside the agency and our device partners to drive progress in the areas of device interoperability and access, and we look forward to FDA’s review.”

It would require that the current commercial players abandon any hope of their wish to maintain their proprietary commercial silos. The FDA’s enabling of the iAGC along with the pump and CGM standards makes this possible.

 AndreasD:

Is there anyone that has any inkling on how to increase the micorbolus-dosage?


When I was using the 670G this was a huge frustration for me, and I think still is for a lot of people. The one parameter you can control that has the greatest effect on this is AIT, Active Insulin Time. Supposedly it’s the actual insulin effect duration, but bears little relation to what you’d set it at for a standard pump. The logic is that a shorter AIT  permits a larger microbulus without the algorithm thinking you’re “stacking.” I set it to the lowest possible value, which was 2hrs, and that helped make the pump more aggressive about correcting highs, but still left me frustrated.
The other issue is that it uses a higher target for determining corrections than for general operations. Standard algorithm target is 120 but it uses 150 for corrections, then the standard algorithm kicks in and is supposed to take you the rest of the way. But it’s v-e-r-y s-l-o-w. This is not an adjustable parameter.
Generally the people who are happiest with this pump are the ones who were struggling to get down out of HBA1Cs in the 8s or worse. It’s supposed to get you into the sixes and a higher time-in-range. For me I was getting 6 or lower HBA1Cs and 90% TIR, which the 670 couldn’t do. So I went back to my old paradigm and Dexcom CGM.",6m

I’m on novolog right now and my observation when giving correction boluses is that usually around the 20 minute mark, I should expect my BG to start coming down or turn the arrows from rising to steady.  My feeling is and I can’t quite put my finger on it, is that by the end of the first hour, the correction bolus has done all it can and doesn’t have any effectiveness like its done it’s job and out of my system already.  I can’t seeing it last for 4-5 hours.  If my correction bolus doesn’t do a thing within the first 30 minutes, I basically write it off and do another stronger correction.  While it seems I’m stacking insulin because my IOB increases, that insulin dose is not effective.
I’m not sure whether its insulin brand related, but this is what I’ve noticed on novolog.

I think tail exists, but very small and not noticed.
If there are fats, proteins in meal, they usually take longer to digest, and do use up some insulin from bolus in the later hours.  Consider that those on low carb/high fat-protein, often bolus additional insulin to cover, using extended bolus.  Buts gets more confusing with IQ pumps also messing with basal at same time.",4d
2601,The insulin tail,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,Jag1,2,"I wish the insulin I took was at full activity at 20 min, and out of my system in an hour. But that is not my experience at all. For example, below is a graph of a one unit correction I took yesterday. I’ve had T1 for 46 years, and use Tresiba for basal.
You’ll see that I get almost nothing for the first 30 minutes, but activity getting into gear at one hour. But my BG continues to go down for a full five hours, though obviously the slope of the curve is highest for the first three hours.
I use Humalog. But I tried samples of Novolog, and found no discernable difference in speed or longevity, so I stayed with Humalog simply because it was easier not to switch. But if my insurer ever wants me to switch, I would have no issues with switching, because as far as I could tell, these insulins are virtually indistinguishable to me.

2605,The insulin tail,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,Terry4,3,"The insulin tail does indeed exist but can be obscured by many other factors such as:


An insufficient basal dose that correction insulin must backfill before any effect on BG is noticed.


Other hormones like cortisol may be in play causing a temporary increase in insulin resistance and masking the effect of a correction dose.


Nutritional absorption of high carb plus high fat meals which can act many hours after the meal. High protein consumption can exhibit similar effects.


Diabetes glucose management is not simply about an insulin and glucose interaction. It is the dynamic interplay of insulin, food, other hormones, variable insulin sensitivity, variable and/or poor insulin absorption at infusion/injection sites, sleep deficiency caused insulin resistance, stress, exercise, hydration status and more.

I had something similar happened to me recently.

It’s only in VERY recent years that the common Endo is believing you can stay in range post carbs.  Joslin and other diabetes innovators aside.  It’s also only in recent years that we’re starting to evolve away from the carb-heavy food pyramid guidelines.  Heck, we still see posts often here about “my endo/nutritionist/DE/fill-in-the-blank” says I need to eat more carb"".
The common doctor catering to diabetics is so scared of lows, that they EXPECT us to be high and out of range in the post-prandial.  Within two hours, though, the bolus should have you back in range.  Not necessarily at your target BG, just in range.  “Excellent management” used to be defined as obtaining 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol) within 2 hours of a meal.
I have the 5th edition of Pumping Insulin (2012, I think 6th is the most recent), and I feel like it is already largely outdated.  This is an image from the chapter about corrections:
Screenshot_20210103-0738471080×798 130 KB
You can see that the Goldilocks “just right” correction factor brings you down over the course of 5 hours, but should be leveling off around the 3-4 hour range.
In that example, the “too low” value still took them 3 hours to get back down to 100, but it’s too fast, because they’re going to continue dropping beyond that.  3 hours feels like a lifetime of elevated BG to me!  But that was before we had options to suspend basal.
Now, we’re seeing a lot more options to tightly control the numbers.  Low carb/moderate to high protein and fat diets, high carb/low fat diets, greater availability of CGMs, looping, commercial pump semi-closed loops, super-bolusing, etc…
We’re in a great transition where 100% TIR is actually becoming achievable  WITHOUT increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, but all the terminology and medical professional mindset hasn’t caught up yet.  I think it’s why there’s so much confusion now.  We’re really striving for perfection.

One thing that’s designed to help with the spike situation you’re describing is to use an extended bolus (assuming you’re using a pump), so the insulin’s effect curve is more spread out. Another is pre-bolusing, vs “super bolusing” (though I definitely do that too). It just does seem to be the case that it’s harder to chase down a BG that’s already getting ahead of the insulin than to get ahead of the carbs to begin with. That should help with getting your peak to arrive somewhere in the 140-160 range rather than 200+.
But another thing is a kind of pet peeve of mine, especially dealing with endo’s who are schooled in the literature but not living with the disease themselves. Which is that all these numbers tend to give a false sense of precision, like there’s some reliable formula for manually operating a system originally evolved to be governed by webs of biochemical feedback loops. It’s not like the numbers aren’t helpful as a general guideline, but they’re never going to exactly match what you experience in practice. For me, getting a “soft landing” after a high-carb meal in a reasonable amount of time is a combination of past experience working in concert with what my CGM is telling me in the present, and creating a kind of informed-intuition feedback loop in realtime. Because bodies are all different, not all carbs are the same, and other variables like stress can play a role. So knowing what the rule books say is a good place to start from, but in the end it’s always going to be an empirical process, not a cut-and-dried mathematical one.",6d

Good point and a very informative post, as I have come to expect from you @Robyn_H. One thing I want to mention—and I know not everyone is a fan, but—Jardiance. It’s off-label for T1, but my endo started me on it about 2 years ago and it has had a huge effect on limiting my peaks and valleys, and dealing with the issues that are the subject of the OP.
No side effects I’ve ever detected, and since I started on it I’ve had A1C’s below 6.0 for the first time in 37 years with T1. It seems to have a general, overall effect of attenuating my BG curves, so that they’re oscillating within a much tighter and lower range over all. Way more useful in that respect, with much less aggravation, than what I found when I tried an AID system (670G).",6d

Now, I recognize that we do live with diabetes and this comparison may seem unfair, but I think it helps illuminate just what the ideal should be.
In this NIH study, Continuous Glucose Profiles in Healthy Subjects under Everyday Life Conditions and after Different Meals 2, they showed what the CGM trace after meals looked like.
Screen Shot 2021-01-03 at 9.43.15 AM1548×1270 183 KB
In non-diabetic people, the post-meal trace average rises just above 120 mg/dL for breakfast and just under 120 for lunch and dinner. Following all three meals, the BG falls to under 100 mg/dL at two hours. (IG=interstitial glucose)
Insulin acts during the 5-6 hour period after sub-q injection, whether its injected for a meal or for a BG correction. Its action is weighted in the early portion of that time. Two hours is an arbitrary time-mark that some use to aid analysis.
It might seem unfair to compare people with diabetes to non-diabetics but I think knowing what the ideal is can help us. If we’re going to shoot for a target, I think it’s helpful to aim for a beneficial one.
With limited carbohydrate diets (or high carb, ultra low-fat), adequate pre-bolusing, consistent daily exercise, and an automated insulin dosing system, I think it’s possible to approximate the post-meal blood glucose levels of non-diabetic people. In fact, many adherents of the Bernstein protocol consistently achieve this goal using multiple daily injections.
In the graph, you can see the 2 standard deviation traces above and below the average or mean. Since so many non-diabetics are not metabolically healthy, these excursions provide an interesting comparison. It seems people with T1D could reasonably produce post-meal traces within these limits.
In the ideal, I seek to limit post-prandial BG traces to 140 mg/dL at one hour and 120 mg/dL at two hours with a drop to below 100 mg/dL soon after. I can often do this.",6d

 Robyn_H:

I feel like this 2 hour/4 hour thing is old Diabetes theory still lingering. It’s only in VERY recent years that the common Endo is believing you can stay in range post carbs.


Great explanation.  I’m curious what the graph looks like for others when they eat and bolus for a slice of wholemeal bread.  I guess the thing I’m trying to work out is is my pattern “normal” or have I got something wrong (be it bolus, basal, correction factor).  I did ask my DE and she basically said I’m doing well with my control with my latest Hb1AC and TIR and not to get too hung up about the post meals.  But that’s like a typical response for a DE that doesn’t have diabetes, inside me I’m thinking it’s these post meal control that I’m battling with all the time, and I would like to get to the bottom of - be it that I’m doing something wrong or have the wrong expectations.



 DrBB:

One thing that’s designed to help with the spike situation you’re describing is to use an extended bolus (assuming you’re using a pump), so the insulin’s effect curve is more spread out. Another is pre-bolusing, vs “super bolusing” (though I definitely do that too).


I’ve tried both actually, I find that the extended bolus have very little effect.  Maybe its the amount injected every 5 mins is so small its not able to put a dent on a rising BG - and I find with novalog this often happens.  If I make the dosage higher for my extended bolus, I feel I’m injecting so much more insulin.  If I set my initial dose lower (say 60% as opposed to 80%) to allow for more insulin delivery in my extended bolus,  I find my BG shoot up high very quickly, so a very steep incline on the graph.  And then I start to battle with insulin resistance bringing down the BG.

I think you are right, it probably comes from a non diabetic pattern and probably is the best target to aim for.

For this, I think we should be comparing apples to apples in terms of food.  If this is the graph for a non diabetic who has eaten a full plate of pasta, I’m interested to see what it looks like for a diabetic eating the same plate of pasta.   Is this 2 hour mark achievable using insulin?  And I mean for most diabetics not just a small minority.  If it is achievable, then the 2 hour mark is a realistic benchmark.
For me specifically, I can’t seem to get this 2 hour BG decline back to or close to target BG.   It could be the way my body reacts to carbs or maybe my dosage is wrong (my DE hasn’t called out any concerns with my dosage) or a number of other factors .
This is achievable even for me with a protein meal, but I’m interested whether others have any success in bringing down the BG in 2 hours after eating carbs.",6d

I decided 8 years ago that I could not consistently get my insulin dosing correct if I wanted to continue to consume a high carb diet. I knew that I could occasionally get the insulin dose size and timing right but if I miscalculated my overall insulin sensitivity, insulin to carb ratio, or some other unknowable physical x-factor, then I was put into play like some pinball subject to the chaos of a risky and high stakes game.
With the exception of those who eat a high carb ultra low-fat diet, I don’t think T1Ds can eat a high-carb high-fat diet, the Standard American or Australian Diet, and consistently dose insulin well enough to achieve the post-meal glucose found in the non-diabetics in this study.
I was very reluctant to limit the carbs in my diet; I didn’t want to give up bagels and pasta. I thought of these kind of foods as contributing to my quality of life.
Now I wonder what took me so long. I much prefer the metabolic sanity I now enjoy compared to the metabolic mayhem I lived with for far too long. I’m no longer bloated, overweight, with a foggy mind.
Insulin dose size, timing, and attention to many details can only get you so far with regard to post-meal BGs. What you eat is crucial to hitting those targets.

2654,My first pump,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,SusanS,2,"I was just outfitted with my first pump 2 days ago. I went with Tslim X2 with Control-IQ. So, I have questions and come here seeking knowledge.
Maybe I went into this without understanding the dynamics of how the pump really works or maybe I have unrealistic expectations but, OMG, I am so stressed seeing my numbers after I eat! They are HIGHER than when I was injecting 6-8 times daily. Is this normal or should I be looking at other data to see that this is the correct treatment modality for me?
I have my first cartridge and tubing change tomorrow. I am mildly concerned. Is it normal to discard this much insulin? I currently have 145 units of insulin in the cartridge. It seems like such a waste. And, lets face it, insulin isn’t cheap. I have a $90 month co-pay.
I had 1 hour of training on this thing so I’m sure there is A LOT I don’t know. The clinical educator at the endo office could not get the Tslim to pair with my phone and connect to the TConnect app. Then again, he was genuinely confused when I asked him a question re: the pump and FOTF. He asked me what FOTF was. Makes me think maybe I should seriously consider getting my certificate in Diabetes Education. I called Tandem and they got me paired up to the app and running. The endo educator told me there were only three things I needed to know about/use on the pump. Oh boy. I feel woefully underprepared.
Last night, I told the pump the amount of carbs to bolus for my meal. The screen said “bolus infusing” and I put the pump in a shirt pocket (I stole hubs shirt…it’s huge on me. He’s a 5x but it had a pocket!). I checked after my meal and the pump said “Bolus not delivered”. IDK why. I really wasn’t sure what to do. My BG was already rising from the meal and wasn’t sure if I put the same number of carbs in the pump if it would cause a low or if IQ would adjust, so I told the pump 8 carbs less than I actually ate. What do you folks do when you encounter such issues? Why wasn’t the bolus delivered? What do you do if you forget to bolus before the meal?
I would appreciate any tips, tricks, advice that you, the community, has to offer this newbie. It’s silly things that trip me up…like getting dressed this morning. I had to laugh at myself holding the pump in my mouth because I had no where to put the thing! I looked ridiculous. I’m sitting here on the computer with the pump laying next to me on the couch. I didn’t think about the need to find pants and shorts with pockets. Duh. I guess I will have to alter my work uniforms too. They have pockets but I already carry three devices in my pockets for work as well as pens, markers, highlighters, scissors, etc.
I will stop here. It’s supposed to be a post, not a novel.",10d
2655,My first pump,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,5,"I’m going to throw a few things out there, but the biggest thing is to not worry yet.  There’s going to be a period of adjustment while you figure out what your settings should be.  Your Endo took a guess based on how much long-acting you were using, but our basal need vary throughout the day and with experience and data, you’ll be able to adjust your settings.
Can’t offer you any settings adjustments yet, but I will mention that Control-iq seems to work best when you lower your correction factor.  It helps the system curb highs and prevent lows better.  I would start out by adjusting it 5% lower right off the bat.  Such as, if you currently have 1 unit:50mg/dl programmed, I would change it to 1:47.5 .  You can see, it’s a small change.  It’s not going to matter much in the long run if you overshoot your target BG by 2.5mg/dl, but it empowers the system significantly.  You may ultimately make much larger adjustments, but that’s a good place to start.
Also, you don’t have to change your cartridge at the same time as your infusion set.  Insulin does degrade in the cartridge, though.  Most users report zero issues with a week of use, though.  What you do is just insert a new infusion set and remove the tubing.  You probably want to save it somewhere clean, like in a ziploc bag.  Plug in the old tubing that’s still connected to your cartridge. Now go into the load screen and do nothing but click on the “fill cannula” option.
Options > Load > Fill cannula > All deliveries will be stopped.  Continue?  ✓ > Start > ✓ in the top right corner > Resume insulin now? ✓
You likewise don’t have to change your infusion set when you change the cartridge.  That’s why you want to save the unused tubing.
I’m with you on the insulin is money thing, too.  There is actually about 15 units of unusable insulin left in every cartridge.  This is a complete renegade move and you’ll have to decide if it’s worth it to you, but a lot of us actually suck that 15+ units out with the syringe and add it to a new cartridge along with fresh insulin.  Insulin degrades, though, so this move has mixed feelings.  Personally, I don’t have any issue doing it.
Also, the pump doesn’t have to live in a pocket.  My preferred location is right between my breasts.  I can clip it to the bridge of my bra if I’m wearing one, or to the neckline of the tank I’m usually wearing wearing if not a bra. You can also clip it onto the waistband of your bottoms. You can buy or make waist pouches, garter belts, arm bands, etc…  Another lesser known option: Get yourself some baby socks, readily available at the Dollar store, and a safety pin.  Pin the sock inside any clothing item that doesn’t have a pocket, and slip your pump into the makeshift baby sock pocket.  Works best without the case on it.",10d

 SusanS:

Is it normal to discard this much insulin? I currently have 145 units of insulin in the cartridge. It seems like such a waste.


I consider it a waste and I have never discarded my current insulin reservoir when changing an infusion site unless the reservoir was empty. You can prep a new infusion set by skipping the “Change Cartridge” step in the “Load” menu. Just disconnect your old set, connect your new one and select “Fill Tubing”. At least that’s what I did for my last site change.



 SusanS:

I checked after my meal and the pump said “Bolus not delivered”. IDK why. I really wasn’t sure what to do.


Check the “History” section on your pump for error messages that might give you a clue as to why the bolus was not delivered. Also, double check your “Insulin on Board” (IOB) to double check how much of the bolus was delivered.
You can enter a bolus by simply specifying how many units of insulin you want to deliver. Figure out how many units you wanted to deliver to cover your meal, subtract any that may have already been delivered, and then just bolus that number of units. You do not need to specify carbs when you bolus.
The pump will treat it as a “correction” bolus, but that’s OK. This way you avoid double counting the carbs.",10d

I did not get any insulin the past 2 nights because my BG was in the 130s. Prior to starting a pump, my morning sugar was 110s to 130s. I have been 140s to 150s the past 2 mornings.

So first off, welcome to the pumpers club. And I hope you didn’t think it was the cure for all that causes you problems with your diabetes. It took me about 6 months to finally start feeling ok with it but that was 20+ years ago and things are a lot easier now.
And sorry about the post meal surprises. But that and overnight were the main reason for me to finally switch from 5 shots a day to a pump. I so wanted to have a baby. And thankfully the pump and a lot of hard work made that possible.
Hang in there. It will get easier. And remember what works for me might not work for you. Each of us is an experiment in the making. But I do really suggest asking for a one on one session with your pump trainer, not the sales rep. They have all the tricks that they have learned from others over the years.

It’s pretty obvious your basal rates are too low.  I think it’s normal for them to start low and increase it as necessary, though.  Doctors are much more afraid of lows than highs.  It isn’t a problem so much in the short term, but if they make you wait much more than a week to adjust your settings, it IS a problem.
We can help you right now with your morning sugars, though.
Did they not teach you about sleep mode?  Sleep mode was designed to give the pump tighter control while you’re inactive and fasting, because there are no other external factors to screw with your insulin needs.  It will aggressively adjust your basal to keep you between 112-120 all night.  You can turn it on by clicking Options > Activity > Sleep: START.  The regular Control-IQ algorithm won’t resume until you follow the same pathway in the morning and click “STOP”.  While you’re in that activity menu, though, you’ll see an option for “Sleep Schedules”.  You have two different setting options, such as one for weekdays and a different one for weekends.  Go ahead and set up a schedule now that will turn Sleep mode on and off for you automatically.  I would highly suggest you set a time that begins about 2 hours after you usually finish your evening meal and extends to your typical breakfast time (this will also help cover dawn phenomenon and FOTF).
Unfortunately, your pump is going to struggle to achieve that goal just yet because your basal rate is inadequate.  I’m not comfortable advising you to change that, but you may call and ask your endo or educator to increase it for you, or you can take it upon yourself to raise it.  It’s generally accepted that 5% changes are safe and acceptable.  You run no risk of severe hypoglycemia with just a 5% change if you’re already running high.
The one thing I WILL help you with now that will make your nighttimes better is getting your correction factor down.  This is the setting that enables control-iq to influence your BG.  The higher the number, the slower and milder the changes.  The lower the number, the faster and more extreme the changes are.  (Edited, because I suck at proofreading.  Thanks @irrational_John ) Too low is a bad thing, though, as it will overcorrect at both highs and lows, leaving you on a wicked roller coaster ride.
Too change it, you need to learn about your “personal profiles”.  This is where all your background insulin settings are.  You can have up to six different profiles, because our insulin needs aren’t the same everyday.  You might need/want a different profile for high activity days, sick days, weekends vs weekdays, etc…  It’s fine to start with just one, though.  You don’t know yet when that particular profile isn’t working for you until you have more time with it.  (Personally, I have 3.  My regular profile, one that delivers extra insulin for sick days, pms, etc…, and 1 that delivers less insulin for really high activity days when I otherwise might fight lows a lot.)
Click on Options > My Pump > Personal Profiles.
The first item on this list is “pump settings”.  There’s nothing too important in there other than it lets you customize how much insulin is delivered if you “quick bolus”, which I’m guessing they didn’t teach you about either.  I have mine set to 0.5 units.  If you hold the silver button until it beeps or vibrates (depending on your sound settings), you will see the Quick Bolus screen pop up.  Every further click of the button will tell the pump to deliver some insulin.  Since I have mine set to 0.5 units, if I want to deliver a 2.5 unit bolus, I would click the button 5 times.  The pump will then repeat 5 beeps or vibrations back at me and I will long press the silver button to confirm.  It’s easier than it sounds.  Do it a few times watching the screen and you’ll catch on quick.  This allows for discreet bolusing without even removing your pump, because you don’t actually have to see or touch the screen.
The second item on the list will be the only basal profile you currently have set up.  It should say “on” next to it.  Go ahead and click on it.  If you scroll down to the second page, you can rename that profile to something more helpful.  I would suggest “starter”, because you want to save the initial settings your doctor gave you.
Now scroll back up the first page and click “duplicate”.  This will initiate a new profile great you can tweak without affecting your doctor’s settings.  Click the check mark to confirm you want to do this.  I would call it something like “testing”.
Click anywhere in the box labeled “timed settings”.  This is the heart of your pump.  I’m guessing you only have 1 segment at the moment, starting at midnight.  Eventually, you will want to add other segments where you need different amounts of insulin, such as a higher one in the early am to account for dawn phenomenon, and then a reduced one the after the DP passes and you don’t need the extra.  You can see right in that 12:00 am box what the basal rate, correction factor, insulin:carb ratio, and target BG are set at.  If you want to edit it, click on that box.  Click on “correction factor”.  Whatever that number is, reduce it by 5%.  You can use a calculator if you want, (current correction factor value) x 0.95 = new correction factor value.  Once you enter the new value, click the ✓ to confirm.  Click the check again to save the new timed segment information.
Now, you need to actually turn your new “testing” profile on.  Click on “testing” (or whatever you named it), and then click on “activate”.  ✓ to confirm.  You’re now running your newly adjusted profile.
Note, I feel comfortable guiding you on this because it’s a SAFER option than the inadequate starter settings your doctor set you up with.  It will make Control-IQ better at preventing both highs and lows.  I also think it’s an option most professionals, except the very best, ignore.  Generally, they only change insulin values, even though it’s only one of many factors that influence pumping.  You should confidence to make small 5% changes, and see for a week or so how they work for you.",9d

OK. I have no idea how to make setting changes or what my settings are.


Here’s a link to a Tandem vid about setting up personal profiles.
Getting Started with Personal Profiles on the t:slim X2
Editing your pump settings is not that hard to understand, but it can be a tedious process. Just something we all have to deal with. 
This video discusses creating the very first profile on the pump. Since your trainer already set that up, it is too early for you. But it will you point you towards how to view or edit your profile on your pump.
I suggest before you change your profile settings you first duplicate (copy) them into a profile with a different name. This saves the old settings for future reference. It also makes it easy to switch back to the old settings should you want to.
Always look at the date of any tutorial material you come across. In my experience the older Tandem stuff can be out of date. As it updated the pump’s software over time, Tandem also changed the pump’s menus. Older educational material may still be of use to you, but it won’t necessarily match the screens of the t:slim x2 you are using. You’ll need to allow for that.
Tandem also has a collection of user guides & Quick Reference sheets in PDF format which you can refer too. For example, here is a link to the quick ref for t:slim x2 user profiles.

Nice to know that I’m already (self)trained.  
I guess I just have a different perspective than many others. My first pump was a MiniMed 507 which was delivered to me along with supplies in December 1996. Included with it was a book containing a number of articles about using an insulin pump. After reading through some of the articles and the pump’s documentation, I took a guess at a basil rate, filled a cartridge with insulin, slapped in an infusion set and started using the pump.
A week or three later I went in for an appointment with the educator at the office of the doctor I was seeing then. She was surprised when she found out I was already wearing/using my pump. That was how I first found out that folks are supposed to be “trained” to use a pump.
Oh, well.  She handled it well which I am grateful for in hindsight. ",9d

To go in a slightly different direction, I’m curious how much use you are making of your Dexcom G6 CGM. Were you using a G6 before you got the t:slim x2 pump? How do you view your CGM data? Is it just via the t:connect app or can/do you also use the Dexcom app to monitor your G6 sensor?
All I recall you saying about t:connect is pretty much the excerpt below.

I realize that the cgm needs 2 calibrations per day


Just a reminder. When I was using the Guardian 3 CGM with a 630G, you were required to calibrate every 6 hours for the first 4 (I think) calibrations immediately after the initial sensor warm-up. Calibrations were every 12 hours only after this roughly first 24 hours of more frequent calibrations.
I assume this was because the sensor had still not reached a sufficient equilibrium and needed more frequent calibrations to stay on track. I found this annoying, sure. But my primary goal was to be able to trust my CGM results so I just worked with it.
Maybe it will be different with the 770G. I have not seen any feedback about this from 770G users so I just don’t know one way or another.",5d

2708,G6 requiring calibration too often,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,Tnyc,,"Of my last 12 G6 sessions, 7 have required calibration.  What happens is that after the warmup the G6 requests two calibrations, then it requests 1 calibration after the first 12 hours and then 1 calibration every 24 hours for the rest of the 10 days.
In the 5 other sessions, it never requests a calibration for the whole 10 days.  As far as I can tell, my “manual” (requiring calibration) sessions and my “automatic” sessions are both quite accurate.
I always use my iPhone to start the sessions and I always enter the code by taking a photo.
Does anyone have any tips for reducing the number of “manual” sessions? I’m thinking of entering the codes by hand rather than taking a photo although I can’t imagine why that would make any difference.
I’m afraid I don’t have any data, and I could be misremembering, but my sense is that when I first got the G6, it truly was calibration free but that there have been more calibration sessions in the past 6 or 8 months or so.

As for anything a patient might say on the issue can likely be disregarded.  If any one knew what is coming, I likely would and while I do not know it all, I can assure you that I do not know what features might be coning or when.
I can say that I am very happy to have requested an upgrade and am looking forward to getting an upgrade to the 770g.  I hope that no matter what choice you make, that your choice will be wonderful.

2738,T:slim X2 has different IOB values if CIQ enabled/disabled?,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,irrational_JohnType 1 or LADA,,"Here is an example of what I’m confused about.
When CIQ is active my Tandem t:slim x2 shows my IOB as (for example):
“Insulin On Board 2.43”
If I turn off CIQ without changing anything else then this changes to:
“Insulin On Board 3.71 4:31 hrs”
The (Insulin) Duration time in my pump’s personal profile is set to 5:00 hours. So it matches the duration value which CIQ ostensibly uses. Because the configuration is the same I expected that the pump would calculate the IOB the same way whether or not CIQ is turned on. 
Does anyone know why on earth turning CIQ on results in a lower IOB value? This makes no sense to me. 
Also, why does the pump display the “time remaining” for IOB when CIQ is turned off but does not show the remaining time when CIQ is turned on? What’s up with that?",7d
2739,T:slim X2 has different IOB values if CIQ enabled/disabled?,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,Robyn_H,,"Tandem made a revolutionary change to the insulin decay model when they introduced Control-IQ.  It more closely resembles how insulin is actually used by the body.
Previously, every Pump to my knowledge used a linear decay model:

You used up insulin at the same consistent rate. We basically set a number for DIA willy nilly based on when we FELT the insulin was no longer effective.  Usually somewhere between 2.5 and 4 hours, after the major insulin peak wore off.  But it wasn’t true… There was always a long-acting tail that wasn’t accounted for and our insulin usage is ANYTHING but consistent.
With control-ig, Tandem changed the decay model to be an exponential decay with a delayed start.  I don’t have a specific picture from Tandem, but the graph is going to look a lot more like a rollercoaster.  Starting out at the baseline, peaking activity 30 minutes after bolus, then slowly tapering off to zero at the five hour mark.  It’s actually approaching zero for a very long time, hence your pump will display 0 IOB long before the 5 hour mark, and really aligns well with anyone previously using a DIA between 2.5-3.5 hours.  It’s also why they locked the DIA in at 5 hours, because they don’t expect us to understand the change they made here.

EDIT:  Came back to say that the very first section of this graph isn’t a true representation, just the closest I could find.  The start of the graph actually should be up high, even with the peak, but it doesn’t really start to significantly decay until after 30 minutes or so.
You can see how the new model better aligns with real insulin usage:

There are other complications with Control-IQ, because it is often adjusting your insulin.  If it delivers a correction bolus or increases your basal, it will add the extra insulin to your IOB.  If it suspends delivery or reduces basal, it will subtract that insulin from the IOB.  The ticking clock telling you when your bolus expires is no longer relevant.  Your IOB is now a living value telling you and the pump exactly how much potential the insulin you have onboard has to lower your blood sugar.
However, the moment you toggle Control-IQ off, it reverts back to the old linear decay model with the ticking clock you define.",7d

My understanding is that Medtronic pumps use a non-linear decay model. Most likely a polynomial 2’nd or at most 3’rd order approximation. I’m surprised that Tandem would still be using a linear model. 



 Robyn_H:

My perspective is that, technically, basal insulin should not be included in the IOB since it is intended to mimic the steady state trickle of a normally functioning pancreas.
However, CIQ probably has to somehow add basal amounts that exceed the basal rate specified in the personal profile as IOB. But I wouldn’t expect it to subtract amounts that weren’t delivered. They simply wouldn’t be added to IOB total. No?",7d

I stand corrected.  I had to research this more.  Apparently the 670G does indeed use what they’re calling a “curvilinear” decay while in auto-mode, so I’m sure the latest pumps do too…  It’s only Omnipod that’s strictly linear now.  It’s all very proprietary, though, because this insulin decay model is what’s setting the new automated systems apart.  I’ve been struggling to piece together my knowledge from various sources and paint an image others can understand.
Outside of pump automation, though, you literally just set a time all your insulin supposedly disappears.  So the point still remains outside the latest models.",7d

Because the article is over 10 years old it refers to pumps that are no longer with us. But the paragraph below seemed to confirm my recollection that Medtronic pumps use a non-linear algorithm.

Medtronic  (and  all  other  pumps  that  we  will discuss)  calculates  IOB  using  an  algorithmic equation so as to match the normal ebb and flow to  insulin’s  activity.    Only  a  small  amount  of insulin  is  used  up  during  the  first  30  minutes,  a great  deal  is  used  up  during  the  next  couple  of hours, and only  a small amount is used towards the end of the insulin’s action curve.

Tandem partnered with Type Zero to fine tune the decay algorithm for Control-IQ, and it is different than previous software models.  Omnipod is working with Tidepool to figure out their take on it, and Medtronic is doing their own thing…  They’re all new, different, and diverging.  Notably, unless you have absorbancy issues, 5 hours DIA is too long on older pump software. 3.5-4.5 hours is generally recommended, and tweaked from there.

But I’d also point out that you referenced the 670G and seemed to imply that non-linear was new & unique to the newer pumps and algorithms. That is not how I understand it. Medtronic was apparently using non-linear IOB in it’s Paradigm pumps 10 years ago. This is why I’m really surprised that Tandem would still be using non-linear outside of CIQ.

Previously, before using t.slimx2 with CIQ, IOB was very important to me for calculating corrections to avoid stacking. Since I use Sleep Mode 24/7 and CIQ does not give corrections, I was trying to base my corrections on IOB but found that there was no consistency to the number and, of course, no time indicated.

I’m half-guilty of over-simplifying things, Your knowledge base is more extensive than your question indicated to me.  And also, I learned some new info myself this afternoon.  The article I was reading when I conceded on the “linear” point was comparing the Omnipod, 670g, and X2, hence my specific mention of the 670g…
I honestly did not know pumps were previously using “curvilinear” instead of just linear.  In all my readings and conversation I’ve heard them referenced as simply “linear”.  It’s honestly splitting hairs, though, and I can see why it’s been shortened.
Curvilinear is still a simple equation.  It’s still a defined rate that expires at a specific time.  The Control-IQ algorithm is different.  A 10 unit bolus will last longer than a 0.5 unit bolus, because of the exponential decay.  The closer to the five hour mark you look, the more similar the two boluses will look.  But if you look at other time segments, the difference will become apparent.  The 0.5 unit bolus will quickly devolve into an IOB too small to register, which is displayed as “0”, whereas you’ll still see IOB at the 3 hour mark after the 10 unit bolus… Plus/minus whatever changes CIQ made to your delivery.",7d

Yep.  It is highly variable.  Like I tried to explain earlier, it’s a living value now.  Constantly changing.  The clock doesn’t matter.
It is indeed still useful information, though.  If anything, it should be easier for us.
Let me ask, why does the time the insulin was delivered matter to you?  I unit is 1 unit, and carries the potential of your correction factor, so why does the clock matter?  Do you place different value on the IOB if it was delivered at different times?  Have you from previous years of experience learned that the IOB display is more accurate at some times than others?  I’m assuming the answer is something along the lines of “the previous decay models were inaccurate, but I’ve learned to accommodate for them.”
Control-IQ has made advances to correct that notion.  It is all about insulin potential now.  If your correction factor is 1:50, and the IOB says 1.5… you currently have enough insulin POTENTIAL on board to bring you from 175 to 100 mg/dl.  You don’t have to stop and fret about exactly when that insulin was delivered, so you can determine it’s value.  Most of that IOB was probably from your bolus, but some of that insulin was delivered repeatedly every 6 minutes as basal adjustments.  There’s no one single clock counting down.  A new clock starts every six minutes, and they all run simultaneously.
The IOB indicated the value of insulin in your system that is in excess of your basal, not just simply your last bolus.  IOB is reduced if basal is withheld, because that  suspension reduced the BG-lowering potential of all the insulin in play at that given moment.  Likewise, IOB increases if extra basal is given, because you now how increased potential to lower BG.  We’re blurring the lines between defined basal and bolus roles.",7d
2749,T:slim X2 has different IOB values if CIQ enabled/disabled?,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,Willow4,,"@Robyn_H, it is not the time of IOB that matters to me but the amount. And the amount seems to vary constantly. Yes, the amount may be enough to bring me into range at one point but several minutes later it may not be right and may in one instance bring me low, in another, leave me higher than I would want to be. I suppose the thing to do is not to correct myself. However, the range I strive for is not the range that CIQ is set for.
I am in the process of following your suggestion to adjust the basals as soon as my new CGM transmitter arrives. Had a bad one and no backup and have had a dumb pump throughout the holidays.

I also suspect you’ll gain more confidence in trusting the IOB once your settings are situated correctly.  I think your correction factor probably still needs tweaking if you’re getting erratic results.
You might also just be overthinking it.  I think we sometimes run into a problem with being TOO informed and trying to out-think the technology.  Remember, this stuff is written to bring good control to the average user, not as carrot dangling for the privileged.  They’re putting in more effort on the design end to require less thinking on the user end.  Could you try just giving the IOB a little blind faith for a bit? Maybe only give corrections with the bolus wizard, and let it do the thinking?
Also, I’m under no disillusion that Control-IQ is perfect.  There are significant changes coming in the near future, and maybe you’ll be more satisfied then.  I don’t think you’ll ever see the return of the countdown timer, though.  I don’t think it’s feasible when the system is always changing your IOB.

2752,G6 app bug blocks alerts,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,Edward_Reid,,"I’m interested in whether others have encountered this bug in the G6 Android app, which has almost bitten me several times, and possibly bit me bad once.
I’ve observed it a number times in the previous version of the app. I’ve seen enough to know that it also appears in the recent update (v1.8). I’ve pretty sure it also occurs in the receiver. I have no way to check the iOS app.
Report it? I did report it to Dexcom, but customer support is a brick wall trained never to bother software development. I’ve told my endo, who was surprised.
OK, I’m not intentionally being coy, just wanting to set things up right.
Problem: if a fast fall alert is ignored three times (or maybe it’s four), then that alert stops sounding, and more critically, blocks a low alert.
Lots of qualifications there. But “blocks a low alert” should get everyone’s attention.
Start with the fast fall alert. Probably all Dexcom users quickly learn that it doesn’t much matter whether you acknowledge the alert. Unlike with a low alert, if the fast fall condition still exists five minutes later, it will sound again right then. So shy bother? Whether it sounds again in five minutes depends not on your action but solely on whether the condition continues to exist.
But there is a difference after it sounds three (or perhaps four) times without acknowledgement. At that point it blocks. You can see one result in this screenshot of my lock screen: The alert is for a fast fall at 171, but the current reading is already down to 139:
1080×2220 171 KB
This is actually 15+ minutes after the alert – I also have screen shots where the current value was 160 and 150. Normally the alert would be updating the bg value every 5 minutes. And though the screen shot does not include sound effects, I know that the fast fall alert had been sounding until my bg reached 171, and not afterward.
Eventually the alert will sound again if the fast fall continues to exist. I’ve seen it happen but have not ascertained how long it takes. Fifteen minutes would be consistent with other parts of the app.
Now, that’s bad enough. In an extreme situation, the app could be giving you fast fall alerts at 170 and go silent until you reach (say) 100, still in fast fall.
But even scarier, that locked fast fall alert doesn’t just block subsequent fast fall alerts. It also blocks the low bg alert! So – with my settings of 2 for fast fall and 90 for low alert – I could have a readings sequence of 130 (start), 119 (FF alert), 108 (FF alert), 97 (FF alert), 86 (low and fast fall but NO ALERT), 75 (ditto). I’m down to 75 in fast fall and the app is silent.
I do not know whether an urgent low ALARM could also be blocked. I really don’t want to do the experiment necessary to determine.
I assume all the above stuff also happens in reverse with fast rise and high bg alerts. Those don’t happen to me as often and I pay them less attention, so I haven’t documented them. (As they say, low bg is dangerous on a time scale of minutes but high bg is dangerous on a time scale of years.)
This MAY have contributed to a nasty episode on August 26, 2018.After eating a large mango, my bg was 350, so I took 2 units of Humalog – no more because I was leaving on a bike ride. At the time I was using the G5 receiver, After a few minutes it started buzzing fast fall, but this was OK because I was so high. About 40 minutes later, the last thing I remember is pulling off the road into a sidewalk. A few minutes later a passerby called 911, and I woke up looking at an EMT. While my analysis pointed at a perfect storm of about half a dozen causes, I was not then aware of this possible additional cause: if the fast fall and low alerts were blocked, I may have continued riding when I should have stopped and guzzled the glucose syrup that was in my pocket.
This of course depends on the receiver having the same bug as the Android app. I keep trying to turn on the receiver when a fast fall is expected, but I have not managed to turn on the receiver at the right moment. But otherwise they seem to work identically except for parts of the UI and capabilities the receiver simply lacks.",8d

In my experience if the app has already told you that you are either going to be low soon or are falling the low alert will not sound but the urgent low will still work.
I had a pretty bad low once from this quirk where I was woken up by the urgent low soon alert, I treated it with glucose and went back to sleep but I remained low for a considerable amount of time without getting any more alerts until by BG was 55 and dropping. I too called Dexcom about this but didn’t get a satisfactory explanation either. All I was able to determine is that it wasn’t considered a glitch.

My ‘fast fall’ alarm (via the app) is set to a police siren, so I tend to stop what I’m doing and acknowledge it. Except when I’m out walking the dog near the police station. I have, several times, assumed that it was an actual police siren sounding in the distance and didn’t recognize it was a Dexcom alarm. In that case, it did sound a multitude of times. That’s how I eventually realized it was a Dexcom alert.
I’ve been having a bunch of highs, so I think I could easily run some tests.
Do we have any well thought through test conditions for this event that would help clarify things?",7d
2755,G6 app bug blocks alerts,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,Edward_Reid,,"Test conditions: the problem for me is that the test conditions are situations I try to avoid.  Fast change, especially when nearing a limit.
I suppose I see it most often when my bg has been high and I finally get it dropping. If it’s well over 200 when I first get the fast fall, I can let it sound several times before I take action. That was the case in the image I posted.
Letting it fast-fall down to my low alert setting is scarier. And of course I can’t predict exactly when it will get there. Sometimes I’m trying to catch it happening, but then either the locked alert times out first, or it stops dropping so fast, and I don’t get an observation.
A fast rise of course is less scary, but in that case I’m likely to be trying to treat even more quickly – I can stop a fast fall pretty reliably with a big gulp of glucose syrup, but a fast rise can take longer to deal with, depending on what caused it. (One thing I find interesting about CGM is seeing the result of taking glucose – a fast rise that suddenly peaks and stops.)
I suppose what would help clarify the most would be if I stopped and made notes when I started getting a fast change alert. The reason I’m not certain how many alerts are needed to block is that I forget how many I’ve ignored. 
That’s funny about the police siren. I tried a lot of sounds and returned to the defaults – at least they are the defaults IIRC – because a scale (up or down) for fast change and an arpeggio (up or down) for breaching the limit has an easy-to-remember symmetry for me. I save the siren for urgent low – it seems to be able to awaken me even when I’ve slept through the milder alerts. ",7d

153 (alert sounded, did not clear)
143 (alert sounded, did not clear)

I did nothing to stop the fall until after the 129. IOW, I cannot plan on any event continuing. But the situation at 136 demonstrates the problem; it should have sounded again. (For those who don’t use the fast-change alerts, they appear to be based on an average of the past three intervals. Thus the drop from 143 to 136 is still in fast-fall because of the previous two intervals. I’ve seen cases where the last change is a rise – have taken glucose – yet I get one more fast-fall alert.)

It appears to me, and I may be mistaken, that the real source of your problem is excessive swings of blood glucose. Is this happening every day or several times per week? Perhaps this only occurs once per month. Please forgive me if this does not apply in your case.
Since you use the Dexcom G6, the standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation % (CV) measures provide information about your glucose variability. High glucose variability has been demonstrated to go hand in hand with an increase in hypoglycemia.

2778,Unexpected Sensor Disconnections With 670G & Guardian 3,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,K_Good,,"So short stats, pump user for 20ish years. Have primarily used MiniMed, but had a time with Animas.  I have been a data nerd (15 to 20 manual BG readings per day). and excessive record keeper. I have a background in statistical analysis.  My control has been very good to excellent over time.
My take on the 670G  system at this point mirrors some of the comments in this thread, though my conclusion may be somewhat unorthodox , but follow me for a moment.
The sensor/transmitter, pump combination is the first generation of one companies attempt at a hybrid “closed loop” system.
The pump part of this system is fairly mature at this point, the stepping motors have gotten better able to deliver smaller and smaller amounts of insulin. The upgrades in pump technology has certainly allowed diabetics an opportunity at better control.
Medtronic has always offered terrific support, though now it seems they ARE following a script for the calls.
I have had my run ins with short sensor life (one lasted an entire thirty hours!), and multiple calls to the help line, at all hours of the day. I have had no trouble getting sensor replacements for my short lived sensors, using the initial online reporting that is allowed and followup calls.
My feeling about the entire system is that all of us using this system specifically the CGM are, that unwillingly, the current users, are still part of a beta test group.
I would like to tell Medtronic that I have incurred significant expenses to use their system, and if we are part of their product development they should minimize our costs. The original FDA approvals were certainly done in a clinical environment with little if no costs to the participants
My data, which used to be my own, is now visible to them, without using my password. I am sure that I “allowed” their access by signing in initially.
Medtronic has recently announced a collaboration/partnership with Dexcom, among others. This seems to be a tacit acknowledgement that there are better CGM platforms and that the next generation will abandon their own for a better one.  When and if that happens, sign me up, though I cant afford another sizable financial investment at this point.
I understand that we are all on the cusp of significantly better control. I was seduced by the idea that I might not have to put so much effort into my care, even if for a short period of time
When this system works well, it is effortless, but given all of the issues reported here, if you are able, sit tight, for the next generation.",Sep '19

I don’t know what your problems were with the Tandem, or which model you had. But the 780G is supposed to fix the one thing that made the 670 a failure for me and many others, namely that the target BG for the algorithm was fixed at 120. This resulted in A1C’s in the neighborhood of 6.9 (per their own FAQ), which was no good for those of us with much tighter control than that (though people habitually running >7 generally liked it). The 780 by contrast will allow you to set the target as low as 100, which should make it much more responsive in correcting highs and allow you to achieve results more like those of us who are used to getting high-5/low-6 A1Cs.
Re the Guardian sensor system and all that annoying over-taping crap: that’s also supposed to be done away with in their next version. So yay. I think it’s supposed to also get rid of the 2x/day calibration requirement but don’t quote me on that.
Of course if they really had a sudden attack of sanity they could ditch their kludgy CGM system entirely and just open compatibility with Dexcom.

I’ve been a Dexcom user for 8+ years and earlier this year started using the G6 with my phone.  It started out as a great system where I could get my readings on my phone vs carying an extra device, and plus no calibrations are great as well.
Now for the warning…my app has been bugging me for a couple of weeks to upgrade and I’ve been putting it off.  I was about to do it tonight but glad I hesitated after reading feedback on Google play…it appears that the new version 1.8 will not allow the app to work unless you allow it to lambast you with notifications!  In other words,  gone is the ability to manage your readings without annoying vibrations and beeping.  With my current app, I could disable notifications so not to be bothered while in critical meetings or formal events.  From my understanding, the new version does not allow users to stop notifications else you won’t get your glucose reading!  There are times when I run low but know my level will rise after I just ate a few glucose tablets but I’ll have no choice but to listen to the dexcom beeps until my numbers rise.  Sorry but I am thoroughly disgusted with this change.  ONCE YOU UPDATE YOU CAN’T GO BACK TO THE OLD VERSION.
Others are annoyed that it constantly requires users to allow location information…not just when checking your level.  Any other app makes this an option, not a requirement.
Hope this helps others avoid this repulsive requirement.

Additionally, here are a few reviews I saw on Google Play:
""on a samsung note 9, the current update overrides the dark mode preference on the quick glance feature. this wasn’t an issue on the previous version. it also overrides the disabling of the “BEEP BEEP BEEP” urgent low sound. again, this was not the case with the previous version and is insanely annoying. please, please, please patch this as it wakes me up at night. i’ll update my review to 5 accordingly, please for the love of god just change it to the way it was. please and thank you""*
“Works good, but beware of permissions on the phone. Up until recently I could set my phone to Do Not Disturb when i went to bed. I am lucky enough to wake up if my bloodsugar is out of whack, however, after the app has updated I can no longer use the DND in order to keep the app quiet. I cant tell the app that it’s not exempt from DND, because then it wont show me any glucose levels, so now I need to turn off my phone at night, but my phone is my alarm clock… not ok…”

2820,Wait before you upgrade app to dexcom 1.8,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,TedK,1,"Sounds good.  I’ll do the forced stop if I need a situation where I require no alarms.
Compared to before, it was much easier to treat with appropriate amount of food, then go back to bed vs listening to beeps until I got back to normal range.  Now I’ll be forced to shut down the app and also lose the ability to know where my levels are until I re-start app.
The ability to avoid the upgrade now seems to be a moot point as it appears Dexcom is forcing everyone to upgrade by 1/6 based on my screen shot.  I’m hoping there is enough dis-satisfaction expressed with the new requirements, that they revert back to the previous settings.
I’m a stock holder in DEX (albeit not a large amount) but know there is competition on the horizon from Abbot’s freestyle Libre 2.  It provides reading every minute vs every 5 but every 5 is just fine by me.    The greater difference is an 4 extra days (14 total) with the Libre.   If their app is less annoying, it would make it worthwhile for me to change over, once available in the US.  The G6 is very easy to install a sensor and virtually pain free for me, so Libre would need to be similar to convert.
Regarding the blue tooth constant location tracking requirement, there is no need for this unless Dexcom is selling your location tracking information to other organizations in an effort to make money.  Perhaps as a supplement to lost dollars from competition?

Check your history for alerts.  Should alert about a week or so before 90 transmitter days.

I hope Tandem will add feature to see days used in T:Connect nstead of just status of “battery ok”.  I mentioned this on last call.
Search for restart sensor, and you will find instructions on removing transmitter.

Same exact way you’ve been doing it, except this time you you need to change the transmitter ID on the pump and your phone.  It’s just not in any of the official protocols since according to Dexcom, you can’t restart.  Normally you would have to call Tandem for a replacement sensor, because theoretically, that sensor can’t be used once you get the “cannot start new session” error, because it’s full of a dead transmitter with no way to remove it.
Of course, we know better.  So when you get the error, just pop the old transmitter out, change the ID in your settings, and insert the new transmitter into your existing sensor.

G6 Transmitter Removal without breaking the sensor

G6 transmitter removal without breaking the sensor
When the transmitter is nearly done for, a sensor change will elicit a warning “this is the last session with this transmitter, make sure you have another on hand”. I think that it then will not allow you to start another new session with the same transmitter, EVEN IF that sensor fails early.
That’s how it’s supposed to work. It appears to be purely based on time since activating the transmitter, not on measurement of the battery condition. Sometimes the transmitter battery dies early. In this case you get a “transmitter battery critically low” alert. When this happened to me a few months ago, it only lasted a couple more hours.
If this happens, Dexcom will replace the sensor, since you cannot [are not supposed to be able to] put in a new transmitter with the same sensor.
However, the transmitter is guaranteed for only 90 days despite normally lasting for 110 days. A few months ago, my transmitter failed at 91 days. Dexcom replaced the sensor but not the transmitter. (I already had a new transmitter and sensors on hand, so it was an annoyance but no gap in coverage.)
Just a few days ago, my transmitter failed (“battery critically low”) at 58 days during a sensor swap. I explained that I didn’t lose a sensor, but they are shipping replacements for both sensor and transmitter anyway. I guess they just assume that “battery critically low” means a lost sensor.
Just recently – past couple of months I think – I no longer have to wait on the phone to report early sensor or transmitter failure. The last two cases, I just filled out the support form online. With the simple sensor failure, I also had to respond to an email with a couple of other questions – just the basic questions they ask on the phone. With the transmitter failure, I did not even have to do that.
I’m not sure how the above needs to be adjusted if you have restarted a sensor. I gave up on restarting because I seldom get good results after a restart. For me, sensors fail at 8 or 9 days about as often as they go a full ten days. I have built up a few to experiment with as a result …

2854,Glimpse the future,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,Terry4,12,"With the appearance of continuous glucose monitors (CGM), like the Dexcom G6 that don’t require daily fingerstick calibrations, many people have fallen out of the habit of using a fingerstick meter to manage their glucose levels. I’m testing a lot less frequently than I used to but there are situations where a confirming fingerstick saves me a lot more trouble than it creates.
I’ve been struggling some with a trend of lows around midnight, a few hours after I go to bed. These lows often require more than one glucose treatment. I think they are caused by basal rates set too high, something I now call a “basal low.” We all know the feeling of just wanting to handle this situation quickly so that we don’t fully wake up and then face trouble getting back to sleep.
Making the effort to do a fingerprick is the last thing you want to do. I often just eat a glucose tab and roll over. Unfortunately, these lows have been more persistent and 15 minutes later, the alarm is sounding again. I’ve learned from experience that I can cycle through the alarm, treat and another alarm cycle until I treat one too many times and my blood sugar goes high for the rest of the night.
Two nights ago, I was woken up with a low alarm (65 mg/dL), treated with one glucose tab and rolled over. Fifteen minutes later the urgent low 55 mg/dL alarm sounds. I then thought, ok, maybe I am indeed low and need another glucose tab or perhaps my first treatment just hasn’t metabolically registered yet.
Reluctantly, I dragged myself out of bed and stuck my finger – 90 mg/dL. So my suspicion was confirmed, I returned to bed without another glucose tab, no more alarms and I woke up in the morning at 93 mg/dL. I would have been so easy to eat another glucose tab (or two!) and return to sleep and bounce into hyperglycemia for the rest of the night.
In these situations, I think of a fingerstick as a way to look 15 minutes into the future. It’s not really the future but a CGM often lags a meter by 15 minutes.
I find this framing makes it easier for me to find the energy to do the fingerstick and make better informed decisions. Instead of feeling like I’m burdened with this additional task, I see it as an opportunity to see into the future and make a better call.
As humans, we have this incredible ability to reframe reality and instead of changing any of the facts in a situation, we can see it from a different perspective and make better decisions.
It’s a small thing that has helped me. I now see my fingerstick meter as a magical tool at times that can allow me to see 15 minutes into the future. It makes those difficult midnight decisions a little easier. Anyone else use this technique?",Jul '20

 Marilyn6:

I think you can just attribute this to the nature of diabetes. My recent dive in BGs around midnight seemed to come out of nowhere and I’m still trying to figure it out. I think the important thing is to accept any new trends quickly and experiment with tactics to address it.
The simple analysis for lows is that we are getting too much insulin. The harder job is to try to figure out how much to reduce and when. That includes deciding how much to take off of the basal insulin and how much the bolus dose.
In my case, I’m getting a build-up of insulin on board during the pre-bedtime hours and I think that leads to a hypo-effect around midnight. I am going to make my evening meal (which I eat at least three hours before retiring) insulin dose more aggressive. I can’t believe that I’ve been working on this for a few weeks now. It seems like a relatively simple challenge but the solution has been evading me. I will persist!



 Tapestry:

How many blood tests (finger sticks) do you think you’ve done since you made the switch from G4 to G6?


My fingerstick rate of testing has remained unchanged during the G4 to G6 transition, about five tests average per day. Some days I don’t poke at all and other days might mean 10 checks. In order to feed BG data to Loop during the two-hour sensor warm-up period, I stick every 20 minutes. I also add meter checks when I know my sensor diverges from my actual BGs. I don’t think skimping on test strips for economic reasons is a good idea, but I think insurance companies ceasing strip coverage is reprehensible.
While I disagree that payors stop coverage due to paying for CGMs that do not require calibration, I will self-fund if need be. Strips can be purchased for about 20 cents each and I think $1/day for five strips is worth it for safety and health. I still get strip coverage under my Medicare Part D coverage; I think the Part B coverage has dried up for most people who use a no-calibration-required CGM like the G6.



 Jim_in_Calgary:

I’m in the camp of not wanting to change to G6 because of cost if for no other reason.


I’d still be using the G4 if Dexcom didn’t cut me off from the data stream needed to run Loop. I know I could have changed to the G5 but sense that I won’t be too long until that option expires. Canada, of course, will operate with a different schedule.

I am also exercising after both breakfast and lunch. Instead of 1 hr after breakfast I am splitting the time. I think that is the biggest recent change I have made.

This came at the perfect time for me because for the last almost two weeks I have been woken up by my CGM alarm. I have glucose by the bed so, same as you I take a correction then roll over only to be woken up again. My meter, that I still use because for another week I am on the G5, is downstairs so like you I have not wanted to bother.
I determined that my basal doses (twice daily) were too high so I have been gradually decreasing and then checking before bed. I have found, at least with my G5 experience, that sometimes the sensor goes off on a tangent and does not at all reflect reality so I have learned to check with a finger stick occasionally especially when my body sense does not match the sensor reading.
When I was relying on finger sticks only I kept a meter by the bed as well but with the CGM the strips might go beyond their usefulness if I am only using them on occasion instead of 10+ times a day. My wonder is, why? I eat a modified keto diet, am a habitual intermittent faster and snack only to keep from going low if I am. I had wondered if, with the immune strengthening regime I do, that maybe my reluctant pancreas is helping out again, albeit slowly.

I find that I can’t quite trust even the Dexcom sensors, because they seem to give me consistently high readings.  The sensor starts out 20-40% higher than the Contour Next, and then just stays there at the same elevated level (consistantly, for hours) unless I calibrate. Once calibrated, the Dexcom either falls in line for the rest of the 10 days, or slowly drifts back up after a few days.
I am reminded of the study that someone mentioned here a while back (can’t remember who) where it was found that your A1c result is skewed by how well your hemoglobin fuses sugar to itself. Two people with the same average glucose can be several points apart on test results (like 6.8 vs 6.5).  I’m beginning to wonder if the same is true of blood glucose vs sensor glucose.

I think that this is prob the safest thing to do. But, if you can tolerate running a little high, there is value in only changing one technology at a time.
I, personally, could not tolerate running into the 300’s and would prefer to be on syringe insulin over that.
Since you, like me, are prob pretty hyperglycemia adverse, you need to be super careful about those pump settings without a CGM (especially because of the covid stuff - you can’t have a diabetic LOW BG emergency now). Be careful, man, whatever you decide. I’m a litte superstitious about the holidays and medical emergencies, so I won’t advise you to change those pump settings until either after the new year, or you have a CGM and a weeks worth of data.

2883,"New to using pump, struggling with getting help",Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,Terry4,3,"If I understand you correctly, you’re trying to transition to the pump from a multiple daily injection (MDI) regimen that was volatile with swinging glucose levels. I sense the missing ingredient in this effort is the knowledge needed to set up and then adjust pump settings to home in on your optimal insulin needs.
If it was me in your situation, with an unresponsive doctor, I would switch back to your more familiar MDI protocol and back off a little on your dosing. In other words, maybe take a unit or two less of your long-acting insulin and bump up your insulin sensitivity factor (correction ratio) making it less aggressive. For example if your ISF was 1:30 (1 unit drops BG 30 mg/dL) then set it to 1:35 or 1:40.
Even though you do not have your CGM yet, you do have a fingerstick meter. Is that right? If you want to learn about how your body’s glucose metabolism works, then liberally use your meter and keep a hand-written log of the results.
Have you read any books about using insulin? Think Like a Pancreas by Scheiner, Using Insulin and Pumping Insulin by Walsh, and Sugar Surfing by Ponder are all worthwhile books to dig into. While all our modern diabetes technology is wonderful, real long term success using the tech is dependent on your human software.
I understand that you are a T1D. Is your doctor’s practice primarily T2D? If this is true, then he may not be conversant in T1D dosing techniques. T2D is a different disease and requires different tactics. Perhaps your doctor’s non-response is because of a lack of confidence to offer detailed settings advice.
My personal opinion is that it’s an unusual doctor who will provide the close daily feedback needed to get a patient well started on a pump. Even once per week advice is not nearly enough. When I sensed this non-support early in my diabetes career, I decided that my knowledge was paramount and these moment to moment diabetes decisions were best left to me.
Once you gain the needed knowledge, you then gain incredible insight to your unique metabolism. A CGM is fundamental to this effort but many well-timed fingersticks can help a lot while you wait for the bureaucracy to grant you a CGM.
Good luck! Investing time and effort into your diabetes knowledge will pay you valuable dividends over your life. I’ve personally sensed that my knowledge of my glucose metabolism has left my endocrinologists far behind. I’m sometimes a bit shocked at how much my endos don’t know. But then I realize that we diabetics live with our diabetes 24/7/365 and endos are only on the job part-time.",17d

I’m not sure what my doctor’s primary practice is. He has his main practice in a different state, and is only near me once a month for a week or so. But, he’s the only endo near me. So, yeah.
I’ve got a good batch of records that shows I’m consistently higher than I should be. I’m taking a hybrid approach at this point where I’m using the pump and injections.

In order to do well on a pump, you need to be able to detect a need to change a setting and make that change when it’s needed. Diabetes is dynamic, not static. Here’s are some items where your knowledge needs proficiency.


Temporary basal rates


Extended boluses


Combination boluses (some now, some later)


Testing and setting basal rates (good for defeating dawn phenomena, if needed)


Insulin sensitivity factors, also known as correction ratios (ISF can vary through the day)


Insulin to carb ratios (also can vary through the day)


Understanding IOB, insulin on board


Insulin duration


It could help you while you’re trying to make these adjustments, as you’re learning, to limit your carbohydrate intake. For example, instead of bowl of oatmeal with fruit in the morning, eat bacon and eggs without juice, toast or potatoes. Or a cheese omelette with salsa  or veggies if you don’t fancy meat.",17d

I wanted to mention, you could reach out to the author of “Think Like a Pancreas,” as he has a practice which works remotely.  I “bolded” some text so it would stand out better for you.

2892,"New to using pump, struggling with getting help",Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,DrBBType 1 or LADA,2,"I transitioned from basal-bolus MDI to a pump about 10 yrs ago, under the guidance of Joslin. Hoo boy were they incremental about it. Which makes sense, up to a point. A pump is not a one-shot dose of Lantus and you can get into trouble. Which is why these days they shouldn’t even be sold without a CGM as part of the deal, and they weren’t standard-issue back then. So I felt much more dependent on the guidance than I would now. But after about 3 weeks of that I eventually just had to take control and start adjusting my basals myself. That’s when I started getting results in line with my pre-pump numbers only without quite so many hypos to get there.
Lessons learned:

All MDs fear the hypo more than the hyper.
Even endo specialists see way more T2s than T1s, and can be hyper cautious around insulin delivery systems just out of lack of experience. That goes triple if you’re dealing with a GP, which was all I had for the first 20 yrs (see YDFLNCA in the acronyms glossary)
If you’re reasonably careful (lots of finger sticks, alas, since you don’t have a CGM), you should be able to get it better dialed in on your own, and once you do the results should speak for themselves when you finally get back in touch with your endo.  They really can’t expect you to just be on hold for that long given the numbers you’re reporting.
The advice of setting temp basals experimentally and adjusting your settings accordingly seems like a great way to do it.

2901,Returning Tslim insulin pump,Diabetes Technology,Diabetes Technology,mohe0001,1,"The way to think about your dosing would have this:
Most of the time, when we talk about basal rates, we are talking about an amount of insulin that is delivered over the course of an hour.  But, when we talk about your dose, its only being delivered over 15 min, so its 1/4 of the amount of insulin (15 min is 1/4 of an hour).
Typically, A basal rate of 1 means that we deliver 1 unit over 1 hour. A basal rate of 2 means that we deliver 2 units over an hour.
You were delivering insulin over a much shorter time period - a quarter of an hour (1/4 of an hour).
So, instead of delivering 0.1 units per hour, you delivered 0.1 x (25%) = 0.1 x 0.25 = 0.025 units per quarter of an hour (15 minutes). So, you have to divide the dose by 4 to make it the same as how we usually talk about it.
There are 4 quarters in a dollar. You were only delivering a quarters worth of insulin.
So, 0.1/4 = 0.025
0.025 is 1/4 of 0.1
image780×663 48.1 KB
If, instead, you delivered that same dose (0.1 units) over 30 min, or 1/2 an hour, then
you would need to divide 0.1 units by 2.
0.1/2 = 0.05 units
Twice as much time = twice as much insulin.

They also realize that their 670 system wasn’t cracked up to what it is supposed to be. It needed 3 or 4 fingerstick calibrations for the sensor to be accurate. It locked people out of automode, The new pump will also have an adjustable  target and automatic corrections if carbohydrates weren’t calculated properly. Sounds very promising indeed.

Most of the time, when we talk about basal rates, we are talking about an amount of insulin that is delivered over the course of an hour. But, when we talk about your dose, its only being delivered over 15 min, so its 1/4 of the amount of insulin (15 min is 1/4 of an hour).


Her normal dose using Medtronic pump is delivered over hour.
The issue is that tslim pump requires a minimum .100 data entry per segment basal rate.
It allows .101, allowing .001 precision above .100.
To mimic what Medtronic pump can do, she was using 0 segments + .100 segment.  Her total basal is unusually low.
She gave it a good try, but its fault of pump to not allow segment less than .100, when the micro-delivery can deliver .001 per pulse.",Jul '20

And, as was pointed out, you could alternate with a basal of 0 for short periods of time to achieve a lower effective rate. Furthermore, I seriously doubt a Medtronic pump could accurately or reliably deliver a dose so small.
As far as converting fractions to decimals is concerned, get a calculator. Enter a 1. Divide by 4. There, you have your entree for 1/4th.

Good for you for adopting this tactic. It’s not always convenient when the blood sugar decides to go higher and you’re ready for some down time.

My purpose in starting this topic is to open a conversation surrounding the belief that diabetes, particularly Type 2, can somehow be prevented from developing in the first place, by following a “healthy lifestyle” (the meaning of which is an entirely separate and contentious topic on its own). My opinion is that diabetes cannot be prevented. Such a belief serves to further “The Blame Game” and more than implies that PWD are somehow responsible for the development of their own disease.

Since we don’t truly understand the detailed etiology of T2—it is essentially a diagnosis by exclusion—we are, in effect, guessing when we say that this or that protocol or lifestyle adjustment does or does not “prevent” diabetes from developing.  There are numerous examples people can quote one way or the other, but you can’t prove a negative; if someone hasn’t developed it yet, that does not support peering into the future and prophesying that they never will.

While I don’t really see the link myself, I think that environmental pollution offers an excellent parallel analogy.  Individuals don’t tremendously pollute the environment on an individual basis, but each and every one of them is a part of the society that does.
As the way we’ve lived our lives, eaten, and worked has changed, over the past several generations, diabetes rates particularly type 2 have skyrocketed.  I don’t need to be a researcher to see that.  I don’t need to be a meteorologist to declare that it’s raining either.
The individual feels blamed in all of this, which sucks, and they shouldn’t— they’re not making choices to sit at a computer all day for a living instead of herding cattle and building things like their grandfather did-- that’s the world they live in, they didn’t make those choices, those were the choices before them.

Following is a definition from Cambridge Dictionaries Online:
prevent
verb [T]  US    /prɪˈvent/
› to stop something from happening or someone from doing something:
The police tried to prevent him from leaving.
Can this type of accident be prevented?
preventable
adjective  US    /prɪˈven·tə·bəl/
›
Fortunately, the suffering caused by ulcers is entirely preventable.
prevention
noun [U]  US    /prɪˈven·ʃən/
›
crime prevention
(Definition of prevent from the Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary © Cambridge University Press)
So, with this definition in mind, I will repeat my original question:
Can diabetes, particularly Type 2, be prevented from developing in the first place by following a “healthy lifestyle”, i.e. eating a diet that contains a moderate amount of carbs, healthy fats, healthy sources of protein, dietary fiber, limited in content that is processed, and containing all the recommended amounts of vitamins and minerals (or however a reasonable person would define a “healthy diet” without the need to “operationalize” the definition) and adhering to an exercise plan that includes both aerobic and resistance (muscle-building) exercise (meaning what most people would consider as being non-sedentary and not extreme, again without the need to “operationalize” the definition).",May '16
2958,“Preventing” the Development of Diabetes?,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,yourhanner,2,"So, I think there are more questions that necessarily pop up:


Does “prevention” mean forever? Does it mean that, by following a diet and exercise plan such as you’ve described, the person would never display diabetic symptoms?


Or does prevention mean using lifestyle choices to avoid medications to treat diabetic symptoms? If that is the case, have PWD who treat with only diet and exercise actually prevented diabetes? What is the difference between a PWD controlling with diet and exercise vs a person “preventing” diabetic symptoms with diet and exercise?

May I share something with you all so that you might understand my internal frame of reference?
Many years ago I read a book named The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey.  One of those habits was “seek first to understand, then be understood.”  The foundation for “seek first to understand, then be understood” empathic communication.
Stephen Covey stated that empathic communication is powerful because “it give you accurate data to work with.  instead of projecting [my] own autobiography and assuming thoughts, feelings, motives and interpretation, you’re dealing with the reality inside another person’s head and heart  You’re listening to understand.  You’re focusing on receiving the deep communication of another human soul.”
It is with the above internal frame of reference that I respond to the discussion question.
I believe if “lay people” have an idea how a clinician “operationalizes” a word or a term and the clinician understands how the layperson is “operationalizing” the word or term, it can serve to be a preventive measure in reducing the likelihood of me or my audience “assuming thoughts, feelings, motives and interpretations.”
When I share my head and my heart, it is my hope that you will not have to guess about my position…  As such here is how I am operationalizing “prevention” for the sake of this conversation as per Taber’s Medical Dictionary:
Primary prevention:  Limiting the spread of illness to previously unaffected patients or populations.
Primary prevention (nursing):  Nursing care aimed at general health promotion.  This included whatever intervention is required to  provide a health-promoting environment at home, in the schools, in public places, and in the workplace by ensuring good nutrition, adequate clothing, and shelter, rest and recreation, and health education (including sex education, and for the aging, realistic plans for retirement).  Changes in  lifestyle through behavior therapy, though difficult, must be attempted with respect to those areas known to represent major health risk factors (i.e., smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, improper diet, alcohol and drug abuse, etc.
Secondary prevention: Limiting the impact or the recurrence of an illness in patients already afflicted with it.
Tertiary prevention:  Nursing care for patients with incurable diseases, and patients instruction concerning how to manage those conditions and diseases.  Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and cancer are conditions the lend themselves to tertiary prevention.  The goal is to prevent further deterioration of physical and mental function, and to have the patient use whatever residual function is available for maximum enjoyment of and participation in life’s activities.  Rehabilitation is an essential part of tertiary prevention.
I hope that give you all a peek into how I operationalize “prevent” “prevention” “prevention” in my world.

My opinion is that diabetes cannot be prevented.


Can diabetes be prevented? I believe the answer is yes, no, maybe and sometimes. I give that confusing answer because the question has not yet been satisfactorily answered. If someone claims to know it is their opinion talking and not the facts. Since the cause is not yet fully understood how can we make assumptions about prevention.
Because we do not truly have the answer it is just as damaging to tell someone that it is not preventable. It is wrong to dash someones hopes by telling them that they have no chance. Some people believe that if you can’t beat it why bother, why let that sentiment come onto play over an unimportant technicality.



 rgcainmd:

Such a belief serves to further “The Blame Game” and more than implies that PWD are somehow responsible for the development of their own disease.


The blame game is going to continue no matter what someone believes on this subject. You can be blamed for not preventing the actual disease or you can be blamed for not preventing the progression of the disease, it really makes no difference because you have been blamed.
The way to stop the blame game is to teach understanding of the disease, not by trying define it out of existence.",May '16

Some people would still get diabetes regardless of lifestyle, diet, etc. Some people might delay diabetes by 10 years. Some people would never get diabetes regardless of how they lived and ate.
Unfortunately most of the time people wouldn’t know which of those segments that they fall into. But if many people can improve their BG numbers by losing weight, exercising, and eating little junk food, then it stands to reason that if they had always lived like that, they might have prevented diabetes or at least delayed it by many years.

True, universal prevention based on knowledge of the underlying mechanisms(s) will have to wait for further progress in the science.
But wait . . . there’s another joker lurking.  Since we’re reasonably sure the current epidemic is due to some change or combination of changes in circumstances, don’t totally discount the possibllity that as science, culture and society continue to evolve, new triggers may appear.

On the other hand, I don’t believe we know what to do to reliably prevent it on an individual level. I think we need to change society on a massive scale and then fewer genetically vulnerable people will develop the disease, but I don’t feel comfortable telling people “if you exercise, eat fruits, veggies and fish, lower calories, don’t smoke, and avoid processed carbohydrates you will not develop the disease.” I suspect a lot of the disease is a result of our post-industrial diet, which has destroyed our microbiome over 4 generations.

Does It Matter When You Exercise?
How the time of day you exercise affects blood glucose
Link to full article at bottom of page
You’ve probably heard that exercise aids diabetes management. It’s true: Moderate aerobic exercise—the kind recommended 30 minutes a day, five days a week—can help you lower your blood glucose.
And exercise has benefits beyond blood glucose control, says Michael Fowler, MD, assistant professor of medicine and director of diabetes outreach at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “[Regular exercise is] highly, highly, highly beneficial in folks with type 2 diabetes,” Fowler says. It lowers risks of cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes. The cardiovascular protection is less well proven in people with type 1 diabetes. “But we know that exercise, for everybody, makes our bodies more sensitive to insulin,” he says. That includes any insulin the body makes or that a person injects. Greater sensitivity to insulin helps the body use it effectively to lower blood glucose levels.
You may wonder when to fit workouts in and whether the time of day you exercise makes a difference in blood glucose levels. Let’s take a closer look.
Around the Clock
Whenever you can move your body—a 20-minute walk in the morning or playing catch at night—it’s good for you and your diabetes, says Sheri Colberg-Ochs, PhD, a fellow with the American College of Sports Medicine. “The best time is when it fits in your schedule,” she says.
Avoiding Lows
Of course, during and after exercise with diabetes, some people face the risk of blood glucose going too low. That’s more likely to happen if you use insulin and sulfonylureas, which can put you at greater risk for lows overall.
One thing that may help you manage blood glucose during and after exercise is to set a regular time for it. A consistent exercise routine, says Fowler, can help you learn more about how exercise affects you. “What we typically recommend is that somebody does exercise at the same time—that way things are more predictable. If it’s going to cause low blood sugar, they learn how to predict it or adjust to accommodate [that].”
So let’s rock around the clock to see what you might expect with regard to your blood glucose and exercise, keeping in mind, as always, that your response may vary—from other people’s and from day to day.
Morning
Some people like to rise and shine. And this can be a good time to exercise to combat what—for some—are the day’s highest blood glucose levels. During sleep, the body typically maintains blood glucose levels by making hormones that tell your liver to release glucose. The body with diabetes often needs help from insulin or other diabetes medications to make sure the liver doesn’t produce too much glucose, which can result in high blood glucose overnight and on awakening in the morning. Plus, the dawn phenomenon—thought to be the result of a normal surge of hormones that the body produces to kick-start the day—may also raise blood glucose levels.
Non-Insulin Users: Teresa Anderson, 45, of Myersville, Maryland, fits fitness into her schedule by working out first thing in the morning. “It’s what I can stick with. That is the key,” says Anderson, who has type 2 diabetes.
Insulin and Sulfonylurea Users: Talk to your doctor about what to eat before and after morning exercise and how to adjust insulin dosing and food to avoid lows.
Before Meals
Working out before a meal can be a great way to fit in some exercise. And while you may not see as much of a drop in blood glucose as at other times of day, it’ll still do your body good.
Non-Insulin Users: If you don’t take insulin, you probably need no extra preparation when exercising before a meal, says Colberg-Ochs. “The main effect of working out pre-meal—other than breakfast—may be a slightly lower rise in blood glucose after eating,” she says.
Insulin and Sulfonylurea Users: If you frequently go low while exercising, it may help to exercise before meals instead of after meals, when bolus insulin or pills that cause the body to secrete insulin are the most active. Fast-acting insulin injected or pumped for your previous meal takes about four hours to be cleared from the body.
After Meals
Working out increases your body’s insulin sensitivity, making it easier for insulin to transport glucose to the cells that will use it. So working out after a meal can be a good way to “use up” excess glucose after eating.
Non-Insulin Users: “I test after I exercise. I noticed that my numbers were definitely lower [after working out],” says Jacquelyn Weller, 37, of Reed City, Michigan, whose after-dinner exercise helps control her type 2 diabetes. “When I saw the numbers, I kind of celebrated a little bit. It really pushed me to make sure that I keep exercising so that I keep seeing those numbers.”
Insulin and Sulfonylurea Users: Do exercise safely: Carefully monitor your blood glucose during and after post-meal physical activity to avoid surprise lows. “Generally, if you’re really worried about hypoglycemia, avoid exercising within two hours of a meal,” Colberg-Ochs says. This tends to be the time that injected or pumped mealtime insulin is most plentiful and active.
At Night
Any exercise, no matter the time of day, is a good idea. Be aware, however, that working out at night can interfere with your sleep—which can affect your diabetes. The Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School reports that the body secretes the stress hormone cortisol during exercise. That activates your brain’s “alerting system.” If you want a good night’s rest, make sure to finish your workout at least three hours before bed.
Non-Insulin Users: Working out at night should not increase hypoglycemia risk for non-insulin users, says Colberg-Ochs.
Insulin and Sulfonylurea Users: Exercising too close to bedtime can be risky. When you’re asleep, you may not feel a low coming on. So, if you’re an insulin user who wants to work out at night, you’ll want to carefully monitor blood glucose before, during, and after exercise and before bedtime. A snack before you go to sleep may be a good idea. You’ll also want to check blood glucose in the middle of your sleep time (say, 3 a.m.), at least a few times while developing a regimen to be sure you’re not going too low. Talk to your doctor about the best hypoglycemia prevention approaches for you and your routine.
The bottom line? There’s no best time of day when it comes to exercise. Pick a time that works for you and just do it. As Cynthia Zuber, 39, of Minneapolis, has found, consistency is key. She prefers to walk after meals, but the timing is less important than doing it nearly every day. “For me, a walk is the perfect balm,” says Zuber, who has type 1 diabetes. “If I walk three miles a day, diabetes is so much easier to manage. I always try to get that movement in.”
Anaerobic Exercise
Different types of activities will affect your blood glucose in a variety of ways. We’ve already talked about aerobic exercise, but anaerobic exercise, or strength training, can increase your adrenaline, and that can raise your blood glucose. The same goes for interval training, including workouts such as CrossFit, and activities with short bursts of intense activity, such as basketball or hockey, says Jen Hanson, RKin, MEd, a registered kinesiologist and executive director of Connected in Motion, a Toronto nonprofit designed to get people with type 1 diabetes involved in adventurous exercise. Hanson, 31, lives with type 1 diabetes.
“When you’re doing activities that are anaerobic, with short bursts of energy, the body is releasing large amounts of adrenaline,” Hanson says. “That signals to your [liver] that it needs to dump large amounts of sugar into your bloodstream. Often then you’ll see spikes in your blood sugar.” This is because anaerobic exercise prompts your liver to produce glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. When your body is being pushed to its limit—not with gentle or moderate exercise, but real heart-pumping, high-intensity stuff—its “fight or flight” reflex kicks in. “Your body doesn’t want you to go low,” Colberg-Ochs says. So instead, it signals your liver to kick out lots of glucose so you have energy.
“Usually, the spikes in blood glucose following high-intensity work come down on their own within a couple hours in non-insulin users,” Colberg-Ochs says. “It can help to follow such activity with a lower-intensity cool down.” Insulin users, she says, should talk to their health care providers about whether or not to take insulin to correct post-exercise highs; if you take too much, you’re likely to come crashing down later.
Safety Note
Talk to your doctor before making any big change in your exercise plan.

Myself included, I have observed a seeming link between improvements in my fitness, progressive increases after weeks or months, but eventually by an infection of some kind, but then it occurred twice in succession then never happened again. That said, let’s examine your hypothesis, for potential causes:
Twenty years ago, when I was working out in my late 20s and early 30s, I would come down with a debilitating period of flu/cold 4 times a winter, and when I moved to working out indoors, and subsequently reduce my workout from 60-90 minutes to <50 that all stopped. Did working out in the cold cause it? Maybe, or did I overtrain, struggling hard to get through the cold air and winter muck?
Exercise itself is unlikely to cause a problem, so more specifically you have:

Overtraining
Reduced immunity from long workouts, i.e., lasting more than ~40 minutes
Room ventilation (lack of, or something growing in your system)
Contact with an infected person of carrier

Am I right in assuming you are taking the metformin to combat insulin resistance? My understanding is that metformin may be helpful in losing weight.
That stuff about changing rapid-acting insulin is the strangest thing I’ve heard in a while. Your insulin may, over time, become less effective. But it should take quite a while and I haven’t heard of it happening THAT often.
As far as losing weight, I would suggest you go to a dietitian and figure out your caloric needs. Ask him/her to suggest a carb count to lose weight and about diet plans. When I say diet plans, I mean what you eat, not a special way to eat that you stop doing once you’ve lost the weight you want. Those are nonsense. Diet plans are ways you eat to live.
If nothing else, talk to the dietitian about what you DO eat to see if there are ways to replace foods that are not as good with something better.
Exercise is all about developing up a habit. Try to find a time to exercise that you can do every day (or at least five days a week). Don’t worry about making your exercise intense at first.

How are you sleeping? I found out a few years ago that I had severe sleep apnea (a birth defect). I just went to see a new sleep doctor because I’m 50 now and need to have a colonoscopy done. She looked at my sleep study and said, “your blood oxygen level was down to 72%. I put patients on oxygen when they are at 90%.” So make sure that the sleep you’re getting is restful. Without my CPAP machine, it was like someone was putting a pillow over my face 45 times in a hour.
One other thing that I would recommend is to have some social interaction. People who you go see a movie with or take a class in something you like to do. Or start playing guitar with a friend. Go to church if that’s what you want to do. Something to get you out of a rut (if you’re in one). Take care of ALL of you.
For example:
I just went to a Type 1 group meeting that was starting up in my area. There were women who had been living with Type 1 for 45, 50, 60+ years. And a few short timers. A young woman diagnosed eight months ago and me (7 years as a Type 1). The most wonderful thing to hear was from the woman who had been dealing with the D for 60+ years. “I’ve never been to a group meeting of Type 1s. I absolutely love it!”
Your best encouragement will come from the people you interact with regularly. We have all had difficulty dealing with Type 1.

Routines need to change after thirteen weeks
Rest periods for large muscle groups are 48 hours, but 24 for smaller ones. Thighs are big, calves are small, lat and chest are big, arms are small

For a change:

Maybe you can do big days, small days instead
You haven’t mentioned your rep range, but if you are using the usual 5 to 10, go heavy (3-5), or light(10-15), for 13 weeks
Try working every set to failure, to momentary muscular fatigue (MMF)
Try a periodicized routine, go heavy for 13 weeks, go bulk for 13, and try fast/light for 13
Use different weight types and/or machines

""Exercise with a Difference"" by Barbara O'Neill (8/10)
At the 34:50 mark of this video (the whole thing is worth your time), she raised the topic of rebounding as a great form of exercise. A rebounder is a mini-trampoline. She explains how this single exercise can provide a way to improve balance, help the lymph system, and increase bone health.
Her coverage of this issue fascinated me. It prompted me to order a rebounder and I just received it yesterday. I think this exercise will help me a lot. As I age (I’m 65 now), I know that maintaining my ability to balance is crucial for safety. Falls are one of the leading causes of degraded health in the elderly.

3046,Trouble building muscle?,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Brian_BSC,3,"@EmilyC, it is great to see you!
I found that the best way to build muscle was through heavy weight training and timing of eating and insulin for recovery.  Cardio (and other aerobic exercise) works against muscle building and while it gives you fitness, you should do things like interval training and not endurance training.
I always liked the “Starting Strength 6” program by Mark Rippetoe.  It is a simple program with just a couple of exercises.  The key is that it focuses you on compound exercises and has you increase the weight in a focused progression.
Next is recovery.  You should have abundant protein in your diet.  Muscle growth is fueled by protein.  If you can’t get adequate sources of meat, fish and dairy then you may need to supplement.  There are many protein drinks out there, I always used 100% whey protein.  After a heavy workout your should have a meal to fuel recovery.  Not a little snack, a meal.  And include carbs.  Heavy weight training will deplete glycogen and your body will readily take up glucose to restore levels.  So plan a bolus and a meal with both carbs and protein an hour after your workout.  And you may find that additional meals in the next 24-48 hours also support recovery.
And do heavy workouts every 2-3 days.  Exercising too frequently works against muscle building. You don’t get muscular and strong when you work out, you get muscular and strong recovering from working out.

3056,Trouble building muscle?,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Buckley83,2,"Hi Emily,
Actually, insulin can be conducive to building muscle, so much so that’s it’s often used by steroid abusers as part of a cycle.
Building muscle is hard work though, you need to run a large calorific excess, I typically have to eat an extra 1,000-2,000 calories a day if I want to gain muscle, which of course can cause issues with BG control.
Exercise wise, I found a 5X5 programme or a “starting strength” programme most useful, simple heavy, low rep caveman exercise like deadlifts, squats. If you have a google on the above terms you’ll be able to download a programme.
You’ll need to ensure you rest and refuel yourself correctly during recovery, doing this if you are low carbing is extra tricky, I could not avoid a hypo five hours later following a squat session unless i’d had 200g of carbs 
Stretching is also very important as if your do these programmes as intended you’ll get a lot of muscle soreness during recovery.
Progressive overload is also key, your body will adapt quickly, so every few weeks the weights must get heavier.
Might be useful to get a personal trainer to guide you through the programme for first couple of weeks, or perhaps find a lifting buddy?
I’ve gone the other way now, keen to be as lean and light as possible the older I get ha!",Jul '17

I second this suggestion! The Olympic-style, compound movement lifts are definitely the way to build whole-body strength and muscle density. I’ve been lifting for the better part of 25 years, and my basic routine is still centered on a 5X5 core (squat, bench-press, overhead-press, barbell row, deadlift) combined with some other exercises like weighted pull ups, dips, and bodyweight/gymnastic drills.

3061,How to prevent lows during exercise with exercise itself,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,MilaStaff,3,"WRITTEN BY: Sheri Colberg 1
Editor’s note: Sheri Colberg, PhD wrote “The Athlete’s Guide to Diabetes 9,” a comprehensive book full of tips + tricks for Type 1 athletes. Below is an excerpt from the guide that details ways to prevent lows, particularly during exercise by actually using exercise as a method to do so. Colberg includes anecdotes from athletes with diabetes from around the world.
Preventing lows during exercise with exercise itself
You may also be able to prevent, treat, or reverse your impending hypoglycemia during exercise by some novel means. All of these involve using the exaggerated release of glucose-raising hormones that you can get by doing an intense, near maximal, or maximal bout of activity. The following options are based on research and athlete experiences:
1. Ten-second maximal sprint
A short maximal sprint may counter a fall in blood glucose levels 1. This has been studied by having exercisers with Type 1 diabetes perform a 10-second cycling sprint either before or after 20 minutes of easy cycling. Done before, sprinting may keep blood glucose levels from falling for the 45 minutes after exercise; done afterward, it may prevent a decline for at least 2 hours. This technique may also help anytime during exercise. Although sprinting will have a limited affect if you have extremely high levels of insulin or a blunted hormonal response, it is still beneficial as a short-term means of raising your glucose levels or preventing them from falling as quickly. As Martin Berkeley of Cardiff, Wales, said, “I always do a 10-second sprint at the end end of a run. This definitely helps prevent hypos by releasing adrenaline. I can clearly see the effect on my continuous glucose monitor.”
*Pro-tip: If you are going low and cannot stop exercising, sprint as hard as you can for 10 to 30 seconds to induce a greater release of glucose-raising hormones. But if you a lot of insulin on board, this strategy will be less effective.
2. Intermittent sprints (or interval training)
You can even keep your blood glucose higher during exercise by interspersing 4-second sprints into an easier workout, which comes closer to replicating what happens when you do sports like soccer or tennis. Doing a 4-second sprint once every 2 minutes during 30 minutes of otherwise moderate cycling has been shown to keep glucose-raising hormones higher, which keeps your blood glucose from declining as much. This effect is the result of both greater glucose release (by the liver) and less glucose uptake during exercise and recovery. Exercisers also experience the same response when they do sprint training and high-intensity interval workouts. Watch out, though, because when the hormonal effects wear off, you may end up more likely to develop hypoglycemia because doing sprints uses up more muscle glycogen.
3. Exercise type + order of training
You may also be able to lower your risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia (or even hyperglycemia) by varying the type or order of training that you are doing during a workout session, such as whether you choose to do aerobic or resistance training first. We know that blood glucose levels tend to fall more during moderate aerobic exercise and less afterward when compared with resistance workouts; this causes less of a decline during the activity and more overnight. If you are already planning to do both activities during the same workout, you can vary the order accordingly.
If you are on the low side with your blood glucose, do your resistance training first, then the aerobic training to keep your glucose higher throughout the first half of your workout. If you are starting out on the high side, begin with easy to moderate aerobic training first to drop your levels and follow that with the resistance work, during which your glucose will stay more stable or rise somewhat (depending on intensity). Fabian Tukacs of Austria has found this works for him, too. He usually goes to the gym and starts his workout with a blood glucose of 100 to 115 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.4 mmol/L). After his weight training, he always does 20 minutes of cardio training; he ends with his blood glucose stable at around 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).",Oct '19

I also studied martial arts and we did these ankle rotations where you sit on the floor and spin your ankle through it's full rom in both directions holding your toes?  This seems to help a bit.

3) Do lots of 50%HR cardio exercise. Don't kill yourself, but make the effort worth the time. Jogging, biking, whatever, an hour a day or so.
4) Consider investing the time and (possibly) money to get a CGM. It is a good tool to have. You may be able to get one for a short time from a Diabetic Trainer or Endo.
5) Talk to a diabetic dietitian.Be aware that being slightly dehydrated could through off your BG meter or CGM.SIDE NOTE: If you aren't really concerned with long term effects on your body or keeping in good health, I've found the most weight loss experienced for me was either during a bad stomach illness or having really high (300mg/dl+) BG for days at a time. Both are horrible for your health and left me feeling weak and depressed. I wouldn't recommend either. From your post, you seem to realize that losing weight in bad ways, is, well, bad.Good luck!

To keep the extra fluid off, I will stay away from soda, sodium and caffeine. I guess I'll just have to cut out the granola bars and absolutely no snacking of any kind. This is going to suck!!

I have lost 2.5 pounds and 1 inch around my main target area my belly. I have gained some muacle in my upper legs and bum which has made some of my clothes tighter but I know it is muscle and my legs need it. I started journaling and discovered I was working out every other day instead of 5 times per week. I also know my weeknesses and where I am not eating as clean as I should. I am trying to work out every day now to get myself in that habit. Run everday and do muscle building exeercises for different parts of the body every day.

3125,Martial Arts,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Stuart,,"All martial arts (by definition) have physical contact between practice partners at some point in their training (ie increasing levels determined by skill/rank). There are hundreds of different arts eg Judo, Karate, Kung-Fu Wu-Shu, Tae Kwan Do, Tai Chi Ch’uan, Aikido, Ba Gwa Cheng, Hwrang Do, Kenjutsu, Hsing-Yi, AikiJujitsu, etc., etc.
Each has a particular technical base, certain “tools” fundamentally which they prefer to use. Some arts strike (punch, kick), some grapple, others “wrestle”, some pin. Heavy physical contact is likely at some juncture it is safe to assume.
My particular question, are PUMPS compatable to arts where heavy physical contact is certain to occur (ie grappling, throwing, “submissions”)?

Welcome to our community. I like your name. It is the same spelling I gave my son. I cannot personally answer your question, but I can tell you what my son has said about using the pump. He is very much into body building, has won some titles, playing football and keeping extremely fit. He will not accept the pump because of the physical activity he does. He says he doesn’t want something taped to him or hanging on him when he is working out. He wants freedom of movement and keeps very tight control of his diabetes with MDI. For him, diabetes is a non issue. He says it is just something that reminds him each day to take extremely good care of his health.
I think each person has to think about what is acceptable to them. The pump is right for some and not for others. I personally choose to keep my MDI’s because I want my grandkids up and down in my arms and on my lap as often as possible. I don’t want anything to get in the way of that or have to be careful because of it and miss holding one of my babies. I wish I could be of more help.

Excellent, another person to chat with : ). Kenpo, Mitose’s ? Lots of flavors of that particular art…Lets dance.
My art is classical/fundamentally Okinawan (ie kata) based. Regardless of the fact we do NOT go full contact often the limited degree of free sparring would get my pump kicked around the room like a blessed shuriken! By my kicking or theirs…
Controlled but with meaningful weight regardless. Line drills, simple partner exercises, application work…
I would clip it to my canvas jacket, my belt, my tee shirt (as an experiment) or on the back of the pants. No place I could put it would not be blasted/tugged/ripped out Like most arts we do have physical contact to varying degrees and intensities depending on the exercise.
I could never make it work and to add insult to injury got dangerous DKA for disconnecting for even an hour. More times wearing it than I had in the entire 30 years previously??? The infusion tubing would get ripped off/tangled during grappling exercises

Regardless of what we call the activity (outsiders looking in go JUDIST what are they doing/doing to each other… ; ) and we are still friends afterwards! At the time I looked like a GSW (gun shot wound) or one of the ancient U. Penn Mummies once the set was in place.Never failed something got snagged, grabbed kicked across the floor, etc., etc. and like it or not I had no place to “hide it” given the uniform. As I said we don’t do full-contact very much, but light-medium certainly, regardless as you well know with control.
But I get tripped/reaped onto my back/side the pump got crushed into my lower back, hip wherever it happened to be placed that class… Disconnection and bolus coverage… sounds awfully dangerous. Sugar drops easily 100 points by itself, heavier training, even more. Was not a huge fan of the “blind coverage”, even if ridicilously light to detour DKA. Too many unknowns with way too many woth serious teeth…
But even doing even the most basic group warming-up “line techniques”, the clip typically popped off and the basics were not being done near speed, or power. Simply quick rote and the thing went flying.
In terms of a “case” of some type what’d you have in mind that would not get shifted to becoming a target in front?? I block better than most but the attacks glanced something, shifted something, pulled something connected to something else and the “little beeper” went rolling all by itself…
I was not able to find a workable answer with mine, hense my question for those who do now. have the accessories improved signifigantly for OUR martial purposes…?
Kata application (aka Bunkai) with a pump.on board is a whole new facet of “SECRET movements”…: D Same same with SD, counter attacks, etc., etc. Throws forget it…

I do not need to get into it with you/anyone over a stupid maneuver for a parking space, or a place in traffic ahead of me. Don’t need to play with others imbalances to maintain my boundries.
I have never believed the height of any art (worth a darn) was to produce violent people. Exploring ones power is necessary to be able to avoid it IMHV. Never examined, carefully play with the “red zone” with ourselves, and definately against another(s) trying to stop us…
Exploring the ~red zone~ is mandatory to be effective against intended harm.
Choosing any art depends almost exclusively on the teacher. Two different people, two different presentations and the identical art in every other way will not be a good fit for you/I respectively.

Throw in being poor and surrounded by kids who ate terribly, I just despaired so much. All we could do was continue to soldier on.

Diabetes is their real life. Not their entire life, but just as much a part of them as a hand or a foot.
They’re curious and dig into how their diabetes works while they read all they can about managing diabetes and learning from their peers who are doing it well.
Successful diabetes managers don’t often enjoy medical professional inspiration and often have a hard time getting collaborative and collegial support from their doctors. I realize there are exceptions to this perspective but I don’t think my experience of 36 years going to quarterly doctor appointment without establishing a truly satisfying doctor/patient relationship is all that atypical.
But you know what? It’s not absolutely necessary. Knowledge, peer support, curiosity, and persistence combined are much more important than kindred-spirit doctor support.

It was shocking, but at the same time not surprising. I became a diabetic decades before the new technology. At home glucose monitors weren’t available until I was 30 and I became a diabetic when I was 8.
I took one shot a day until I was 30. I was more careful about what I ate until I hit the teen years. I remember eating huge banana splits with fries. In my early 20’s I remember eating multiple donuts, and I remember being very thirsty.
I kept this up until my eyes started flashing when I was 30. Once told I had the beginnings of retinopathy, I went to a endo and had my first ever A1c. It was 10. I think many people diagnosed with diabetes don’t let it interfere too much with their lifestyle until their body is affected. If they are very lucky lowering their A1c’s can reverse their diabetic complications.
Once I got below 7 I started healing, once I got to a non diabetic A1c, everything eventually healed and the complications stopped happening.
At 69, and having had type 1 for 61 yrs, I feel very good and have no complications, except for two heart stents. Maybe my years of horrible control caught up with me, I am not sure.
For years now, I have really watched what I eat. I don’t even indulge with birthday cake at my birthday. The only time I eat a forbidden treat is when I am low. I almost never give insulin in order to indulge. I gave up pizza years ago and I no longer eat regular desserts.
I would say that my life is somewhat compromised, but not having a high A1c is extremely important to me. I do miss not being able to go out to dinner, but the food we make is very tasty and extremely healthy. We both enjoy being thin.
I am also very fond of control and of doing medical research, so once I realized I could somewhat control my outcome, I became a very good diabetic.
After the faulty ACCORD study was released, I had two doctors try to convince me to raise my A1c. I refused because a very low A1c has served me very well.
I haven’t had a doctor try to tell me how to control my diabetes in 30 yrs. They only look at my A1c’s.
My present GP is retiring and I need a new doctor. When I interview them, I will tell them about my A1c history, and explain that all I need from them is insulin prescriptions. How can they argue with me?
61 yrs with no complications, except for 10 yr old heart stents and high LDL. Raising my A1c isn’t going to lower my 116 LDL. I can’t imagine having a doctor trying to control my diabetes. That would be ridiculous.

Do you keep basal at 20% during the run or turn it off? If you are at 20% and still going low, you might consider turning it off completely during the run.



 pancreaswanted:

I am running half-marathon distance, so not ultra anything, but long runs are about two hours.


There is a general guideline for runners (I mean all runners, not only those with diabetes) -  for runs over an hour, you should try to consume 30-60 grams of carbs per hour.
For long runs, it’s best to try to follow that guideline, instead of just trying to balance your BG with limited insulin and no carbs.
I try to follow that 30-60 gram guideline, and take a bit of bolus insulin for the carbs if needed. But generally I have zero basal during the run.



 pancreaswanted:

If you do a long workout, what magic do you work so that you are not low all the freaking time?


I go to zero basal right at the start, or a little while before (maybe 15 minutes, maybe 30 minutes, depending on BG). And take some carbs during the run. Also a few carbs right at the start if needed.
For what to eat before, carbs are the best fuel source. A person’s body has plenty of fat for fuel already, so eating it before a run does not provide much benefit. It can slow the carbs down, and that might help. But eating it does not provide an immediate benefit.

What You Should and Shouldn't Eat Before a Run
Eating for endurance can be tricky, but it doesn't have to be






There is a trade-off in fueling, between fat and carbs. By carbs I mean 1) muscle glycogen (which is stored carbs in your muscle), 2) the glucose in your blood, and 3) the carbs you have recently eaten.
You can go farther on fat as a fuel source, but not as fast.
The faster you go, or more intense your workout, the more your body will start to rely on the carb sources.
So depending on your intensity, your body may be relying on mostly fat as a fuel source, mostly carbs, or somewhere in-between.

Objectives  To evaluate the short-term impact of long-distance running on knee joints using MRI.
Methods  82 healthy adults participating in their first marathon underwent 3T (Tesla) MRI of both knees 6 months before and half a month after the marathon: 71 completed both the 4 month-long standardised training programme and the marathon; and 11 dropped-out during training and did not run the marathon. Two senior musculoskeletal radiologists graded the internal knee structures using validated scoring systems. Participants completed Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaires at each visit for self-reporting knee function.
Results  Premarathon and pretraining MRI showed signs of damage, without symptoms, to several knee structures in the majority of the 82 middle-aged volunteers. However, after the marathon, MRI showed a reduction in the radiological score of damage in: subchondral bone marrow oedema in the condyles of the tibia (p=0.011) and femur (p=0.082). MRI did also show an increase in radiological scores to the following structures: cartilage of the lateral patella (p=0.0005); semimembranosus tendon (p=0.016); iliotibial band (p<0.0001) and the prepatellar bursa (p=0.016).
Conclusion  Improvement to damaged subchondral bone of the tibial and femoral condyles was found following the marathon in novice runners, as well as worsening of the patella cartilage although asymptomatic. This is the most robust evidence to link marathon running with knee joint health and provides important information for those seeking to understand the link between long distance running and osteoarthritis of the main weight-bearing areas of the knee.",Feb '20
3176,Fueling and basal reductions for long runs,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Dylan_Sutton,1,"I was talking to a friend’s new partner at a party a few weeks ago who is T1 (age 40, diagnosed late teens) and an ultra-distance runner (e.g. 100km + events). He is MDI, and said he runs with his normal basal and doesn’t even carry short-acting insulin for a 100km run. He fuels up mostly with energy gels, plus bananas etc at checkpoints, and consumes vast quantities of un-covered fast carbs during a run. If you’re running low, I’d suggest maybe you need pure fast carbs (and more of them) rather than buffering the carb with fats and proteins.
I guess the confounding factor is that his “normal” basal doses would take into account a massive training workload of multiple half-marathon distance (short for him!) runs per week.
My 8yo son was diagnosed just over a year ago and while he doesn’t do long runs yet, we do go on overnight hikes. We often find that for harder trails (e.g. 10km trail with 500m vertical ascent) we need to turn his basal right off, plus feed him lollies at regular intervals to keep his BG in range - we haven’t kept track of exactly how much, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it were 30-40g per hour even with a zero basal. If the trail is downhill we leave normal basal running and he tends not to need the straight sugars, but still gets about 20g un-covered carbs per hour in granola bars, rice crackers etc (as well as loads of almonds, pistachios, cashews) without going high. After a strenuous hike he seems to need reduced basals and IC ratio often for a week or more. We had a 3-day hike two weeks ago followed by a weekend mountain biking just gone, and both basal and bolus insulin are down by more than 30% on what he was running in late January.
He started doing ParkRun a month ago (5km) and we’re still working on doing it in-range. The first one we under-dosed 50% for his breakfast beforehand, and he started the run on BG 8mmol/L (140) double arrows up, finished on 12mmol/L  (215) and level. The next time we dosed for more of his breakfast (still under by 20%) and he started on 6.6 single arrow up, topped off at 8 at the 1st km, then fell like a stone and had to walk the next 3km eating jelly beans the whole way. The last run was a bit better,  still under-dosed breakfast by 20% but kept him up around 9-10 for the run with preemptive jelly beans at the start line and regular intervals thereafter, but of course he went high on the way home despite bolusing for some of the carbs as soon as we got to the finish line. A better approach would probably be to have an earlier breakfast so he can start the run with less IOB, but I’m not a morning person so clearing the bolus insulin before a 9am run isn’t going to happen any time soon!",Feb '20

If we walk around all day with elevated fasting numbers and high levels of insulin we will never lose weight. When your fasting numbers are 70-90 mg/dl and you walk around all day with just enough basal insulin you become a fat burning machine. A low carb diet really helps because it dramatically reduces the blood sugar swings after meals enabling to get your blood sugar down, and it also markedly reduces your daily bolus does, thereby reducing insulin.So to sum up my suggestions. Do very focused basal testing to really get your fasting levels normalized. Eat a low (or at least lower) carb diet. And think about increasing those fasting times. Cut all snacks (if you basal is right, you don't need them). And consider intermittent fasting, skipping a meal or two once or twice a week (again if you basal is right your will be fine).",Apr '13

I then cut my lisinopril pills in 1/2 for a month and measured my BP daily or even more often.

I mainly use the water and can find places to refill when I go out for my practice runs. The belt has elastic in it so it does not bounce, and a quick clip-type fastener.

I have a very serious problem and I need the help of my readers to hopefully figure it out or at least get some direction to put me on a path to figuring it out.
I have spoken to several of my doctors, especially my endocrinologist and primary doctor but they are not listening very well and aren’t concerned (and don’t seem to see how very concerned I am), and simply assume my problem is solely due to my lifestyle even though I have stressed that my lifestyle contradicts what is happening here!
My problem is that I am continuing to gain weight (fat) even though I have been working for months upon months to lose weight (fat)!
How is this even possible!?
I exercise and I do not overeat! I eat a healthy, low carb diet with lots of non-starchy veggies, protein, and healthy fats. I do not eat too many calories, either. It’s a great diet for type 1 diabetics and for weight loss! I’m not perfect, but I do very well most the time.
I have a million health issues, and yes some of them make it difficult to lose weight and very easy to gain.  But the extent to which I have gained and continue to gain is extreme and I do not believe it is totally my health issues to blame here.
Type 1 diabetes, mild gastroperisis, mild PCOS, severe insulin resistance, peripheral neuropathy, heart disease, hypothyroidism, blah, blah, blah…
Researching all my medications I am not taking any that cause weight gain except my insulin which I do have to take a large amount of (at the very least 75 units a day but usually much more). But my endocrinologist tells me my insulin is probably not to blame here, at least not to a large extent.
I do take several supplements for several different reasons- deficiencies, immune health, and metabolism health. I am not taking zinc or selenium at the moment but I plan to start because I recently read that they may help with weight-loss because they help to treat hypothyroidism where medication fails (T3 conversion).
Just this year alone I have gained over 20 lbs while exercising and eating healthy (geared toward weight-loss). I have not been able to lose even one pound.
I’m sure you can imagine how heart-wrenching and frustrating this is!
I shouldn’t be anywhere near as big as I am! I shouldn’t look like this!
Why won’t my doctor’s do anything helpful! All they do is say “I can refer you to a dietitian” or “I can prescribe you some diet pills”.
I don’t need a dietitian, I know how to eat right, I am eating right!
I don’t need your stupid pills!  I need to know what’s causing this and fix it! I need a permanent cure for this!
GAHHHH!
I don’t need or want another diagnosis of yet another illness. But since I am so lost and frustrated I looked up “reasons for weight-gain not related to lifestyle” or something to that effect, I don’t remember exactly.  And the answer I got that does match literally all my symptoms is Cushing’s Syndrome (endogenous).  The only problem here is that all the symptoms for Cushing’s can be explained by many of my other illnesses. At this point I don’t think I have it. It wouldn’t hurt to ask my doctor to run tests.
Any suggestions are appreciated.",Oct '17
3217,"Why So Fat, yo?",Healthy Living,Healthy Living,DiabetesOldie,1,"Sorry you’re having to go through all this.  Trying to tease out an answer with multiple conditions like this can be frustrating.  I think even a doctor would find it difficult to diagnose what is going on without doing some further testing.  But here are a couple of thoughts:
You mention 75 (or more) units of insulin. That seems like a lot for a low-carb diet.  How much are you bolusing for a typical meal?  Protein can raise glucose and needs insulin too.  So, two questions: Are you eating rather large amounts of protein and/or have you accounted for all sources of hidden sugar?  “Healthy” fruit juices and smoothies can contain sugar from which the fiber has been stripped away.  That, combined with a high dose of insulin, can promote fat storage in the liver.
I have found three individuals that I think provide excellent insight into diabetes and metabolic issues.
First is Dr. Richard Bernstein, a doctor specializing in diabetes and other metabolic conditions.  He offers a free monthly webinar called “Diabetes University.”  He answers listener questions dealing with weight gain/loss, hypothyroidism, blood glucose control and more.  Regarding thyroid issues, he discusses the role of free T3, free T4 and TSH.  Past webinars are posted on YouTube.  I met Richard almost 50 years ago by telephone conversation.  And then I went out and bought my first blood sugar meter — the kind that was only meant for labs and doctors’ offices!  It was a complete game changer.  So, I suggest you review his past tele-seminars and perhaps submit a question.
Two additional resources are Dr. Robert Lustig and Gary Taubes.  They both point the finger at sugar, including those hidden sugars we may overlook.  Dr. Lustig goes deeply into the mechanisms of insulin action (“the fat storage hormone”)  And both these men talk about the obesity epidemic worldwide.  Again, both men have YouTube videos that may help.
None of these resources are guaranteed to isolate your specific problem.  But I think reviewing their materials can help you ask better questions.  And perhaps that means changing your doctors if they are unable or unwilling to deal with your specific issues.

If you don’t notice those symptoms, you probably don’t have it.  If you do have it, I suspect your endocrinologist would have noticed it by now.
For weight control, the best strategy is to discipline food intake rather than to emphasize exercise, since that is the much more efficient approach.  Figure out what your total caloric intake per day is, what your body mass index is, and determine exactly how much overweight you are.  Then determine a weight reduction diet, say 1200 calories a day, compose your diet of healthy foods and portions amounting to that, and just stick to those foods and portions forever.  If the conservation of mass-energy still holds, you will have to lose weight.",Oct '17
3221,"Why So Fat, yo?",Healthy Living,Healthy Living,JenType 1 or LADA,,"You went through a period of hyperthyroidism not too long ago, didn’t you? When I was diagnosed with Graves’ disease I experienced a 25 pound weight gain after starting treatment, even though I’d changed nothing about my lifestyle. My endocrinologist said that it could have been from the fact that my thyroid was ramped up really high and I adjusted my calorie intake way up (because I was starving) and my exercise level way down (because I was weak, shaky, and tired) without realizing it. Then when I started medication, it slammed my thyroid level back down to normal really quickly, but it took me several months before those symptoms disappeared and I felt well enough that my eating and exercise were back to normal. I’ve also heard many people complain that the medication itself has weight gain as a side effect (although I realize you’re not taking the same thyroid medication as I am).
I also have quite a bit of weight to lose and have found that the only thing that works for me is a very low-carb diet combined with a lot of exercise (several hours of walking a day, or an hour or more of swimming every day, or similar). I think the key is getting a low insulin dose, at least that’s been my experience. When I can get my insulin dose to below 40 units a day I can lose weight, but the only way I can do that is eating low-carb and exercising. One or the other alone, or counting calories alone, accomplishes nothing for me.
Progress for me is extremely slow. I count anything that is not weight gain (such as just holding my weight steady) as a victory in order to stay motivated. It’s taken me two years to lose 20 of the 25 pounds I gained after my Graves’ diagnosis, and I have a lot more than that to lose. I can’t compare myself to others, because everyone seems to have a relatively easy time losing weight and it’s an exercise in frustration. I have never been able to lose one to two pounds per week or whatever the healthy weight loss rate is. I personally feel that women with diabetes and multiple chronic illnesses are in a bit of unique boat. Who knows where the actual cause is. Is it medications? Is it inflammation in general? Is it the fact that two of our most important hormones (insulin and thyroid) are messed up? Is it other hormones that affect our bodies? It doesn’t mean we can’t lose weight, but I do think ti takes an enormous amount of work, and that calories are not the whole answer.
I was tested for Cushing’s disease years ago, and if I recall it’s a 24-hour urine test and maybe some blood tests. I was told that there are very noticeable physical symptoms. I still got tested due to unexplained symptoms I was having (uncontrollable high BP and rapid heart rate, in my case), and thankfully results were negative.
Good luck in working towards weight loss! Let us know if you find anything that works for you. I, for one, would be interested to know as I might find it useful in my own journey.",Oct '17
3222,"Why So Fat, yo?",Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Tamra11,,"Thanks.  I eat, usually, three meals a day, spread out, and try not to snack at all unless I am hypo (which rarely happens because my body insists on high BG despite tons of insulin and a healthy lifestyle). I bolus only for carbs (IC 1:6) which I think may be one problem, I need to consider protein. I try to keep my protein at normal amounts, I certainly don’t gorge on it. One serving of chicken or fish, usually, per meal. I watch my sugars very closely and avoid consuming them at all costs. I do not eat fruit at all, in any form, and do not partake of smoothie type drinks at all.
I am not perfect, no one is, but I do quite well on a day-to-day basis.
I often need correction boluses (ISF 1:12…but I think it needs adjusting now) and this may be due to protein I am not accounting for?
I often wonder if my insulin resistance (it’s getting worse over time despite meds (2K mg Metformin) and diet and exercise) is actually a problem elsewhere? Like maybe with my liver…but my liver labs always come back normal. It’s like my body is losing it’s ability to use insulin at all! Frightening.

3236,5 moves to bring down blood sugars in a pinch,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,MilaStaff,2,"WRITTEN BY: Matt Vande Vegte 3

We’ve all been there.
You’re stuck at work and your blood sugars are a bit high and won’t budge. You’ve given some extra insulin to bring it down, but it doesn’t seem to be working. Before you go and give yourself that “rage bolus” (giving too many insulin corrections out of frustration, only to come barreling down to a low blood sugar later on) I want you to consider an alternative…  Movement .
My name is Matt Vande Vegte and I am a certified personal trainer, nutritionist, diabetic health coach 1, and a Type 1 diabetic. I’ve made it my mission to educate and coach others in the ways of health and happiness using my knowledge and life experiences.
There are a few different strategies to “activate” your insulin on board, but perhaps the best is to get your body moving. Movement increases your heart rate, which increases the circulation of your blood (and insulin), but which types of exercise are best for this? As anyone who has been through one of my heath coaching programs over at FTF Warrior 2 knows, there are many different types of exercise, and they can all affect your blood sugars differently. While heavy resistance training (building muscle) is the best way to boost insulin sensitivity long term, today we are going to talk about a quick and temporary boost in insulin sensitivity in order to get those stubborn high blood sugars down faster. This quick boost comes from steady state cardio, which essentially means keeping your heart rate elevated for an extended period of time. The longer you keep it elevated, the more significant of a drop you will see (typically).
One note: always make sure to properly hydrate before exercising. Hydration is key and goes hand in hand with movement to get that insulin on board working to lower your blood sugar.
The list
I’ve included a few of my favorites down below, but you have to understand how to complete this routine first. There are two routes that you can take:


Pick your favorite exercise and complete 50 repetitions of that movement. Repeat as necessary to bring the shoogs (blood sugars) down.


Complete the entire circuit, AMRAP style ( A s  M any  R epetitions  A s  P ossible), spending 1 minute on each exercise. This means 1 minute x 5 exercises = 5 minutes per circuit. Complete as many circuits as needed to activate that insulin and drop drop drop! (For a full workout, complete 4-5 rounds of this circuit.)


So, in order to put these two magic blood sugar dropping techniques together, here’s the step-by-step, followed by GIF examples to get you on your way to stable and in range numbers!
Step 1. Hydrate
Step 2. Select workout + complete workout
Step 3. Hydrate and celebrate!
Movement 1: Jumping Jacks
The jumping jacks will be serving as your warm-up. They do not create a large demand from any major muscle groups; however, they incorporate a full body movement and will increase your heart rate to assist in facilitating insulin circulation. Another fun fact: jumping jacks can actually improve your mood!

Movement 2: Mountain Climbers
Mountain climbers also incorporate full body movements; however, they require more effort than jumping jacks. As a modification, you may either perform them slower, or perform standing “high knees” to mimic the movement if these are too difficult. Mountain climbers are also an excellent core strengthening movement.

Movement 3: Push Up To Side Plank
Push ups build upper body strength, while the side plank involves using your stabilizers and core strength. Be sure to keep your entire body level and do not let your butt sink down towards the ground. The push up’s involvement of the muscles in the chest, shoulders and triceps will also aid in lowering your blood sugars. As we break down muscle tissue, the muscles take glucose from your bloodstream!

Movement 4: Lunge With Thoracic Twist
Lunges are a great booty builder, but their true power lies within form. I’ve included the thoracic twist for two reasons: it will force you to keep posture in mind, thus keeping your back in a neutral position, and secondly, it will encourage thoracic flexibility as you move side to side in a dynamic stretch. Another large muscle group movement, lunges will activate that insulin and help get you back in range!

Movement 5: Squat Bounce To Squat Jump
Squats are the single best fat burning muscle movement on the planet. But did you know they also drop blood sugars extremely well? For years, I’ve used squats as my go-to when I’m in a tight spot (airplane, restaurant, movie theater bathroom, etc.) and need to get my blood sugars down. Typically, I aim for 30-50 reps, but know that I perform them slowly and controlled. In this exercise, you’ll have the option to include some explosive training into your routine. Do a controlled squat into a small bounce, come back down, and JUMP. Get those blood sugars down, burn some calories in the process, and have fun with it. The only questions is, what will go lower, your blood sugars or your booty?

Bonus Movement: Warrior Walks
Whenever I do have some space and time, I love to go for walks. This never fails to bring my blood sugar down, but also has the added benefit of bringing peace of mind. Take some time to yourself and enjoy the day – go for a walk.
Keep up the Fight,

3238,Reaction to higher dose of age 65+ flu vaccine,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Terry4,,"I went to see my doctor a few days ago and was offered a flu vaccination. I’ve been getting flu shots for many years and feel they are valuable to me. The nurse noted that my recent birthday placed me in the “over age-65” category for which a new and stronger version of the flu shot is recommended.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC):

It has been recognized for many years that people 65 years and older are at greater risk of serious complications from the flu 1 compared with young, healthy adults because human immune defenses become weaker with age. While flu seasons can vary in severity, during most seasons, people 65 years and older bear the greatest burden of severe flu disease. In recent years, for example, it’s estimated that between about 70 percent and 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 years and older and between 54 percent and 70 percent of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people in that age group. So influenza is often quite serious for people 65 and older.

I accepted and received this new-to-me stronger dose. When I awoke the next morning, I felt a headache and stuffy sinuses. I also felt chilled enough while sleeping to retrieve an extra blanket. My symptoms on arising reminded me of alcohol hangovers in my distant past. I felt physically depressed and just wanted to go back to bed. So I did and slept until 5:00 p.m.!
My blood glucose was ranging a bit higher overnight and through my extended “sleep day.” My continuous glucose monitor showed BGs in the 100-160 mg/dL (5.6-8.9) range.
I went to bed early last night and woke up this morning feeling rested and well. I did some internet searching about the nature of the increased dose size intended for people aged 65+. I discovered this info at this CDC web-page 13:

Fluzone High-Dose vaccine contains four times the amount of antigen (the part of the vaccine that prompts the body to make antibody) contained in regular flu shots. The additional antigen is intended to create a stronger immune response (more antibody) in the person getting the vaccine.

I had thought that the increase in strength of the age 65+ flu shot was twice the original version and was surprised to read that it contains four times the antigens of the under-65 formulations.
I still feel that an annual flu shot is a good way to protect yourself, especially if you have diabetes and have passed the age 65 milestone. Have any of my fellow seniors experienced similar reactions to the “stronger” flu shot?",Sep '18

3258,3 diabetes fitness myths you shouldn’t believe,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,MilaStaff,4,"Today, I want to talk to you about some of the biggest myths and misconceptions about diabetes. I am not talking about the misconceptions that non-diabetics often have about diabetes (even though those can be serious as well), but about the diabetes myths about food and fitness that newly diagnosed or even experienced diabetics that I meet believe.
I want to talk about diabetes myths because I hate seeing some of these myths discourage people living with diabetes from exercising, eating well and living full and healthy lives.
Obviously, there are way more than three fitness and diabetes myths, but let’s keep it short and sweet.
Myth #1 – People living with diabetes need to eat “special” diabetes food.
This myth is, in my opinion, both the most serious and the most annoying one since, for some reason, it makes random people think they need to police what I eat (I wrote a fun little post about why you should never comment on what other people eat 4 after another evening being lectured about my food choices at a social event).
The truth is that there is no real difference between what is a healthy diet for a person with diabetes and a healthy diet for a non-diabetic. As long as you adjust your insulin accordingly, you can eat the same food as everyone else.
It’s true that eating a somewhat restrictive diet can sometimes make your diabetes management  easier , but it isn’t necessarily  healthier !
I choose to eat a balanced diet of carbs, fats and protein, which is actually inline with the general health recommendations for non-diabetics. I also choose to eat primarily low glycemic carbs 2 in order to keep my blood sugars from spiking, and because it fits with my fitness goals. I do sometimes go out for a burger, cake or other treat, and I bolus for that. The key, in my opinion, is eating according to your lifestyle and goals and learning how to count carbs.
I have posted an example of my Fit Diabetic Meal Plan 11 where you can see what I typically eat in a day and learn how to calculate your daily calorie need.
Myth #2 – Exercising makes it harder to manage your diabetes
I have actually heard this from a lot of people with diabetes, and have even read it on prominent diabetes blogs! It always makes me sad to see people believing this myth, because the truth is exactly the opposite. Exercise makes it  easier  to manage your diabetes in the long term!
It’s true that when you start working out, it can be hard to find the right balance between food, insulin and exercise, and you may have more blood sugar lows than normal in the beginning, but you can learn to reduce or even eliminate those. When you do, the increased insulin sensitivity from working out will allow you to take less insulin, making your diabetes management a lot easier (my A1C is 6.1 now, something that was unthinkable before I started getting serious about fitness. I also have fewer lows).
While people do react differently to working out, there are some common physiological reactions that apply to most, if not all, people living with diabetes. Most people will see their blood sugar decline during steady state cardio, while it may increase during more intense workouts (like resistance training or CrossFit). So the trick is to determine how, and how much, different types of exercise impact your insulin sensitivity during and after a workout, and then adjust your food and insulin accordingly to avoid low or high blood sugars.
I always keep a journal whenever I start a new meal plan or exercise regime simply to help me figure out my patterns. It can be annoying and take quite a bit of time, but I’d rather invest the time up front than let my diabetes interfere with my life.
You can learn more about how different types of exercise affects the blood sugar (and what to do about it) in my post How to Manage Your blood Sugar When Exercising with Diabetes 7.
Diabetes Myth #3 – If you take insulin you can’t lose weight
So let’s just put an end to this myth one once and for all. Weight management has way more to do with what and how much you eat than how much insulin you take.
If you are in a calorie deficit and bolus correctly for your meals, you will lose weight, assuming you have no other health issues. If you eat more than you need to sustain your weight and bolus for that, then you will gain weight.
What can make it a little more challenging for people with diabetes is that we need to work out the right amount of insulin to take. If you’re constantly chasing your blood sugars, over-bolusing, and then eating to correct (a.k.a. feeding the insulin), you will most likely have a harder time losing weight.
So having diabetes can make it  harder  to lose weight, because we don’t always get our calculations right and have to eat more to compensate, but it definitely doesn’t make it impossible!

3259,3 diabetes fitness myths you shouldn’t believe,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,DiabetesOldie,1,"There may be some nuance here, but I think calling these myths is too strong a statement, particularly myth #3.
First, balancing food and carbs in particular with insulin is far from an exact science.  Even if your body processed insulin in the same way every day (which it doesn’t, ) Dr Richard Bernstein says that food labels are only accurate to +/- 20%.  So if you eat a meal that is high in carbs, your chances of getting a good balance are greatly diminished.
The terms “healthy” or “healthier” need to be defined.  If we include a low HbA1c and a high percentage of time in range as desirable health goals, I believe diabetics need to alter their diets beyond that of non-diabetics to be healthy.  Certainly there is much discussion about how many carbs should be included and that answer will be different for each individual.  But it’s my belief that most healthy diabetics are limiting their carbs to some extent.
“A calorie is NOT a calorie!”  So says Dr Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist and Professor Emeritus at UCSF.  He goes on to explain that the model that says calories in minus calories out equals calories stored is untrue.  The body metabolizes food in different ways.  A low carb, high fat diet or a keto diet do not restrict calories and fat has more calories than carbs.  But many people are able to lose weight on such diets without starving themselves.
Dr Lustig also notes that insulin is the fat storage hormone.  That doesn’t mean you can’t both take insulin AND lose weight, but you can’t take much excess insulin and lose weight.",Jan '19

3267,3 diabetes fitness myths you shouldn’t believe,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Vancouversailor,1,"Labelling all of these issues as myths is an extreme over-simplification and ignores the fact that diabetics are all different and choose different paths to managing their diabetes.
Many people have multiple health issues in addition to diabetes type 1 or 2 and have to balance what they do for one condition with how it might affect another condition. A regular exercise program will benefit most diabetics but what if you are an amputee tied to a wheelchair, or have heart disease and have been warned never to over-exert yourself?
Many diabetics have insurance plans that cover their health needs, or they might be independently wealthy. But many are not, and struggle to buy the most basic items like test strips and find that they need to pick and choose which prescriptions from their doctor to fill, or not, based on the cost.
Some have strong affiliation to a religion that sets rules for what to eat and what not. Some religions require periods of fasting that can wreck havoc with a diabetic’s blood sugars.
Most people developed their eating habits while growing up, influenced by their parents and the community around them. Some habits, as well as likes and dislikes, can be very hard to change or break.
Some diabetics have a strong and very real addiction to food that causes them to overeat and can be very hard to defeat, as the problem is one of underlying psychological issues, a well as the extreme feelings of pleasure they experience whenever they put food in their mouth… They may require professional intervention and are immune to anything they hear suggesting they need to restrict the nightly raids to the fridge.
Thinking you can give some kind of universal advice to all of these people or share particular experiences and think others will have the same experience as you did, is at best wishful thinking.
That said diabetics can gain a lot by sharing information and experiences with others provided they are prepared to take an approach that includes keeping an open mind but also maintain a “user beware” attitude.",May '19

I am highly hesitant of taking advice from an individual that has a vested interest in her advice. Christel may have the best of intentions on the one hand, however, she does have a related book to sell and a website that posting here will give her an SEO (Search Engine Optimization) boost and in a veiled way be an endorsement of her services and her book. I don’t like that without seeing it disclosed upfront.
Myth #1 – People living with diabetes need to eat “special” diabetes food
Her premise is correct however rather than talking about “special” diabetes food the issue is oftentimes not what to eat but what not to eat, or what can be eaten but in extreme moderation. People with diabetes can eat pretty much anything as long as they properly manage their diet and the medication they use to control their blood sugar. Her Myth number 1 points you to her “Fit Diabetic Meal Plan” which to me is an exercise to boost her SEO by getting you to her website and getting involved with her book and services.
Myth #2 – Exercising makes it harder to manage your diabetes
To a certain extent this supposed myth is correct. Exercise tends to make you hungry and that causes you to eat more that then causes you to take more insulin which can be a vicious circle. So exercise and controlling resulting blood glucose is just another one of those pesky routines that has to be properly managed by a diabetic and easier to lose control over for a diabetic due to the extra management aspect which by all means makes it harder to control your diabetes. Note that at the end of the myth number 2 article, she once again posts a link to her website.
Diabetes Myth #3 – If you take insulin you can’t lose weight
There is again some validity to this myth because once again a diabetic needs to manage their weight or it can quickly get out of control due to all the stress, medication(s) and other issues a diabetic has that a non diabetic person does not have to deal with.
In summary, all information we can get about our scourge, and how to handle it better is valid but I wish this forum posted a note on these articles, especially when posted by a staff member,  like in a magazine there has to be a small disclaimer at the top of page that says “advertisement” so that some people don’t get duped into a marketing scheme.",May '19

Exercise is harder for some than others, but I truly think everyone can benefit from exercise. There are lots of programs that exist to allow people with various types of disabilities to participate in exercise and sports. There are programs that allow people with cardiac issues to learn how to safely exercise (I am participating one now, not because I have heart disease but because I have an arrhythmia).

3273,Mental health + the power of running,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,MilaStaff,1,"WRITTEN BY: James Mansfield
May is Mental Health Awareness Month in the United States, and this year I wanted to share some personal accounts from other Type One Runners about the connection between mental health, diabetes, and running.
As likely all of us affected by Type 1 diabetes are anecdotally aware, and as has been explored by the Beyond Type 1 Mental Health series, there is a link between diabetes and depression. In addition to the constant task of self-administering a life-threatening medication (insulin) in order to try to maintain a stable and healthy blood sugar level, we also live with the fundamental awareness that our own bodies are what have caused this misery, as well as the constant need to juggle a balance between quality of life, desirable lab results, and physical, social, and emotional health – factors which don’t always neatly align.
While I don’t have a family history of T1D (every doctor seems to ask this question), I do have a family history of anxiety, depression, and suicide (no doctor seems to ask this one). As we are self-managing a chronic disease through numerous daily choices, our mental health is inextricably tied to our physical health. Not only can Type 1 diabetes exacerbate anxiety and depression, but the reverse is also true. It is all too easy to enter a downward spiral.

IMG_4723-1-e1558045288748-495x660.jpg495×660

For me, after my diagnosis with T1D, I have been fortunate that running has become an activity which links my mind and my body and at the same time heals and enriches both. By running, I am taking an affirmative action to improve my health, beyond preventing or delaying deteriorating health by fighting my body’s insulin deficiency. And instead of focusing on the failure in my body, running also allows me to experience its positivity, strength, and capacity for improvement. It allows me to set my own goals and feel the pride and satisfaction of meeting and exceeding them.
Running takes me to new places and lets me connect with the outside and see the world in a different way. Especially when I am running long distances or on trails, running clears my mind and can feel almost spiritual when I really get into a flow. And while figuring out blood sugar management during running can be a challenge, and even downright frustrating at times, it pays back dividends when I see how much easier it makes BG management throughout the day.
And while I love to run alone, Type One Run 1 has also brought a social aspect to running and T1D which I have found very meaningful. Through TOR, I have found many new friends around the world, both online and in real life. It’s amazing to travel to a new city and run with another person with T1D who may be complete stranger, but who shares the challenge of Type 1 diabetes and the joy of running.

I started running because it was good for my body, but I keep running because it’s good for my mind. Exercise is a wonderful, accessible, cheap, and scientifically-proven method of reducing stress. It’s even been shown to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety! Through the years, the physical and mental act of running has helped me be able to better handle all sorts of personal, professional, and other stressors that have come my way. Physically, I can stand it if I go a few days or even a week without running. But if I skip more than one day, my temper gets shorter, I get more physically anxious, and my threshold for frustration tolerance plummets! Running keeps me on track, pun not intended.
I realized recently that I often experience running the same way that other people describe the process of meditation. I don’t run with music or podcasts, and find that my thoughts just wander as I watch them go by. And when the run gets tough, it’s the mental exercise of choosing to acknowledge the pain but focus on other things instead that keeps me going. Running makes us stronger in so many ways, and teaches us important lessons that can be applied across all areas of life. I wouldn’t be who I am without it!

At first I thought of Type 1 as a burden. With that diagnosis came a wave of stress and anxiety, which at times seemed to shadow even diabetes itself. Soon these three became a combo that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. High blood sugar leads to stress, low blood sugar to anxiety, over-correcting to another high blood sugar, then more stress. Eventually I realized that T1D isn’t a burden at all, because even a burden can be lifted. Sadly though, there’s no one that can lift T1D off of you. It’s your weight to bear. Day in and day out you’ll carry it around, pretending it’s lighter than it truly is. You can’t cure your T1D, but you can escape it, if only for an hour.
As you run, life tends to simplify itself. Things you can’t change in the moment tend to melt away, and you’re boiled down to a more pure version of yourself. As the blood begins to flow so do you, and the weight of stress, anxiety, and depression tends to fade. If only for the next three miles I’m no longer “Jon the Diabetic” but instead “Jon the Trail Blazing Runner.” I promise you that the endorphins of exercise are real and can free us from the weight of our reality, and can drastically change the way you cope with the stress and anxiety of T1D.

APOORVA
I was never into running in school/college, but I had to do something to manage my diabetes. I was in medical school when I was reading new things and experimenting on myself just to master my diabetes! That’s when running came into my life. For a long time, I thought I could never run because during school, I had a dreadful memory of losing consciousness once when I was asked to run. That thought stuck with me and I actually thought running was never meant for me. So I never tried for years and never got the courage to face that fear!
But with insulin shots, running came as a rescue. I began stepping out for short distances and gradually building up to miles and now I can’t believe I actually ran a full marathon last year! Running keeps me sane and mentally tough. I’m a far happier person since I started running. The time when I decided to overcome that fear of running was tough but the moment I was in the zone of my run everything seemed just so right! It gave me so much clarity and every run taught me new ways to balance my own body. I started planning my runs, my hydration and seeing how far I’ve come is inspiring because this wouldn’t have been possible without the amazing people I met on this running journey.
Running helped me gain mental strength, balance my blood sugars and I’ve never felt better – physically, mentally and emotionally. It just gave me my “me time” in the hustle and bustle of daily life! There are times when nothing seems right and I grab my shoes and decide to go run because I know after that run I’ll be more learned and more at peace with myself. Every run irrespective of how short/long it is teaches something and it’s a process – I’m still learning every day!

I used to joke that I ran so much because I was running away from real life. I’m not sure if people could discern, but it was always only a half joke, because for awhile, I really was struggling with real life. And running was my only temporary escape, physically and mentally. But as I continued to run half-marathons, I realized that if I could push myself to take steps forward toward each finish line, I could also pull myself out of the hole I felt I was falling into.
Every time I crossed the finish line was a reminder to myself that I had the strength and endurance to overcome the struggles of real life. And if my blood sugars held up throughout, it made the run that much sweeter.",May '19

3275,Mental health + the power of running,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,CJ114,2,"I would just like to put in a plug here for inline skating.  I tried all the outdoor exercises, Running, cycling, swimming, tennis, etc., but inline skating was the only exercise that I really enjoyed and could stick with decade after decade and gave me great BG control.  Until age 65, I somewhat over did it training 20 miles a day during the week and 50 miles a day on weekends rain or shine for a total 200 miles a week and participated in marathon inline races around the world.
At 65 I gave up the racing scene and tapered back and once I turned 70 scaled back some more to go out for a 25 mile skate on any weekend and/or holiday the weather is at least OK and it is not too cold.
My skating is mostly all on rail trails and over the years, I have seen numerous individuals go from running to cycling when their joints started to hurt and finally to inline skating when cycling took a toll on their body.  In the past few years in the Northeast inline skating is nowhere near as popular as it was in the past few decades and that is really a shame, especially for diabetics.
Inline skating is an activity that can be done pretty much for life, is very easy on the body and does an amazing job at helping control blood sugar.  It is not generally, for whatever reason, a recommended sport for diabetics which is too bad because not only is it great exercise, fun and very helpful in BG control but as we get older balance becomes more of an issue and inline skating done properly is mostly about balance.
Next time you are on a trail and cross a jogger or inline skater, see which has the bigger grin on their face and my bet is it will be the skater.

So unless I had clear and convincing evidence that the time wasted exercising would increase my life by more time than it costs, I wouldn’t do it.  Also, the interruption to other valuable activities exercise costs is another disrupting factor to the organizational structure of the day, so that too should be counted as a cost in the cost-benefit analysis.
Since I can always just adjust the insulin dose to control blood sugar levels the blood sugar reduction from exercise is worthless and disproportionate in time cost to the time occupied by dose adjustment or bolusing.
More consideration should be given to the ‘dis-ease’ of diabetes in terms of the discomfort, dangers, and inconvenience caused by the massive demands on time and energy imposed by its treatment, and insofar as exercise adds to that problem, in my view it just makes the disease worse.",Sep '18

3290,"Diabetes & Exercise Solutions – No Time, Too Expensive, Painful, Boring,",Healthy Living,Healthy Living,CJ114,1,"I gave up exercise routine several month ago, because like any other “plan” or routine it was  not working out long term for me. My go-to exercise was inline skating and when I started 25+ years ago, I would skate ½ mile daily and felt great and it certainly helped stabilize BG readings.  Within a few days, however, my body got used to the ½ mile routine and to get the same effect, had to then increase to .8 miles.  This trend continued until I was up to 20 miles per day M-F and 50 miles on Saturday and Sunday for a total of 200 miles per week.  My motivation beyond stabilizing BG was to compete in inline marathons around the world.
Over time I realized that once the body gets used to a certain heart rate for a certain amount of time, in order to maintain BG stability a continual increase in that exercise is required to maintain the same BG stability.  Bottom line, is that doing the same exercise day after day, even with rest days is a sure road to failure.
For the past several months, I have found that to eat, dose, and exercise to my CGM meter has worked out the best so far this year.  I went on a low carb diet and found that my body will naturally deal with up to 24 carbs per day and will require no medication or exercise at all to stay 100% TIR.  (Previously taking 50+ units of insulin/day).  If I eat 30 carbs, I can dose I:C 1:3 for the difference or I can go for a 20 minute walk  and stay in range.  For 60 days, I went the no insulin route but had to temporarily give that up and do a modicum of insulin in the airplane and inland on a recent trip to Asia.
My next goal is to see what is the maximum number of carbs that I can eat in a day with the most variety of foods and alternate between either an aerobic walk or treadmill.  On the weekend, if the weather is good, will still hit the rail trail for a 25 mile skate.
The ultimate goal is to be able to eat the highest number of carbs per day, without any oral medication or insulin while eating the most variety of foods.

Next year, it might be different. Drink a bunch of Powerade zero. If your farmiliar with NPH, I suppose that you could take 5 units before bed the night before you play, but I would call the Doc and ask.
Strength based exercise often makes people run high. For instance, weight lifting. I get high when I ski aggressively in un-level terrain. You must be using a lot of muscle energy. Your liver must be kicking sugar to help you play. Do you take meds for that?",May '19

3300,T2 looking for advice on how to eat during a frisbee tournament,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,mohe0001,,"I’m guessing that adding an oral med Rx for one day might be tough.
Depends on the numbers. Exercise highs can be tough because they are sticky, even with insulin. But, if its consistently high and not oscillating a lot, then a few units of over the counter NPH on Frisbee days might just do the trick. Its a fast, simple solution if the user is acquainted with insulin already. An early morning shot of 5 units might do it. I dont know.
I sometimes have to dose 12 units of rapid prior to cross county skiing/downhill skiing in the morning. (I do not recommend that he do that…thats just me).
His liver is pumping glucagon/glycogen/sugar. A med might be better for treating that, in general.  But, at the same time, that energy output is what makes you perform well, so I dont know if it helps performance to prevent it. Its possible that its better to treat it with insulin. Its interesting.
I find that my best performance is often accompanied by high BG. Thats my body wanting to work for it and rising to the challenge. That energy output is good. But, if I go too high, then I will feel like crap. I can’t always predict that behavior reliably. So, I tend to treat with short term insulin. Sometimes the interval of oscillation is so short that it becomes a complete crap shoot. However, sometimes I see a very predictable, day after day pattern of it steadily rising (maybe 300 points an hour…which makes basal a better fit UNTIL glycogen is depleted). At some point your body WILL stop outputting sugar. Then, you are at risk of severe and rapid lows. It might take 24 hours to reach that point, or a couple days. Hard to say.
I guess i would recommend actually playing the course a week prior to competition and try a treatment. That might give the best chance of success. A lot depends on ones ability to predict the pattern. If its super predictable, I would treat with a little long term. If things are unpredictable, then you might not have any choice other that treat with a few tiny rapid insulin shots (less preferable).",May '19

What is even more important as we get older is that we start having balance issues.  Inline skating does a great job of helping with overall balance.

Inline skating is sort of like diabetic control and needs to be taken 1 baby step at a time.  Learning to fall without losing a bunch of skin on skates at high speed takes time.  You get pretty good over time at jumping over obstacles including bumps, tree limbs, etc.  You can start on a carpeted surface in your home just walking around on skates until comfortable.  Then go outside on a flat surface and learn to stop.  Then learn to ditch in grass instead of asphalt/concrete when possible.  Every time you conquer a new element inline skating, you get an incredible “high” from your accomplishment.  I think that is part of what makes it so much fun and the time just flies by.
Part of the answer in negotiating bigger and bigger road defects is to graduate to skates with at least 100 mm wheels.  Learning on 78/80 mm wheels, however, is easier.
Just please use helmet, and wrist guards at a minimum.  Additional knee pads, elbow pads etc. are especially helpful at first and keep your body from getting scrapes as you learn.

Hypoglycemia and Cardiovascular Risk: Is There a Major Link?
Hanefeld M, et al.
Severe hypoglycemia is recognized to be one of the strongest predictors of macrovascular events, adverse clinical outcomes, and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, it is uncertain whether a direct pathophysiological link exists or whether hypoglycemia is primarily a marker of vulnerability to these events. Large clinical trials have reported an increased hazard ratio for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe hypoglycemia, but such an association has not been demonstrated in prospective trials of people with type 1 diabetes. Several cardiovascular effects occur during hypoglycemia either as a result of low blood glucose levels per se or through activation of the sympathoadrenal response: hemodynamic changes with an increase in cardiac work load and potential attenuation of myocardial perfusion, electrophysiological changes that may be arrhythmogenic, induction of a prothrombotic state, and release of inflammatory markers. Although the potential for a causal relationship has been demonstrated in mechanistic studies, the evidence from large prospective studies that hypoglycemia is a major causal contributor to cardiovascular events is limited to date. Other preexisting cardiovascular risk factors in addition to hypoglycemia may be the major link to the final cardiovascular event, but a low blood glucose level can trigger these events in patients with a high cardiovascular risk.",Sep '18
3316,The Effects of Low Blood Sugar on Your Body,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Terry4,3,"People who treat diabetes with insulin must live with the tension created between hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. This daily navigation between these two opposing evils brings to mind the Greek mythological sea monsters, Scylla and Charybdis.
Scylla was a rocky shoal on one side of a mariner’s course through a strait. Charybdis, an equally dangerous whirlpool of water, occupied the other side of the strait. This tale of Greek mythology illustrates the human condition of having to choose between two equally dangerous options. This is the myth that gave rise to the expression of finding yourself “between a rock and hard place.”
We must set our diabetes course each day with both Scylla and Charybdis in mind. From the outset of our journey and at almost every clinical opportunity, our medical partners counsel us to steer well away from the danger of hypoglycemia, almost as if saying, “hyperglycemia be damned!” I think this advice causes us much harm.
Even though we live in a time without a cure for diabetes, we now enjoy treatment tools that permit us to often sail a course safely between a rock and hard place. Medical counsel intended to bolster an over-correcting bias against hypoglycemia is poor advice, from my perspective.
With low carb diets, continuous glucose monitors, and the advent of automated dosing systems, we enjoy a much-improved ability to safely steer a path between the twin dangers of diabetes.

Tell me the workout zone structure, as far as when you hit zones 3, 4, and 5. Is zone 5 always at the end? Or is it mixed in during the hour?
What you need to do as far as carbs and insulin depends on when you are hitting the different cardio zones. Spiking from zone 5 is normal and expected, just from your body’s cortisol response. And having your BG drop from the zone 3 workout is also expected.
So the timing of when you are doing the different components should dictate what you do as far as insulin and carb intake.",Dec '18

I usually start on the treadmill portion and hit and stay in zones 3-4 (80-90%) for the majority of this.


There is a bit of variability with what zone will cause a spike. As your fitness improves, you can get into longer periods of higher heart rate zones without a spike. And also it will vary depending on your cumulative fatigue, how long it has been since your last hard workout.
Is that 80-90% of your theoretical age-defined maximum heart rate (220 minus age in years)? Or 80-90% of a threshold pace on the treadmill?
Another way of asking is are they giving you a pace with a heart rate as a target? Or are you using a treadmill pace as a target?
Since there is some variability based on your own fitness, it’s important to find what heart rate zone will spike you, and how long it takes.
For example, if you run at an HR of 150 beats per minute for 1 minute, does that cause a spike? Or would it take longer? Finding that area where your body starts to respond to the exercise stress with cortisol - which will cause a BG spike - is extremely important.
Are you on a pump? If so, it is helpful to turn off basal before the exercise, and apply small carb amounts to cover the BG drops that you might get at the lower zones, and then also to take small boluses right before the higher zones to counteract the spikes.
Ideally, if you can exercise with no IOB (have your meal no closer than about 4 hours before the exercise, or have no meal), that will help reduce the drops. Then cut your basal before starting, and take a small carb treatment at the beginning if needed.
Right before the higher zones begin, check your BG with a fingerstick, because CGM will not be as close during the BG changes when exercising at this level. Take a small bolus before you get to the higher zones.
If you can find out ahead of time what the plan is, that lets you be more pro-active. The surprise workouts are much harder to plan for.
The last thing is the spike at the end, which is most likely a combination of the carbs and cortisol. I would suggest a large bolus right at the end (like 15 minutes before finishing). That lets the insulin start to become active. And then as soon as you finish, have carbs and protein to restore your muscle glycogen and to hep your muscle tissues repair for the next workout.
After every intense workout, have insulin, carbs, protein, and hydration. If your BG spikes after you are done, the carbs can’t be used, so make sure you take sufficient insulin to allow them to be used.
Taking sufficient carbs after you finish will help reduce the middle-of-the-night BG drops that you likely see after these types of workouts.",Dec '18

@Pam21 – When I gained 25 pound over about a five year period, my total daily dose of pump-delivered insulin rose from 40 units/day to 80/units per day. Looking back, it was painfully obvious what had happened.
I developed a personal bias to slightly overdose insulin to prevent highs or diminish their duration. I often found myself taking emergency carbs to head off an imminent low that came crashing down from the stratosphere.
I finally figured out that limiting carbs in my diet allowed me to cut my total daily dose of insulin from 80 units/day down to about 30 units/day while my control was much better with much less variability.

I do have MCT oil and take it occasionally as a source of exogenous ketones. It cannot be cooked with (very low smoke point) and generally is used only concurrently with a keto diet.

3354,Low carb and gaining muscle mass,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,David49,2,"Not sure anyone is still paying attention to this thread, but…I’ve found it challenging. I’m no bodybuilder, but I am an Olympic lifter and amateur athlete (triathlons). What I’ve found is that being diabetic and eating low-carb has made gaining muscle far more difficult than it used to be for me. People above are right: protein helps to build muscle; carbs and fats can provide energy. The problem comes in the latter part of that equation.
In order for anyone to really build muscle you have to stress the muscles pretty well, eat sufficient protein, and get good sleep. While ketogenic diets work very well for some bodybuilders, others have tried and failed miserably. There are two reasons I can think of for this: some people have a difficult time having enough energy to really stress the muscles well on keto or similar; some people can’t derive enough calories from a high fat diet to maintain weight at all.
I have both the first and second problems on keto: I tend to run too-low on glycogen to really push heavy weights; and I can eat 4,500 calories (nominally) on a high-fat diet and lose weight if I’m eating fewer than 50g of net carbs a day. I can get lean and maintain muscle mass (barely) by eating a high-calorie diet with sufficient protein and just enough carbs to restore glycogen. I only seem to be able to build muscle if I’m eating 100-125g of total carbs per day (usually in the 60-90g net range). However, the latter plan compromises my BG control. My solution has been annoying and simple: I’ve given up on building muscle and decided to train for triathlons 
I’m doing my best to maintain my muscle mass (I’m still lifting), but have accepted that glycogen depletion and low-carb eating means my lifts are seriously compromised. Deadlifts and squats, for example, are about 50% of what they were two years ago (a year before my diagnosis). I eat just enough carbs to maintain (shooting for about 80-100g total; 50-60g net carbs per day), and rely on regular glycogen depletion from swimming, cycling, running, and lifting to keep my BG in check (works pretty well except on rest days, where I have to eat truly low carb).

Sorry, that’s a wall of info. Short answer is simple: maybe. Some people can, some people find it difficult. I’m definitively in the latter category, after a lifetime of serious athletic training and an entire year (tomorrow is my “diaversary”) of trying to train on various keto-like or low carb diets. Just doesn’t work for me, but I’ve decided that BG management is far more important than strength or muscles, so I’m settling for becoming a lean, mean running machine.",May '17
3355,Pump vacay for weight loss?,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,DrBBType 1 or LADA,,"On another thread @Dave44 mentioned he did a pump vacay to lose weight, and that has been something I’ve considered myself. I didn’t want to threadjack the other topic, so I’m posting this separately.
I gained 20-30lb over the first year or so of pumping and it seemed not at all coincidental, but I’m not actually sure what the cause is.  Commonest explanation I’ve seen for why it might happen: Cuz now you can eat whatever you want and you over-indulge! But that absolutely did not happen with me. I was doing LC/HF before going on the pump and still am. Going on a pump decreased my TDD (my Lantus dose was much higher than my daily basal on the pump).    I’ve also started getting much more regular exercise than back pre-pump. But the weight has been very hard to take off. I’ve managed to keep it fairly steady since that initial burst of weight gain, but taking it back off seems beyond my grasp. So ok, I’m also older and that plays a role, but still, the question whether pumping rapid-acting all day for basal is somehow more prone to causing weight gain than the equivalent—or even larger—amount of Lantus taken in a single shot.
The idea that going back to MDI for a while might help break through the plateau has popped into my head a number of times. It would be a pain in some ways but I might actually try it if I knew the evidentiary basis for expecting it to work.",Jan '19

3358,Pump vacay for weight loss?,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Terry4,1,"The simple answer is that you’re taking more insulin than you need to for weight reduction. But I’m not in the calories in/calories out camp for weight issues. We are hormone-driven systems and hormones can do all kinds of things to undermine your weight-loss initiatives.
Losing weight when taking insulin is tough. Whenever you treat a hypo, you’re adding unneeded calories and that is maddening.
Low carb, high fat eating styles can vary. Last October I went from eating 50-75 grams of carbs per day to strictly less than 30 grams of carbs with none coming from grains or added sugar. I’ve lost five pounds since that change and more importantly dropped from 34 waist pants to 33.
Have you tried any fasting? It always caught my attention whenever I fasted for medical tests. My blood sugar immediately fell into a healthy range with little volatility. I think our DNA intrinsically knows how to deal with fasting well.
I only eat two meals per day, a late breakfast and an early dinner. I can easily do a 24 hour fast by skipping either of these two meals. I feel like the fasting period resets my metabolism, decreases my appetite, and often leads to losing a small amount of weight-loss. If I do this missed meal fasting more regularly, like twice per week, I can dependably lose weight.
All that being said, my weight loss program is still a work in progress. My weight loss has plateaued at the five-pound level and resists falling further. I want to lose 8 more pounds to get to what I think is an ideal weight for me, a lower weight than almost all of my adult life.
I don’t believe that you can exercise your way to weight-loss. At least for me, exercise stimulates appetite and it’s easy to rationalize giving yourself a food treat to reward you for the exercise effort. I’m not negative about exercise, in general. I believe it is essential to good health, especially when managing blood glucose in manual mode.
One thing I would concentrate on is getting enough sleep. Losing sleep causes people to consume more calories the next day.
Losing weight while taking insulin is a complicated dance. But it can be done. I think that personal experimentation is fundamental to success.
I don’t think that pump-delivered insulin is more prone to weight gain than MDI. It’s important to monitor your total daily dose (TDD) of insulin over time. When I went through a period when I gained about 20 pounds over several years, my TDD doubled. It was so gradual that I didn’t recognize it as a warning about weight gain.
Good luck with your efforts. I think it is totally worth it. This last five pounds of weight loss has felt very good to me. It’s nice cinching the belt to new territory.",Jan '19

3362,Pump vacay for weight loss?,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Terry4,,"If memory serves me, pro-inulin, the precursor of insulin, contains three chains of amino acids, A, B, & C. When the C-peptide chain is removed from the A & B chains, insulin remains. That is why the C-peptide blood test reveals the amount of naturally produced insulin. There’s a one to one correspondence between the amount of C-peptides and insulin generated naturally.
Since the C-peptide chain is not needed to metabolize glucose, the manufacturers apparently don’t think it needs to be in our injected insulin formulations. I suspect that the C-peptide chain in a gluco-normal performs yet-to-be-identified benefits.
@DrBB, I also know that lean muscle tissue leads to a higher basic metabolic rate than less lean or fatty tissue. Doing some strength resistance training regularly can produce immediate benefits in raising the basic metabolic rate.
I really like the positions Dr. Robert Lustig takes in the article @Jim26 linked to above. His take on eating lower carb is consistent with my experience.

3379,AACE statement questions efficacy of dietary supplements for bone health,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,MilaStaff,,"A healthy diet that includes adequate consumption of calcium, vitamin D and protein is more effective for bone health maintenance than vitamin and other supplements, according to a position statement released by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.
“Given the study limitations limiting our current knowledge, provision of excess nutrients beyond their threshold of benefit may not produce a greater response,”  Daniel L. Hurley, MD, FACE , associate professor of medicine in the division of endocrinology, diabetes, metabolism and nutrition at Mayo Clinic and president of AACE, and colleagues wrote in the statement. “Three critical nutrients for bone health are calcium, vitamin D and protein, and diets that are inadequate in one may well be inadequate in other nutrients important to skeletal health. Otherwise, optimal nutritional status for bone health is best obtained by consuming a healthful diet and will likely not be met by single nutrient supplementation.”
Calcium is best obtained from food sources, as low-calcium diets can increase the risk for osteoporosis and fractures at all ages. However, the authors recommend total calcium intake of no more than 1,200 mg to 1,500 mg per day. Use of calcium supplements should be weighed against regular calcium consumption from food and only to reach the recommended threshold.
Other minerals such as phosphorous/phosphate, magnesium and fluoride have varying degrees of importance in bone health, according to the authors.
Although failing to get enough phosphate can negatively affect bone mineralization, the mineral is present in many foods and insufficiency is unlikely, they wrote. Additionally, excessive phosphate consumption can harm bone health, especially if calcium intake is low or renal function is compromised.
Magnesium consumption, which aids in calcium and potassium homeostasis, is lower than recommended in nearly half of the U.S. population, but evidence is lacking for the benefits of supplementation, according to the authors. Additionally, fluoride is found throughout the food chain and is therefore not a clear candidate for supplementation.
Boron is a still misunderstood mineral when it comes to bone health, although it has positive effects on vitamin D, estrogen and renal retention of calcium, according to the authors. Although boron supplementation is not recommended, its presence in foods like fruits, leafy vegetables and nuts makes it an accessible mineral and one that may have ancillary benefits for bone health.
Vitamin D is another important factor in bone health, according to the authors, but controversy surrounding the definition of vitamin D insufficiency and high vitamin D distorts how effective supplementation may be. Even if vitamin D is mostly obtained through exposure to ultraviolet B radiation and not food, the authors do not recommend “huge single doses of vitamin D” and advise individual consideration for addressing low or high vitamin D levels.
Along with vitamin D, vitamins A, K, E and C all have varying degrees of effect on bone health, but the authors do not recommend supplementation, especially as some are naturally occurring in a normal diet.
Protein has a beneficial interaction with calcium in bone health and can help decrease fracture risk. The authors, therefore, emphasize the importance of “adequate protein intake” as a necessary protective measure in bone health.
In a similar vein, they addressed trace elements, which are part of the growth, development and maintenance of bone and other body tissues. Despite this important role, trace elements in over-the-counter supplements have not been studied enough long term to recommend their use in improving bone health and reducing fracture risk.
One strategy the authors recommend for the consumption of a balanced diet for optimal bone health is food fortification, which can provide bone health-positive nutrients to more people without changing consumption behavior. In the meantime, there is more work to be done in determining the optimal approach to bone health, especially since requirements vary from person to person, they wrote.
“As clinicians, we are frequently asked for advice regarding proper nutrient intake to maintain health,” Hurley said in a press statement. “However, there are varying factors to consider when defining nutritional adequacy for optimal bone health, such as food consumption and interactions between nutrients and food, and therefore, additional studies are needed to provide more clarity.” –  by Phil Neuffer",Nov '18

Cant help you specific to the Jujitsu, Brazillian or otherwise. My practice has an Okinawan heritage. That said, having been a martial artist, (one art) for more than a day or two I have a couple ideas…
Most likely spikes are likely caused by massive adrenaline whether specific to sparring or caused by the activities leading up to it. One likely factor.
Another could certainly be whatever you ate before class, but unless its carb heavy I cant imagine anyone doing that before any martial arts class, it be a baaaaad idea more than once or twice. Can’t imagine that being a serious factor, but whatever you eat/ate before class could be a piece certainly.
Where do/did you inject when you get the spikes? Does it always happen, or just certain days, certain practices/activities (e.g. king of the hill). Could be a connection between where you put the injection and the activity you are focusing on that class(es). Not likely a huge factor but might be a piece. IF you’re doing a lot of bag work and you injected into your arm recently… it can get absorbed faster and could easily produce a spike by doing so.
How about your short acting insulin (or long acting), any chance its dropped off, you have little/none on board when the middle of class occurs? Thats a likely suspect I would think.
How bout, because your practice IS so much heavy physical activity, pinning, submissions, body to body could the highs your experiencing be a bounce, a rebound caused by a real “low level” low, and the high was your body’s adrenaline response caused by that?
What kind of spike are we talking about? Fifty, a hundred, several hundred points… does it come back down after class, presumedly once you use a couple units to get there?

My style is Iwama or Takemasu.  Apparently calling it Iwama style is not correct these days.  Following Saito Sensei, in the last years of O’Sensei’s teaching at Iwama. It’s very very technical, down to the angle of the toes, degrees of knee bend.  Less flowing and more applied than some styles perhaps.  And a very structured pedagogy, which I really like.

There is just so much detail involved.  I am needing to work harder on completing my techniques, as I have an advantage in being 5’0”, and most partners fall in a heap before I’m even close to finishing the technique.
I have never worn my pump in taijutsu, ever.  I learned the hard way when doing gymnastics that pumps do not stay put, and hurt to land on.

This is helpful, but another thing that can help is a few carbs right when you start.
Your body has 3 general fuel sources for long runs - muscle glycogen (stored carbs in your muscles), fat metabolism, and from glucose in your blood and from recently consumed food.
It will use a combination of all of them, but it uses the easiest source. Early on in a run, your body is warming up and it will often take a lot of glucose from your blood because it is easy. So this can cause a drop in the first few miles.

Do you cut your basal down too? Or just cut the bolus for the food you eat prior?
For long runs (like over an hour) I turn basal off completely. Sometimes 30 minutes before starting, sometimes right before starting.
For anything less than an hour, it just depends.
Here are some links with some write-ups I did. Not all of it is diabetes related, but it gives good general background info on what is happening with your body.
If you want to read a bit and then we can get into some specifics for you. Such as how hard you are running, if you are doing a gradual slow warmup or just starting right off at your pace, about cutting basal, your general carb consumption, how frequently you are running, things like that.

Did you also turn off your basal? If not, it would probably be good to add that into the mix.
Another thing to consider - your body will use whatever fuel source it can and whatever is able to supply what your body’s needs.
For slower paces, it can use fat metabolism. The faster you go, the more your body will rely on carb metabolism, which is muscle glycogen and the glucose you have available in your blood at the time (since your liver does receive the signal that your blood sugar is low, so you do not get the liver glycogen like the non-D’s).
What pace are you running, in terms of your easy, medium, or hard? Is it a very easy pace? Somewhat challenging?
I think it helps to have a bit of a slow warm-up, to allow your body to begin mobilizing fat metabolism. Once you get warmed-up, your body can use the multiple sources it has, and you may not burn as much of your blood sugar.",Oct '18

I do have diabetes and things consistently go wrong. The important thing is that using data, I get back on track within a week or two instead of troubling patterns going on for months or more.
I know not everyone is motivated by numbers; I’m lucky, with having diabetes, that numbers and data make me want to do what needs to get done. I find that the mere observation of my diabetes data hooks me on a subconscious level and without even thinking much about it, it gives me the motivation to take the action that I need. It makes, for example, stopping a recently developed evening snacking habit easier for me.
Adam Brown mentions the ambulatory glucose profile (Dexcom Clarity and other software) in this piece. I’ve been using it for years. I think the 14-day AGP is the best, most concise, report that provides the basis for taking action. It is a single page report and most of the value lies in its simple graphic, once you learn how to read it.
If you don’t like numbers and data and can only muster up a limited amount of effort to absorb it, I would concentrate your effort into understanding this one basic report.

3437,New NIH reference book is one-stop resource for diabetes medical information,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,MilaStaff,,"Diabetes affects a body from head to toe. Now there’s a resource that illustrates its effect on both – and all the parts in between.
Thanks to research, what we know about diabetes and how to treat it has grown vastly over time. Now, researchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health  – along with leading diabetes experts from around the country and world  – have developed the third edition of a reference designed to be a one-stop source for crucial scientific information on diabetes and its complications: “Diabetes in America.
The resource is designed to be useful to a variety of audiences. Through “Diabetes in America,” patients can better understand their condition, and practitioners can determine the likelihood that their patients will develop diabetes or associated complications. Health policy makers can use the resource to help guide decision-making, while scientists can use the resource to identify areas of needed research to advance care for people with or at risk for diabetes.
“′Diabetes in America′ was written to serve as the go-to book for anything you ever wanted to know about diabetes,” said Catherine Cowie, Ph.D., editor of “Diabetes in America” and senior advisor for the NIDDK Diabetes Epidemiology Program. “It’s a resource for everyone, because diabetes affects just about everyone, from the more than 110 million Americans with or at risk for the disease to the many more people who care for them.”
Covering the spectrum of diabetes, the book describes data and trends in the United States, complications of diabetes and related conditions, and prevention and medical care, including outlining major diabetes research findings. The effects of age, race, ethnicity, and other factors are also examined, helping practitioners develop individualized treatment plans and patients understand their unique risks and protections.

Catherine Cowie, Ph.D., editor of “Diabetes in America” and senior advisor for the NIDDK Diabetes Epidemiology Program, describes how diabetes affects the body from head to toe – including in ways that may surprise people.
The book reports on well-known complications of diabetes, such as heart, eye, kidney and nerve diseases, and also shows the connection between diabetes and other serious conditions, including cancer, dementia, bone fractures, and urinary incontinence.
“Diabetes doubles the risk of many devastating conditions in the body, from hearing loss to heart disease to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. With this third edition of ‘Diabetes in America,’ we hope to shine a light on the many consequences of this costly and chronic disease, and how research continues to improve the outlook for people with or at risk for diabetes or its complications,” said NIDDK Director Griffin P. Rodgers, M.D. “Written by leading experts, this guide provides everyone with crucial information about the toll of diabetes on Americans and gives scientists a resource to identify necessary research to improve health for all people with diabetes.”
“Diabetes in America ”  also presents points of hope found through research:


Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed.  The NIDDK-funded Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) found that people who are at high risk for type 2 diabetes can prevent or delay the disease by losing a modest amount of weight. A DPP-based intervention has since been disseminated nationwide.

People with type 1 diabetes are living longer, healthier lives.  Findings from landmark NIDDK-funded research has made early and intensive blood glucose control the standard treatment worldwide for type 1 diabetes, contributing to longer life expectancies.

Rates of some complications are declining.  Improvements in management of diabetes have led to a decline in the frequency of some complications of diabetes.  For example, the number of adults with diabetes requiring lower extremity amputations has decreased.

“′Diabetes in America′ shows that though much progress has been made in understanding and managing diabetes, and in preventing type 2 diabetes, we are still on a long journey to good health for all,” Cowie said. “We hope this edition, the first in more than 20 years, will help educate people so we can lessen this burden for everyone.”",Oct '18

3440,Eating crickets may improve gut health,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,MilaStaff,1,"Has anyone ever eaten insects?
I remember during a school trip visiting a place that sells insects, candied, spicy, crunchy; you name it. Some friends tried them, and I could not stand the idea of eating a cricket. I know that @Mariana11 has mentioned that in Mexico they some insects too. I think I’ll keep my kefir and probiotics, but curious if we have any adventurous members here.
Research suggests that eating crickets may improve inflammation in the gut and its overall health, according to a study in Scientific Reports. The investigators looked at whether cricket consumption was tolerable and safe and changed markers of inflammation or lipid metabolism, and they assessed whether insect fibers such as chitin – the chief component of a cricket’s exoskeleton – could work as prebiotics.

It should be an incredible trip and we are really looking forward it.  However, this will be my first time doing something like this with diabetes, so I wanted to see if anyone out there has any experience or advice on how to manage diabetes on multi-day outdoor trips.
I was diagnosed with Type 1/LADA in Feb 2016.  Prior to that I wouldn’t have thought twice about a trip like this.  I’ve done Everest Base Camp, Kilimanjaro, multi-week river trips, etc, but all before I was diabetic.  Like a lot of people out there I try not to let diabetes control my life and impact what I do.  But I’m still nervous about the trip and how I will control my blood sugar.
Obviously my main concern is getting too low when I’m out in the wilderness.  Should I decrease my basal dosage?  Decrease the amount I bolus with meals?  Snack more often while we’re walking?  Do all three things?  What do you do to stay healthy while you’re in the outdoors?
Also, any advice on handy gadgets for carrying insulin pens while on an extended trek is always welcome.  I have a Frio, but don’t love it and would upgrade it there were something better.
Thanks for the help!

3447,Multi-Day Trekking with Diabetes,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,Willow4,,"A Frio is the best thing to use for keeping your insulin cool. If you are going soon, it is spring in Tasmania and there won’t be excessive heat to concern you. Besides, Tasmania does not usually have excessive temperatures.
As to how to manage your diabetes on your trek, I find that even a one-mile walk will bring my BG down dramatically. I would suggest you make a few trial walks and test a lot to see what happens as we are all different.
If you are on a pump and CGM, then you can dial down your basal and watch what happens on the CGM. If no pump or CGM, then test a lot to keep on top of things.
And, yes, carry enough carbs with you to address the lows. I like Skittles because they come in 1g bits and are easy to count. There are others. Also carry some protein/fat to extend the duration of the carb digestion such as cheese sticks, which work well for me.

3449,Multi-Day Trekking with Diabetes,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,katers87,,"Have you had a chance to do some hiking since your diagnosis?
I find that muscle workouts tend to spike my blood glucose levels whereas a walk or run causes me to drop. A strenuous hike with an incline falls into the former category for me, so I’m actually more likely to run high than low on difficult hikes.
I don’t know the terrain in Tasmania, but it might be helpful to do some research on the treks you’ll be doing and try similar elevation hikes before going. That could help you gauge what direction your blood sugar levels will go while hiking.
I find that liquid (e.g. gatorade) or glucose gels tend to digest faster on hiking trails. I bring sweets (e.g. skittles) with me on hikes in case I drop low, but when I use them to treat a low, they take much longer than gatorade.
I’d look into getting some of those glucose gel packets. I think they’re gross, but they kick in fast.",Sep '18
3450,Multi-Day Trekking with Diabetes,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,John58Type 1 or LADA,,"I’ve done several 1 to 2 week hut-to-hut mountain treks after my 2014 diagnosis. Glucose tabs and raisins were always in my pocket for raising BG and were used often, as well as other miscellaneous fruit and glucose gel. Other than that, a CGM and drinking plenty of water are essential. The Frio worked great for me. If you use a Dexcom, a hard case for spare sensors is important. The plastic tabs will get knocked off if the sensors are stuffed into a backpack without protection.
My main difficulty on those trips was the only food available for dinner was usually pretty high in carbs. I was usually pretty well starved by dinner time so portion control was tough, and I struggled with night time highs. I was using Humalog at the time and late night corrections were a PITA because they took so long. I suspect that faster bolus insulin such as Fiasp would have been more effective. Only other insulin related issue I had was when I fiddled with my basal dose during a trek which was not a success. I was on Lantus at the time and was not able to fine tune to an optimal basal dose. I subsequently changed to Tresiba and recently took a 2 week bike trek with no basal issues at all.",Sep '18
3451,Multi-Day Trekking with Diabetes,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,David49,,"Not sure how strenuous your trekking will be, but it can be useful to think about how many calories are burned per hour and replenishing glycogen (unless you’re experienced and seriously “fat-adapted” from endurance training while eating keto for months on end). In traditional mountaineering (i.e., trekking mile on mile with 60+ pounds in a pack, plus gear, at altitude, and summiting involving moderate climbs), the rule of thumb is that an average climber (150lbs with 15% body fat) burns a bit more than 200 calories per hour.
In order to keep muscle glycogen stores filled, it is general practice to target eating 200 calories worth of carbs (about 50g of carbs) per hour, every hour while trekking, and again within the first hour after ceasing activity. Clif bars (and similar products) were designed to this end.
Obviously, the calculus is a bit different for us, but even though I eat low-carb in day-to-day life, I’ve found that if I do any kind of serious endurance training/work with duration more than an hour (cycling, trekking, climbing, etc.), I do need about 50g of carbs per hour of work to keep performing and keep my BG from plummeting.

Thanks for sharing your experience.  I also suspect that most of our meals will be carb heavy; pasta, rice, bread.  But I’ll deal with that issue just like I’d deal with it in a normal situation.  Actually, running a little high might help put my mind at ease while we’re trekking.  Regardless, I’m glad to hear that you were able to do the trip with no serious issues.

Thanks for the great advice.  I was planning on stocking up on Cliff Bars anyways.  They are pretty high in sugar and are one of my go-to snacks when I’m out hiking.  I know they’ll raise my BG without fail.
I’ve found that hiking and running don’t seem to affect my BG as much as biking does, probably because it’s a more intense workout.  I’m hoping to go on some longer hikes over the next few weekends so I can test out some theories and see how my BG response over a strenuous 4-hour hike.  The problem is that I live in Hong Kong and it’s crazy uncomfortable outside these days.  Maybe by October it will be more comfortable.  Anyways, thanks again for the info.",Sep '18

Some have just bread and cheese, a few crackers etc. others have hot food. It might be wise to carry some breakfast and mid morning snack foods with you unless you know the huts will be able to supply a decent meal. I forgot about the Clif bars…I travel and hike with a multi-day stockpile of bars for that purpose but there are limits to how many you will want to carry.

Eat a fruit or something with 15-20 gr carbs before you start.
Then add carbs every thirty minutes:
0,3-0,9 g/kg (to me I´ve found 20 gr to work). And I prefer to use liquids. not bars.
When on a hike and you would like to use something other than bars, I would recommend finding a liquid gel with a cap.

A simple promise… for MY HEART, for YOUR HEART, for ALL OUR HEARTS.
Cardiovascular disease is the world’s number one killer today.  But it doesn’t need to be this way. By making just a few small changes to our lives, we can reduce our risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as improving our quality of life and setting a good example for the next generation. It’s about saying to yourself, the people you care about and individuals all around the world, “what can I do right now to look after MY HEART… and YOUR HEART?”
Heart health is at the heart of all health
When you look after your heart it means eating and drinking well, exercising, stopping smoking… all the things that make you not only healthier, but also feel good and able to enjoy your life to the fullest.
CVD is the leading cause of death and disability in the world, killing 17.5 million people a year. That’s a third of all deaths on the planet and half of all non-communicable-disease-related deaths. Around 80% of these deaths are in low- and middle-income countries where human and financial resources are least able to address the CVD burden.
World Heart Day plays a crucial role in changing all of this. It is a vital global platform that we, as well as our members and supporters, can use to raise awareness and encourage individuals, families, communities and governments to take action now. Together we have the power to reduce the burden of, and premature deaths from, CVD, helping people everywhere to live longer, better, heart-healthy lives.

The evidence suggests that our bodies may do best when we eat more in the morning than at night, a pattern that’s vastly different from how most Americans eat. Timing our meals this way may lead to better body weight, hormone regulation, blood sugar and cholesterol levels, sleep patterns and other metabolic improvements.

I haven’t done a mudder, but in any long race I always turn my basal off, so you might consider going without the basal. Even if the pod falls off, it doesn’t matter, when the race is over put on a new one.
Just tape up your dex and it will be fine.

First, I think you should takes test strips and a meter.  Buy a Walmart or CVS brand
if you do not want to use  the expensive Dexcom.  Check how the meter calibrates with Dexcom and see if it reads differently over time like when you  r at yr lowest  or highest and just regular just be able to have some idea how they work differently.  One assumes that sugar may go low but  with the anxiety and stress of the race  it may go high.   I have read about this and it happened to me Everyone is different.  I  took hammer gels with me.

Based on how long you will need to complete the race talk with doc about treatment options.

3499,Diabetes care: 10 ways to avoid complications,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,MilaStaff,5,"Here are 10 ways to take an active role in diabetes care and enjoy a healthier future.
1. Commit to managing your diabetes
Learn all you can learn about diabetes.
Your diabetes care team can help you learn the basics of diabetes care and offer support along the way, but you are the player, you make the calls.
2. Don’t smoke
Smoking increases your risk of type 2 diabetes and the risk of various diabetes complications, including:

Reduced blood flow in the legs and feet, which can lead to infections, ulcers and possible removal of a body part by surgery (amputation)
Heart disease
Stroke
Eye disease, which can lead to blindness
Nerve damage
Kidney disease
Premature death

3. Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control
High blood pressure can damage your blood vessels. High cholesterol is a concern, too, since the damage is often worse and more rapid when you have diabetes. When these conditions team up, they can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other life-threatening diseases.
4. Schedule regular physicals and eye exams
Schedule two to four diabetes checkups a year, in addition to your yearly physical and routine eye exams. Your eye care specialist will check for signs of retinal damage, cataracts, and glaucoma.
5. Keep your vaccines up to date
Ask your doctor about:
Flu vaccine. A yearly flu vaccine can help you stay healthy during flu season as well as prevent severe complications from the flu.
Pneumonia vaccine. Sometimes the pneumonia vaccine requires only one shot. If you have diabetes complications or you’re age 65 or older, you may need a booster shot.
Hepatitis B vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for adults with diabetes who haven’t previously received the vaccine and are younger than 60. If you’re age 60 or older and have never received the hepatitis B vaccine, talk to your doctor about whether it’s right for you.
Other vaccines. Stay up to date with your tetanus shot (usually given every 10 years). Your doctor may recommend other vaccines as well.
6. Take care of your teeth
Diabetes may leave you prone to gum infections. Brush your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, floss your teeth once a day and schedule dental exams at least twice a year.
7. Pay attention to your feet
High blood sugar can reduce blood flow and damage the nerves in your feet. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can lead to severe infections. Diabetes can lead to pain, tingling or loss of sensation in your feet.
To prevent foot problems:

Wash your feet daily in lukewarm water. Avoid soaking your feet, as this can lead to dry skin.
Dry your feet gently, especially between the toes.
Moisturize your feet and ankles with lotion or petroleum jelly. Do not put oils or creams between your toes — the extra moisture can lead to infection.
Check your feet daily for calluses, blisters, sores, redness or swelling.
Consult your doctor if you have a sore or other foot problem that doesn’t start to heal within a few days. If you have a foot ulcer — an open sore — see your doctor right away.
Don’t go barefoot, indoors or outdoors.

8. Consider a daily aspirin
If you have diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking or high blood pressure, your doctor may recommend taking a low dose of aspirin every day to help reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke. Ask your doctor whether daily aspirin therapy is appropriate for you, including which strength of aspirin would be best.
9. If you drink alcohol, do so responsibly
Alcohol can cause high or low blood sugar, depending on how much you drink and whether you eat at the same time. If you choose to drink, do so only in moderation, which means no more than one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than 65 and two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.
Always drink with a meal or snack, and remember to include the calories from any alcohol you drink in your daily calorie count. Also, be aware that drinking can lead to low blood sugar later, especially for people who use insulin.
10. Take stress seriously
If you’re stressed, it’s easy to neglect your usual diabetes care routine. To manage your stress, set limits. Prioritize your tasks. Learn relaxation techniques.
Get plenty of sleep. And above all, stay positive. Diabetes care is within your control. If you’re willing to do your part, diabetes won’t stand in the way of an active, healthy life.",May '18

I’d like to hear more from type 1high-carb diet eaters about your trials and tribulations and how you manage to maintain good control.",Jun '18
3509,Diabetes care: 10 ways to avoid complications,Healthy Living,Healthy Living,YogaO,,"I run what appears to be a relatively high carb diet and like you, I’m pretty active, so carbs make it easier for me to manage the low side of the D-wave. I know there are some who are also very active and are fairly low carb, but I haven’t been able or willing to make that work for me.
Managing it all? The biggest plus for me has been a combo of having a CGM and a pump.
When I combine the trending info, my experience with the effects of activity, and the ability to run temporary basal rates, extended boluses, square wave, etc, I have been able to limit my hyper excursions pretty well.
My biggest problem? Hypo excursions, I am having too many! However, I do think that my Dex overreports and I know I get compression lows at night (aka, false lows), so I’m thinking I still have some minor tweaking to do to bring them up to more acceptable levels.
Specific tactics include situational pre-bolusing.
For example, this morning I woke to 79 mg/dl (4.4 mmol). When I bolused 1.6U for a banana w/34g carb, I only waited 5 minutes before eating. If I were between 81 - 95 mg/dl (4.5 - 5.3 mmol), I would have waited 10 - 15 minutes. If I were @ 120 (6.6), I would have waited 20 - 25 minutes.  I also use my Dex for the start of a downward trend. I fully expect to peak as high as 175 mg/dl (9.7 mmol), but I also expect that I will end up under 100 (5.5). However, since bananas are notorious for having widely variable carbs depending on ripeness, I am ready to bolus a bit more as I watch my trending data.

The prioritization of various so called essential workers is still up in the air, and lobbyists are pushing for their clients in every state capital.

For example Pennsylvania puts Type 2’s in Phase 1c, and older Type 1’s in Phase 2, see here: https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Programs/Immunizations/Vaccine%20Plan%20V.3%20FINAL.pdf 5

It really depends on how “cloudy” his cataracts are.  Surgery removes that cloudiness.  Glasses only help to some extent, to help with focus.  The halos will likely stay the same with glasses, where surgery would improve them.
I have had  cataract surgery in both eyes.  I chose to get regular/clear lenses.  New options (more cost) can implant “corrective” lens (IOL) during the cataract surgery.

Figure out how much insulin you need to maintain your weight.  I need 30 units per day and if I go under that I start losing weight.  Do whatever you can to eat to that.


Figure out what foods your body likes.  I also was told to puree my food and that made me feel like crap.  I tried low carb, but I couldn’t eat enough to maintain my weight, so I needed carbs.

Narrow Angle Glaucoma
I am now set  up to have Laser Peripheral Iridotomy. surgery for Narrow Angle Glaucoma.  My eye test from last year was fine and I had my normal eye exam in August and she said I needed to see the specialist and she would not be dilating my eyes.
I just saw the specialist and I have 80% closure in both eyes, so the surgery is set up for January. Only one eye was showing to be a significant problem back in August. Normal pressure levels in my eyes for now. It is surprising how fast it happened, but he said it is an inherited disease and people that are farsighted are at higher risk and more prone to it as you get older. He described it as a clogged sink that is still slowly draining.
If your eyes are dilated with this condition you can set off an acute closure attack, as when the eyes are dilated they expand and can close off all drainage. It is inherited but this type of glaucoma is not directly connected with diabetes. This surgery usually permanently solves the problem, sometimes in a few over time it slowly comes back, but he said by the time if it did, because of my age, I would probably be having cataract surgery which also solves the issue as it allows drainage because of the lens being removed.
But he said it is an inherited genetic disease and likely someone else in the family has had this condition or will have it. I get yearly complete exams because of my diabetes, this disease can have a fast onset. Kind of scary if you’re not getting regular check ups.
Supposedly a very easy surgery, I could walk out and drive home. No pain. But steroid eye drops for 4 days after, which, oh goody, they affected my dog’s blood sugar and I am really sensitive to steroids, but they are needed to keep down swelling after.

Laser Peripheral Iridotomy: Surgery for Narrow-Angle Glaucoma






Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI)
For Narrow Angle Glaucoma
The treatment of narrow angles and narrow-angle glaucoma.
Narrow-angle glaucoma (also known as angle-closure glaucoma) occurs when the angle between the iris and the cornea in the eye is too small. This causes the iris to block fluid drainage, increasing inner eye pressure. LPI makes a small hole in the iris, allowing it to fall back from the fluid channel and helping the fluid drain.",Dec '20
3585,Laser Eye Surgery for Narrow Angle Glaucoma,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,JenType 1 or LADA,2,"I had this procedure done years ago on both eyes (two weeks apart) and both went smoothly. Note that I don’t think having this procedure necessarily means that you have glaucoma, just that you’re at high risk of developing it.
I don’t remember the steroid drops affecting my blood sugar at all. But, then again, I’ve had steroid injections that also didn’t affect my blood sugar. So maybe I am just weirdly immune to the effects of steroids on blood sugar. I definitely did need the drops, though (I took them for a week each eye). My eye was starting to swell shut by the time I picked up the prescription, and I had some irritation during the first 24 hours. I got public transit home, no problem.
I hope the procedure goes well.",Dec '20

If the bolus makes severe lows post meal, sometimes I just bump up the basal.
Even though it might be too much basal, and I might need to have a snack periodically, I find its better, for me, because it helps avoid those really severe post meal lows (which can be brutal). Its a ‘softer’ low, I guess. It drifts in slowly and is less severe and easier to deal with. It helps me adapt to taking a more reasonable amount of bolus.

Some people will take issue with the idea of “forbidden treats” but I hear ya. My practice for a long long time was that it’s much easier for me to have an absolute ban on the things that are going to cause me trouble than to try to manage moderation. I learned this about myself when I quit smoking a million years ago. Had to be absolute cold turkey or it wasn’t gonna happen, so that’s what I did. Never had even a puff since the day I quit, back in the 80s. Which was when I was in my mid-20s, only a couple of years before I got T1, and it was kind of useful as I basically applied the same rule to The List of Stuff You Can’t Eat (which was what it was like back then).

I was honestly quite surprised when I got the call today, because I thought they were calling to say they had to re-do the test, as I didn’t sleep well that night! But I’m surprisingly not upset at all about this diagnosis because I’ve been feeling like an utter zombie for months now. Tired all the time, sleeping away weekends, unable to think at work, can’t concentrate on anything, sometimes feel like I’m just moving through a mental haze. And that’s not even mentioning the physical exhaustion piece, which is just as problematic.

The screen is super small but in color.  I think the newer machines are much easier to see.  As far as masks go, I went by nature (cave man) and finally settled on a ResMed AirFit mask.  Covers mouth and nose,  and the bonus for me is I can get it with either memory foam or Silicone .   The memory foam is cushier but wears out faster.  The silicon lasts a year or more before it needs to be replaced.  The Airfit also has , for me, a very comfortable headstrap with a magnetic closure (instead of a snap).  I find it much more convenient and easier to use, though I never thought magnets would do the job.

I found out that they will take care of all the insurance stuff for me, so fingers crossed my insurance covers the machine and related equipment (I meet all their criteria, so hopefully it won’t be a problem). I also got a copy of my sleep study, which is a much more detailed report than the one I got done several years ago.
I will be very curious what tonight is like.

I sure hope you can find a solution to your sleep apnea soon. Yours does sound much worse than mine. My AHI was 18 and my oxygen dropped to 78% overnight. The nurse set the pressure to 5-15 and the machine automatically adjusts within that range throughout the night.
Today they gave me a Resmed AirSense machine (the “for her” model) with a nasal pillow type mask. I expressed concerns about allergies and the fact I often wake up unable to breathe through my nose, but the nurse thought I should start out with this one and I can always switch to the other type when I see them in a week if I have problems with this one. I’m wondering if it wouldn’t be good to have both types anyway, as I might use one type when my allergies aren’t bad (like now) but want to use the other type when it’s full-blown allergy season.
I have been browsing the two sleep apnea forums mentioned in this thread, but I haven’t yet joined either of them. I’ve been a member of a sleep apnea group on Facebook for some years, so did post a question in there tonight (I forgot to pick up distilled water on my way home). I’m still adjusting to the whole idea of this diagnosis, and I think as I get more comfortable with the CPAP machine, I will be more comfortable joining those forums and really digging in.

Did your machine come with an SD disk? If not, you can always get one separately. Then you can download the Sleepyhead software and really check out the details of how you are sleeping. I discovered that even with the machine many nights I’d have apneas that lasted over a minute, sometimes several in a night.

As far as I could tell, the Sleepyhead software also seemed to have some parts that even the doctor and the DME didn’t seem to have, or at least were willing to take the time to read.
When you get to a point it seems appropriate, the members will link you to videos that help you understand some of the details of the Sleepyhead data, such as how to tell true apnea events from what the machine sees as events but that happened when you were really awake. It isn’t perfect, but there are also clues that help you conclude whether or not you were sleeping when an “event” occurred. It is necessary to zoom in on the breathing wave form to tell. Pretty fascinating stuff if you are into data beyond that which the doctor and DME usually provide. You can also see how often you snored and some clue about the volume of the snores.

I downloaded the Sleepyhead software in the middle of the night last night. I managed to wear the CPAP (APAP? since it’s in auto mode?) for nearly eight hours, but I didn’t sleep so much as just dozed on and off. I found it hard to breathe through my nose at times, and at other times I think the machine changing pressure (or something else about the stream of air) woke me up just as I was dozing off, and at other times the noises were distracting. But actually at other times things were quite relaxing and cozy, especially when I got my breathing steady and with the bit of heat coming through.
The machine’s pressure was all over the place; from the few times I glanced at it, I saw 5.6, 11.8, 9.2, 12.7… According to the statistics in the morning, the AHI was 0.0, so that’s really good. Hopefully it is that good when I sleep for real! I would be interested in understanding exactly what makes the pressure go up and down and how it decides what level is needed at any given time.
Surprisingly, I’d say I’m pretty wide awake today considering it wasn’t the best night’s sleep. So that’s a good sign.
Of course, this morning I was so distracted with all this stuff that I forgot to bolus for breakfast. Cue 30.9 mmol/L (556 mg/dl) blood sugar. I possibly left my pinp disconnected for over an hour as well. Oops. Still trying to get out of the 20s mid-morning.

3650,"What is the connection between diabetes, heart disease, and stroke?",Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,MilaStaff,1,"If you have diabetes, you are at least twice as likely as someone who does not have diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke. People with diabetes also tend to develop heart disease or have strokes at an earlier age than other people. If you are middle-aged and have type 2 diabetes, some studies suggest that your chance of having a heart attack is as high as someone without diabetes who has already had one heart attack. Women who have not gone through menopause usually have less risk of heart disease than men of the same age. But women of all ages with diabetes have an increased risk of heart disease because diabetes cancels out the protective effects of being a woman in her child-bearing years.
People with diabetes who have already had one heart attack run an even greater risk of having a second one. In addition, heart attacks in people with diabetes are more serious and more likely to result in death. High blood glucose levels over time can lead to increased deposits of fatty materials on the insides of the blood vessel walls. These deposits may affect blood flow, increasing the chance of clogging and hardening of blood vessels (atherosclerosis).
Source: NIH",Feb '17
3651,"What is the connection between diabetes, heart disease, and stroke?",Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,MilaStaff,1,"What are the risk factors for heart disease and stroke in people with diabetes?
Diabetes itself is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Also, many people with diabetes have other conditions that increase their chance of developing heart disease and stroke. These conditions are called risk factors. One risk factor for heart disease and stroke is having a family history of heart disease. If one or more members of your family had a heart attack at an early age (before age 55 for men or 65 for women), you may be at increased risk.
You can’t change whether heart disease runs in your family, but you can take steps to control the other risk factors for heart disease listed here:
Having central obesity.
Central obesity means carrying extra weight around the waist, as opposed to the hips. A waist measurement of more than 40 inches for men and more than 35 inches for women means you have central obesity. Your risk of heart disease is higher because abdominal fat can increase the production of LDL (bad) cholesterol, the type of blood fat that can be deposited on the inside of blood vessel walls.
Having abnormal blood fat (cholesterol) levels.
LDL cholesterol can build up inside your blood vessels, leading to narrowing and hardening of your arteriesthe blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Arteries can then become blocked. Therefore, high levels of LDL cholesterol raise your risk of getting heart disease.
Triglycerides are another type of blood fat that can raise your risk of heart disease when the levels are high.
HDL (good) cholesterol removes deposits from inside your blood vessels and takes them to the liver for removal. Low levels of HDL cholesterol increase your risk for heart disease.
Having high blood pressure.
If you have high blood pressure, also called hypertension, your heart must work harder to pump blood. High blood pressure can strain the heart, damage blood vessels, and increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, eye problems, and kidney problems.
Smoking.
Smoking doubles your risk of getting heart disease. Stopping smoking is especially important for people with diabetes because both smoking and diabetes narrow blood vessels. Smoking also increases the risk of other long-term complications, such as eye problems. In addition, smoking can damage the blood vessels in your legs and increase the risk of amputation.",Feb '17

3653,"What is the connection between diabetes, heart disease, and stroke?",Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,MilaStaff,1,"What types of heart and blood vessel disease occur in people with diabetes?
Two major types of heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease, are common in people with diabetes: coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebral vascular disease. People with diabetes are also at risk for heart failure. Narrowing or blockage of the blood vessels in the legs, a condition called peripheral arterial disease, can also occur in people with diabetes.
Coronary Artery Disease
Coronary artery disease, also called ischemic heart disease, is caused by a hardening or thickening of the walls of the blood vessels that go to your heart. Your blood supplies oxygen and other materials your heart needs for normal functioning. If the blood vessels to your heart become narrowed or blocked by fatty deposits, the blood supply is reduced or cut off, resulting in a heart attack.
Cerebral Vascular Disease
Cerebral vascular disease affects blood flow to the brain, leading to strokes and TIAs. It is caused by narrowing, blocking, or hardening of the blood vessels that go to the brain or by high blood pressure.
Stroke
A stroke results when the blood supply to the brain is suddenly cut off, which can occur when a blood vessel in the brain or neck is blocked or bursts. Brain cells are then deprived of oxygen and die. A stroke can result in problems with speech or vision or can cause weakness or paralysis. Most strokes are caused by fatty deposits or blood clots jelly-like clumps of blood cells that narrow or block one of the blood vessels in the brain or neck. A blood clot may stay where it formed or can travel within the body. People with diabetes are at increased risk for strokes caused by blood clots.
A stroke may also be caused by a bleeding blood vessel in the brain. Called an aneurysm, a break in a blood vessel can occur as a result of high blood pressure or a weak spot in a blood vessel wall.
TIAs
TIAs are caused by a temporary blockage of a blood vessel to the brain. This blockage leads to a brief, sudden change in brain function, such as temporary numbness or weakness on one side of the body. Sudden changes in brain function also can lead to loss of balance, confusion, blindness in one or both eyes, double vision, difficulty speaking, or a severe headache. However, most symptoms disappear quickly and permanent damage is unlikely. If symptoms do not resolve in a few minutes, rather than a TIA, the event could be a stroke. The occurrence of a TIA means that a person is at risk for a stroke sometime in the future. See page 3 for more information on risk factors for stroke.
Heart Failure
Heart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart cannot pump blood properly it does not mean that the heart suddenly stops working. Heart failure develops over a period of years, and symptoms can get worse over time. People with diabetes have at least twice the risk of heart failure as other people. One type of heart failure is congestive heart failure, in which fluid builds up inside body tissues. If the buildup is in the lungs, breathing becomes difficult.
Blockage of the blood vessels and high blood glucose levels also can damage heart muscle and cause irregular heart beats. People with damage to heart muscle, a condition called cardiomyopathy, may have no symptoms in the early stages, but later they may experience weakness, shortness of breath, a severe cough, fatigue, and swelling of the legs and feet. Diabetes can also interfere with pain signals normally carried by the nerves, explaining why a person with diabetes may not experience the typical warning signs of a heart attack.
Peripheral Arterial Disease
Another condition related to heart disease and common in people with diabetes is peripheral arterial disease (PAD). With this condition, the blood vessels in the legs are narrowed or blocked by fatty deposits, decreasing blood flow to the legs and feet. PAD increases the chances of a heart attack or stroke occurring. Poor circulation in the legs and feet also raises the risk of amputation. Sometimes people with PAD develop pain in the calf or other parts of the leg when walking, which is relieved by resting for a few minutes.

I’m adopted. I didn’t find my biological mother until I was in my early 20’s. She wouldn’t give me any information about my biological father and she didn’t know any of his health information. I basically stopped talking to her for 20 years. It wasn’t until I took the 23 & Me DNA test and a half sister popped up on the biological father’s side of the family that I began talking to her again. Eventually she fessed up to who he was…along with the situation. However, I contacted a couple of the cousins it showed me related to so that I could ask about the medical history that ran in the family. A little too late I guess. I found out my diagnosis after it was already advanced enough to cause issues.
I can hope my daughters will take the information and apply it to their medical notes so that they can at least be screened for everything at a much earlier age. My Cardiologist (the one I fired in the hospital just recently) was perplexed as to how to continue my treatment due to my age and the stage I’m in. He said he could see it if I were in my 60s…but I’ll be 44 in about two weeks. Thankfully he had referred me to a Heart Failure Specialist before I fired him that I have continued to see. She informed me that up until about 10 years ago, Diastolic Heart Failure was not even recognized as a diagnosis. There isn’t as many treatment options available as there is for Systolic Heart Failure. Basically all they can do is treat the symptoms. That’s not acceptable to me, as treating the symptoms is not working that well.
I have a virtual appointment this morning (in about 3 hours) with a Cardiologist at Mayo Clinic in Florida. I live in Tennessee. I found out during my research that they are currently conducting several Clinical Trials for Diastolic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction. I want in on those Clinical Trials!!! Maybe it’ll give me more years with my family…maybe it’ll also help them find better treatments for those diagnosed later - generations after mine. I can hope they’ll allow me into the program. I’m ready to get this show on the road. I’m NOT going to lay down and give up. That’s what my depression wants me to do.
Please keep your fingers crossed, pray, send positive thoughts, etc my way for this appointment…and that they will find me acceptable for their programs. I truly feel like they are my answer for this. I am not aware of any other studies, and Mayo is in network with my insurance. I’ve met my deductible for the year.

The etiology is overworked heart muscle which thickens and becomes unable to pump fluids through your body.
In my case it’s coincident with pulmonary hypertension, a chronic condition that makes difficult to breath. The PH is idiopathic, but it wouldn’t surprise me at all if you also have PH (sleep apnea is often a symptom).
Nonetheless, the symptoms are pretty much the same: extreme fatigue, inability to climb stairs or walk any distance without laboured breathing, chest pressure and inability to catch your breath, edema, fluid buildup (pulmonary edema) especially at night, nocturnal dyspnea.

The Effects of Cannabinoids in the Gastrointestinal System
The gastrointestinal actions of cannabinoids are mediated chiefly by CB1 receptors (Figure 2). Activation of CB1 receptors result in inhibition of gastric acid secretion, lower esophageal sphincter relaxation [40], altered intestinal motility [41,42], visceral pain, and inflammation [9,43]. CB1 receptor activation reduces gastric motility and results in delayed gastric emptying in rat models [44,45]. In humans, THC given at doses used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting causes a significant delay in gastric emptying [46]. These findings in humans are further supported by a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with dronabinol that resulted in a significant delay in gastric emptying [47]. In comparison to other adverse effects associated with cannabinoids, delayed gastric emptying appears to be particularly resistant to the development of tolerance [48]. Additionally, intermittent administration of THC results in hypersensitization of the delayed gastric emptying effect [49]. THC’s effect on gastric motility is a paradox, as a delay in gastric emptying would be expected to promote nausea and vomiting [50]. However, nausea and vomiting traditionally do not occur with cannabis use, likely due to the anti-emetic properties of THC on the central nervous system.

I just created an account because I feel the need to create awareness in the correlation between weed and Gastroparesis.

Recently my wife was diagnosed with Gastroparesis after years of vomiting, nausea and abdominal pain. My wife is a weed smoker… She is addicted to it. We being from Drs to Drs and none of them seems aware of this.
While I was doing research I concluded that Gastroparesis couldn’t be the cause of all her symptoms. Worst yet? Lot of ppl recommend weed for Gastroparesis.
One day I was so overwhelmed by my wife being constantly sick even with treatment for Gastroparesis that I started doing research and found lots of cases similar to my wife.
I told myself or my wife has CVS and Gastroparesis is a trigger point or she have CHS.
Well the fact is that weed can have a negative impact in your GI and cause Gastroparesis as a.secondary effect. Once my wife stopped weed the Gastroparesis disappeared. She is lot better now.
This doesn’t have any relation with mind, weed can alter CB1 receptora slowing down GI motility.
CVS and CHS are pretty much the same in terms of symptoms.
If you have Gastroparesis, you smoke weed, and you feel very sick with nausea and vomiting a lot please stop weed. I suggest you start a 2 way solution.

I went to physical therapy for a few months and didn’t make much progress in terms of reduced pain or large improvements in range of motion.
The physical therapist recommended that I see my primary care provider for another consult. My provider referred my to a sports medicine specialist and following x-rays and an exam, she gave me the frozen shoulder diagnosis. She thought I would benefit from a corticosteroid injection into my right shoulder joint.
Her theory is that this will give me the opportunity to work the joint, muscles, and soft tissue more fully. She warned however, that if I didn’t put a full effort into the post-injection physical therapy, then when the steroid shot effects wear off, my shoulder would likely feel worse than it does now.
My biggest concern with the steroid injection was the havoc it could create with my blood glucose. I consulted with my diabetes doctor and she said the hyperglycemia would likely be limited to the first three or four days post-injection. I figured I could deal with that and decided to get the cortisone injection.
I had read some comments in a few diabetes online communities and learned that increasing the basal insulin could counteract the increased insulin reisistance that comes from the shot.
I decided to increase all my pump basal rates by 50% or 1.5 times my current basal rates. I did this one hour before the injection and have been pleasantly surprised with the results. I know that this type of thing can easily vary from person to person but I thought I’d share my results. I should also note that I use an automated insulin dosing system that dynamically adjust programmed pump basal rates up and down as needed. This system has actually increased my +50% basal rates even more.
I received my steroid injection at noon yesterday, May 16. I’m especially pleased with my overnight trace that stayed in range and didn’t drive me hypo. Here are the traces from yesterday and today.

I had a steroid shot earlier this year for severe allergies. I decided to wait until I saw an effect on my blood sugar to raise my basal rates, and am glad I did, because in the end it had NO impact whatsoever. In fact, I actually had to lower my basal rates.
I learned that steroid shots can have no effect, a mild effect, or a more pronounced effect in different people and even the same person at different times. My other theory is that maybe allergies were stressing my body out enough (from lack of sleep, not breathing well, etc.) that it was causing more insulin resistance than the steroid shot itself caused.
I’ve been offered oral steroids and steroid shots several times before for allergies and have always turned them down because I was scared of the effects on my BG. I will never turn them down in future after my experience and knowing that even if they did have an impact on my BG, I could probably handle it with raised nasals and more corrections.

Well, I am taking an increased total daily dose of insulin so I know that my insulin resistance   did go up. It always helps to be lucky!

Yes, I’m still using Loop. My +50% basal rates equal 19.7 units per day. Loop adds and subtracts to that programmed pump basal rates. The net effect in the last 24 hours after adding the aggregate of the positive temp basals and subtracting the aggregate of the negative temp basal adds about another 7 units basal.
I haven’t changed my insulin to carb mealtime bolus calculation. The Loop initiated temp basals likely compensate to some extent for keeping the bolus ratio fixed.

3677,"Frozen shoulder, my BG experience after a steroid shot",Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Terry4,1,"I had my first meal around noon today and the bolus insulin resistance has really ramped up. My evening meal yesterday saw my BG rise above the 140+ (7.8+) level for about an hour and topping at 162 (9) before it returned in range.
Todays meal gave me a run for the money. It rose to 140+ (7.8) territory and stayed there for almost four hours topping off at 171 (9.5). As my blood sugar rapidly rose to 140 (7.8) ninety minutes after eating, I took a 40-minute walk. This action alone would have returned me to in-range in prior days.

Immediately after I finished walking, at 2:20 p.m. with blood glucose trending into the 150s (8.3), I took a 4 unit IM (intra-muscular) correction along with an Afrezza 4U correction. The force on the other side was not impressed. I followed with 4U Afrezza corrections at 3:24 p.m. and 4:28 p.m. In addition to these corrections, I’m also biasing my Loop system to be more aggressive with its high temp basal rates by moving the target down to 65 (3.6) instead of the usual 83 (4.6). Am I breaking any insulin-stacking rules? Good.
Prior to this meal, I thought that my basal increases provided me with a solid platform to use normal insulin to carb ratios to keep meals under control. It didn’t work out that way. And it makes sense. If steroids increase insulin resistance, that resistance should be apparent with both the basal and bolus doses.
I’ve decided to skip the last meal of the day today and do an intermittent 24-hour fast. Fasts for me always increase insulin sensitivity. I will go out for a 30-minute walk this evening, too.
Fighting this high reminds of times in the past trying to control BGs when enduring an infection. It’s a little bit daunting throwing all those insulin darts at the hyper-trend but that’s what it takes.

Can you provide more info about why your desperate to change it?


The main reason is my diabetes control.  When it was playing up, i had unexplained lows throughout the night.  I just kept hypo’ing which was scary.  That happened for about a week or two and then it stabilised again.  I adjusted my basal and bolus during that period to lower it and by the time I got the right dose, the hypo’ing went away and I had to revert back to my initial dose slowly.  During the day, my sugars were all over the place but it was easier to managed when you are not half asleep.  At one stage I was shaky when i put out my hands in mid air - that the feeling wasn’t too great.
Also I’ve had it for 20 years or so… and it hasn’t gone away, just keeps coming back even after it was under control for a while.  While it hasn’t really affected me for majority of those years, I’ve noticed in the past 5 years, the symptoms are stronger and more noticeable.  Things like anxious, sweating, tiredness that I have been constantly experiencing over the years, thinking back in hindsight, i suspect it is somewhat linked to the condition but at the time I thought it was just me.  I wonder if i’m underactive, will all these symptoms disappear.
I worry about weight gain, I’ve struggled with keeping my weight down even though i exercise everyday.  I exercise more than most people around me and while they seem to be losing weight, my weight is just constant.   I have found it very hard to shed a kilo or two even though my shirt is drenched in sweat after exercising.  When I spoke to my doctor about this, he mentioned it may have to do with insulin. i don’t know.  I’m currently overactive with the thyroids which is more susceptible to weight loss but it’s not happening on me despite the efforts I put in, imagine if I was underactive!",Sep '20

I take a different medicine than the others have mentioned, though   I use Armour Thyroid, which rather than being a synthetic version of T3, is actual dessicated thyroid hormones.  Normally people convert T3 to T4, but I don’t do that well, so benefit from having it in the medication.
I personally wouldn’t wish hypothyroidism on anyone, it’s not very well understood and hard to get properly treated, since it’s not just about having one result out of range, but having the right balance of all of them.  Most doctors just throw Synthroid at it, and up your dose until you feel better or your labs look better, regardless of how you feel.
I only got the right treatment for myself because I’ve got the medical background to decipher the results, and requested the correct medicine.  How many other people can advocate that well for themselves, though.

Unfortunately, that’s another shortcoming of Control-IQ.  They made a DRASTIC change to the insulin decay model, which is wayyyy more accurate, but completely foreign to people.  They chose to lock the duration of insulin action in at 5 hours for everyone, rather than teach us about the change.  It works great for nearly everyone who was using a DIA of anywhere near 3 hours before, but it’s a little problematic for someone like me who was already using 5 hours before.  It’s not a deal breaker for me, but if I have a large spike for whatever reason, I have to proactively switch the pump to it’s highest target range (exercise mode), otherwise it will over-correct for insulin it doesn’t know I still have on board. It’s a little counter-intuitive and a lot annoying.



 tedos:

No, I don’t think there’s a win.  You’re going to have to decide which one you’re more comfortable struggling with.  I don’t really consider my hypothyroidism to be sporadic, though.  It was difficult to get treatment at all at first, and then difficult to get the right treatment, but once it was all figured out, it’s been fairly consistent.  My biggest problem is that the pills are MINISCULE.  If I preset my prescriptions in a pill organizer, which helps me remember to actually take them, the thyroid pills are so tiny that they can actually feel through the cracks of the dividers.  I’m supposed to take three a day, but there’s a good chance of really getting 2 or 4.  I know when I got four because my heart will race and I feel anxious.  If I only got 2, then I’ll feel sluggish, irritable, and achey.  I’ve definitely gained some weight over the years, but I’m going to chalk that up more to reducing my A1c in half and taking more insulin… And lots of good food.  .
I don’t deal well with the unexpected.  I get mad when things don’t go as I planned.  I think the hypothyroidism is a little more consistent and predictable than what you explained your currently experiencing, so I think if I had to choose between the two, I would choose Hypo over Hyper.  But, that’s just me.  Maybe racing heart and random hypos (which Basal-IQ will do a lot to prevent once you’re up and running on the G6) is more appealing to you than potential weight gain and learning to adjust to a new diagnosis.",Sep '20

Ok thanks, that really helps put things into perspective.  I think hyper is also in the same boat in a way, I only find it sporadic when the treatment is not right and the thyroid levels are out of wack - over time, my dosage is either too strong or too weak and you can’t really tell without a blood test and it’s been variable over the years.  The other times it just sits in the background and I don’t think much of it even when they surface - i just think it is what it is.

I’ve been a type II diabetic for about 12 years first controlled by diet and exercise.  Started Metforim 500 Mg about 9 years ago. My doctor was never really concerned about my glucose levels since my A1C was always under 6.5.  In recent months it’s been in the 6.1 range. I am thin, exercise and eat very healthy (low carb).  However, I started experiencing severe neuropathy over my entire body about a year ago, including red burning feet.  My doctor said he did not think it was from diabetes.  I went to 4 different doctors … 2 neurologists, rheumatologist, cardiologist and lastly a holistic doctor. Still no definitive diagnosis, I finally made an appointment with Cleveland Clinic myself and just returned.  Diagnosis? Small fiber neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy caused by diabetes!  From what I understand and from the research I have done, glucose intolerance and pre-diabetes can cause just as much nerve damage as with a full-blown case.  Cleveland Clinic recommend I see a endocrinologist.  Also told me to take 600 mg. of Alpha Lipoic Acid since it has been proven to help nerves regenerate when taken at least a year. Just wondering if anyone else has had neuropathy come on suddenly?  Not sure if the endocrinologist will recommend any thing different for me.",Oct '18

Alpha-Lipoic acid may help, but if you can’t stop whatever is causing this (high blood sugars), then likely it will be progressive, which is not a nice prospect at all.
Have you ever worn a CGM?  How high are your highs? Even if they come down there is some school of thought that highs do cause damage, and that very tight control (keeping sugars in the 70 to 120 range all the time may be helpful).
Your best bet might be taking all efforts to reduce blood sugar to truly normal levels which are hba1c in the 4.2 - 4.8 range (if one follows Bernstein), but definitely in the low 5s.  And Blood sugars as stable as possible and as close to 83 as they can be maintained!  Sounds like you are already doing the diet and exercise thing, so the next step is medications - other than metformin.  Best bet would probably be insulin.
Have you been properly tested for type of diabetes?  Could you be type 1 (adult onset)?   If you are tested and found to be insulin deficient, low dose insulin may help you get much tighter control.
Suggest you research and decide what you want from this endocrinologist and then request it.

3748,I cured my serious neuropathy completely in 2003,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,JaninaWalker,,"My neuropathy came on in 8 days on an antibiotic called Cipro of the fluoroquinolone class.I used all kinds of supplements once a day and that did not help for 3 months.  The drug gabapentin they put you on does not help, but gives such bad side effects that it makes you worse.The answer is to take a lot of supplements once a day...I will list them, and then take your own injections of B vitamins....you can easily do it as anyone who injects insulin knows how to do injections into subcutaneous fat. I improved 50% in just two weeks, after having been in extreme pain all over my body for 12 weeks...I had felt that suicide might be necessary....it was like having a tooth ache all over the body...feet, hands, skin on back, around the stomach, the legs....that was 2002. I researched on the Internet, as my boyfriend had come to look after me.  The gabapentin made my blood pressure go down to 80/50 and it did not reduce the pain at all.  So when the 60 capsules were finished, I asked for Tylenol 3 and did more research, on the Internet, and with 3 books. I was taking a lot of supplements once a day, but that did not help. Then I asked my GP for 3 vials of 30ml B vitamins as he uses them in his clinic, so he gets large vials.1=Methylcobalamin B122=B63=Bcomplex =B1,B2,B3,B5,B6then I added in oral folic acid, Biotin....etcI am not putting all the details now because I have to remember it all.  I've had a couple of hard drive crashes. What I suggest is that anyone can find a practitioner who does ""chelation therapy""  and you go ask them if they will sell you the three vials from their stocks.  I only needed 4 months of injections and when I finished the B12, I just bought one more B12 and carried on for a full 1 year and 5 weeks, which is what time it took to finish 4 vials of 30ml. Even though I had already been cured for many months,  I knew the B vitamins were good for me, so I would not throw them out. I then went off supplements for three years to see if the neuropathy would come back, and it didn't, but my mood is always better when taking B vitamins, so I even have 2 vials on the go now, that will end up lasting me over a year at a cost of just $75 for both of them.I currently can get a ""B complex forte"" version that has more B6 in it and a better balance of the 5 Bs, so that is simpler than 3 vials.  However, a chelation practitioner may not regularly buy the ""forte version"" of B complex, so I will suggest the plan I used in 2002, that I figured out on my own.So that is what this ""Discussion"" will be for....to indicate the whole collection of supplements that can cure neuropathy. Naturally, keeping blood sugar levels under 10 also is important, but even if I currently go over 30, I still don't get back the neuropathy...except there were 2 days, when I was under extreme stress of a flood in my home, and I had to use juice boxes as I had nothing else to fend off lows from extreme exercise bailing water.  So that was so unusual Aug 20-21 2009, that I don't consider it a true return of neuropathy.  I so rarely drink juices.  The 200ml boxes are in the fridge for extreme reactions. The way to look up a chelation practitioner is to go to the www.ACAM.org 108 web site and enter your postal code etc. to find one who is also an MD.Also, there are likely many NDs that do chelation, so just enter into google  ""chelation therapy"" and your location, and find one near you. Given that I improved 50% in 2 weeks....you should try it....who is interested? I've almost forgotten what it was like, given that was 2003. Let's say the 3 vials of 30ml are about $30 each and you get another later of B12...then the $120  will last you over a year, so a cost of $10 a month should not be scary, and most of you already take insulin by subcutaneous injection, so why not B vitamins?  I can assure you that your MOOD will improve too and also your blood sugar management improves, although I can't say exactly why.  I tried a new C-peptide test to see if it increases my own production, but that was false, it actually is so low it is oinly 14. So while B vitamins help me take less insulin, I can't say what the exact mechanism of action is, although I know B vitamins are used in the metabolism of food. If you choose to use B vitamins orally, then still use the B supplements 3x day, because I say I did not improve at all with once a day.  Also B vitamins require friendly bacteria in the intestines and intrinsic factor in the gut for absorption, so that is why I decided the injection manner would be more effective and it sure did work.  I was taking just a mix of 20u, but 5x a day....for the 2 weeks.Then when I saw it was working, I did just 3x a day injections every 8 hours.   This was all based on a study I found that said that 80% of B vitamins were gone from the blood within 8 hours, so I decided OK that means 3x a day injections....but I'll try it more frequently first, to see how it works....so I settled on a mix of 20u every 4 hours while awake, but slept 8 hours.So, people with neuropathy, how about you try it?  Just add in the 20u 5x a day injections for 2 weeks and see how it goes....it is not a waste of your money because I can say that everyone says it improves mood too.  I notice that and so do others whom I have helped. You won't find a place to buy small 10ml vials of B vitamins, except B12 and B6.  I can guaranatee that only taking B12 by injection is not enough...also it has to be methylcobalamin, not the cheaper cyanocobalamin.  The liver would have to be counted on to change the cyano into methyl and I decided it was worth just getting the fully active form of B12. So, I've given you enough information to go on.  I'm not selling anything.  I'll just wait to see how many people try it and improve....if you don't try, you'll never find out.I'll answer any questions gladly, in this forum, so everyone can see the questions and answers.If you don't try, you'll be missing out. I could ALSO ASK...are there any others who have already tried it, by injection?  I don't mean just B12...I mean a mix of all the Bs and even 3x a day of oral folic acid?I am fairly certain, the reason I did so well was that I also continued the Vit C in high doses, the magnesium and other supplements is regular doses.  In other words a single supplement will not cure anyone....it takes a wide variety, so it does take more than just the B vitamins by injection.",Dec '10
3749,I cured my serious neuropathy completely in 2003,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,JaninaWalker,,"Naturally, I checked all the safety issues. A,D,E, K are the fat soluble vitamins and they were all within easy safety limits. The B6 issue, that you will read about, was very small at 2.5mg per injection so even at 5x a day that is 12.5mg and that is far below the concern of 500mg or even 200mg total per day. That was one of the reasons I chose to do the therapy via injection as opposed to via oral supplements where more is taken due to the problem of absorption difficulties. That is referring to only the B6.
As we know, even standard conventional medicine routinely injects a whole 1cc of B12 at one time. In my opinion that is not as effective as much smaller amounts more consistently to ensure that less is wasted down the toilet. As one study said that 80% is gone within 8 hours, that is why I decided on 3x a day and decided to call it “room service for the nerves.”
I knew about the Tylenol concerns and so I kept my amounts as low as possible from Oct 2002 to Jan 2003 and then did not need to renew the prescription. I would resort to Tylenol 1 if needed. I do not feel any benefit in taking Tylenol. I did not detect that it gives any feeling of being an “upper” like maybe other pain medications like Valium, which I have had just once in my life, so I do know what that feels like, as it was given in a hospital.
If people want to instead take pain medications for the rest of their life, I guess that is the standard conventional medicine approach, but it was not going to be my choice for life. When I set out doing my research, I had no idea what the outcome would be.
I still say it is worth each person with neuropathy trying it. If a person has had the problem for many years, possibly it may take longer to reverse, but it still is worth trying it. And above all, remember that nerves hurt MORE when they are regenerating, which is one concept that people find very hard to understand and I think that is precisely why so many people stop everything that starts to be effective…see the problem in that? That is also why it is so important to do the 5x a day routine, even though more trouble, because it brings a quicker solution. I was in a hurry, as anyone would want the pain to stop ASAP.
As soon as you notice an improvement, you then know that it is just time that is required. Also, keep blood sugar levels down, as anyone who has neuropathy can readily attest to the fact that pain is higher if the blood sugar level goes very high.
Also, I had made a batch of red wine in the spring of 2009, and had literally had 375 ml about 5 nights a week prior to the one incident when I had the flood. That was a co-incidence, but I would say that my B vitamin levels were likely compromised. I did not have B vials on the go at that time, until Oct 2009, when I decided to start again. So, every which way you look at it, the B vitamins help, and alcohol is a detriment. As we should all know from our reading that the liver stores B vitamins, among it various jobs, and alcohol does not help. My GGT level is actually 14, so I do not have a liver problem. I can also say that it is vitamin C calcium ascorbate taking that has kept my liver healthy.",Dec '10

But anyway I will answer here.....I just took another injection this morning. And I took one last night before going to bed. The injection is into fat, but eventually gets to the blood stream, as it does with our insulin injections.10u MethylB12 + 5u B complex +5u B6 =20u total but after inverting it many times so it is well mixed, I inject half in one location and pull it out and inject the other half in another location. I have just started doing that splitting of location so less goes into each location, recently.The best solution is to do so 3x a day evenly spaced, but if you work, then inject in the morning, take a B50 capsule at lunch while at work, and inject on arriving home and then inject before bed. Two of these vials need to be kept in the fridge, but the B12 can be kept completely covered, in the dark at room temperature because if it were also in the fridge, you would find the coldness of the injection very hard to bear and I have not even tried that. The B12 will say on the bottle to keep in the fridge, but I can't be bothered with that as I learned it is fairly stable at room temp and I could not bear the idea of the stinging of the large injections....BUT I am now planning a new approach with my next set, as I have decided on the splitting of location for the injections.So you are the FIRST person I have mentioned this to as I am deciding as I write this....I will do equal amounts of each vial 5u+5u+5u=15u, but inject into two locations 7u+ each place, as per the DrB suggestion of ""rule of small numbers"" where he says no more than 7u injected in one location even though multiple injections may be done at the same time, one after the other. It will NOT take a mixing of more than one shot, but just an injection and push the plunger half way and pull out and inject elsewhere and push the rest in...simple.My rationale in 2002 had been B12 at room temp would warm up the cold other two and make the 20u injection easier to bear. It worked, but the B12 runs out before the other two, so I usually get another B12 when one runs out.But as I do not use the the injections as frequently, these days, as I am using them for general health and to boost my red blood cell count which is working.

3756,I cured my serious neuropathy completely in 2003,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,JaninaWalker,,"To RW The problem with any antibiotic taking is that it kills friendly bacteria that B6 needs to be absorbed through the friendly bacteria in the intestines. So please try plenty of yogurt of the plain type as the fruit in yogurt is more like jam. You need more friendly bacteria in you. So, if you want to get a B50 capsule and skip the injections do the capsules 3x a day. You might get better quite fast, but even if you do order the vials from a compounding pharmacy, as I don't recommend use of cyanocobalamin to anyone as cyanide is dropped off when the body translates it into the human methyl form.So, a short plan might be plenty of yogurt for re establishment of the friendly bacteria and then take B50 3x a day. You might be better then in two months and the cost of 180 or 210 capsules of B50 can be quite inexpensive at around $15 and 180 would last two months at 3 per day. But don't forget to get a high quality MultiVitMin to take twice a day and that would cost about $34 a month, but the brand I have tried that is excellent has a serious downfall if having titanium dioxide on each of the 14 capsules a day to take and I developed an itchy feeling and searched and found someone else found that and was told to spill out the contents, so I do that, but the taste is so terrible that I can't be bothered. I have various types of MultiVitMins on the go so I use one when I can hide it in tomato sauce and another when I am not eating food I can do that with. I did give my recommendation to the Swanson vitamin shop and they ignored my suggestion as I BET they did not wish to place my comment as it would reduce buyers. I simply suggested they use a clear gelatin capsule instead of a capsule painted with white pain just so they could put their initials on it. So instead the Dr Julian Whitaker's Forward Plus Box of capsules and a gel oil capsule in nice packets to take twice a day is far superior.",Aug '12
3757,I cured my serious neuropathy completely in 2003,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,JaninaWalker,,"To RW again If you try the short oral approach first for 2 months and if it doesn't work then try the injections, but still take all the others. Life is not simple. And if you fed a child would you say. ""for simplicity I will feed you just one thing to eat and once a day,"" do you think the child would thrive or get sicker? So the nerves are poor little children who do need a varied diet. But I do understand the need for simplicity for the person who has to do the purchasing and taking etc. But remember 80% of water soluble Bvits are gone within 8 hours so to feed the nerves once a day will mean it will take a whole year. So I am serious when I say it requires multiple overlapping doses of 3x a day. That is why supplements are taken twice a day for people who are not sick. They strike a balance for simplicity as people who work do not want to bother at lunch. But if you plan to use Bvits in any way just once a day, it will take a whole year to see improvement in neuropathy and that way people will begin to say it happened on it's own and forget the association with the Bvits. Oh I have heard all sorts of objections as some people even my own mother before she died in 1992, said she was healthy and got enough in what she ate...oh how wrong she was. She died super skinny and of a congestive heart attack, at granted a late age of 78, but she could have lived 20 years longer. She was a very light smoker.

I think the neuropathy that Janine initially described was due to a side effect of drugs called fluoroquinolines (e.g. A name brand is Cipro) which is an a type of antibiotic.  This drug now has a black box warning as required by the FDA.
Is your neuropathy due to this type of antibiotic or diabetes?  If diabetes, controlling your blood sugar is most likely the best place you can start.  If you suspect vitamin deficiencies, you can ask your doctor to run some lab tests to confirm.",Oct '17

3766,I cured my serious neuropathy completely in 2003,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,JaninaWalker,,Very definitely Metformin is a prime cause of neuropathy.  So thank God you have a smart doctor to take you off the damned metformine.  It drives down B12 levels and if you were on a higher quality Multi Vitamin Mineral than the useless store brand that gets a 0.5/5 star rating she was able to get rid of the neuropathy in under three months.,Oct '17
3767,I cured my serious neuropathy completely in 2003,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,JaninaWalker,,"You are very definitely misguided by anyone who tells you it was not due to medication as medications are indeed a prime cause of neuropathy.  I got my case in 2002 by just taking 8 days of an antibiotic and I solved it by the end of 6 months and have had no problem at all since 2003.
Doctors are inclined to say it was not a medication if they feel they need to protect themselves from being sued for having put the person on that drug.  If you do any research on the Internet you can easily find that drugs very definitely DO cause neuropathy.  That does not mean that all people on that drug will get neuropathy and the drug manufacturers do not with to withdraw the drugs from the market so they are very unlikely to agree that drugs are a cause, but they definitely DO cause some cases.  I know as I have helped more people who got neuropathy while not even being diabetic but they had taken the fluoroquinolone antibiotics.  So that defies the concept that high blood sugars are the cause as the people were not even diabetic.  Cipro, short for Ciprofloxacin, Avelox and Levaquin are part of the class called fluoroquinolone Antibioticss and sold in Canada and there are others in the USA in that class.  There are even web sites which talk of this and they call it being floxed.  The solution is NOT ever to accept being put on an antiepileptic medication as that does not help at all and would only perpetuate the problem and make you adapt to the drug and then not be able to come off it without extreme withdrawal syndromes that are even worse than neuropathy.

I’m not sure if this is even the right place to pose this as I’m very new to this forum site but it’s been very helpful in finding some information I need.
Five days ago I had Vitrectomy surgery after some bleeding that caused floaters and blurred vision, there was no rush for this to be done and I waited around 3 months, mainly because I’m only 30 and there was no retinal detachment, just discomfort.
The surgery went well and everything was cleared up in my left eye and I now have X4 drops per day in the effected eye, my only issue is I have no idea what the recovery time should be or when I will start to see improvements. My surgeon has gone away for 4 weeks so I don’t have a checkup until he’s back but my vision is at around 15% currently, only seeing rough shapes and very dimmed light. As I didn’t have any retinal detachment and the surgery was relatively quick I was expecting better results and I’m terrified that my eye isn’t healing at all.
Am I worrying too much too soon? I won’t know anything until 3 weeks time when my surgeon is back but any advise on any others who’ve had the same and how long it took before vision restored. My vision was no where near this bad pre-op and I’m worried it won’t heal.

Doctors usually set up some type of back-up coverage when they are unavailable to support their patients. While your questions don’t sound like an emergency, I understand your concern. It’s your eyesight we’re talking about and it’s important – especially in such a young guy.
Give the doctor’s office a call and see if you can talk on the phone with a back-up doctor. Your symptoms may be totally routine and if that’s true then knowing that would comfort you as you heal.
I’m sorry, I’ve not had a vitrectomy, so I can’t help you with that. I’ve read many comments over the years about this topic from others here, so I think you’ll hear from at least a few of them. I’m currently recovering from cataract surgery in both eyes so I understand a little about your concern. I do have a condition known as an epiretinal membrane whose principle treatment is a vitrectomy, so that’s why your post caught my eye.
Good luck with learning more. Follow up with your doctor’s office and talk to his/her back-up. Your concern is legit and should not be dismissed.",Aug '20

If you didn’t get a gas bubble, did they put in silicone oil? When I last had a vitrectomy, about five years ago, this was the method they used. You don’t have to lie in a certain position for weeks, but you generally require a second vitrectomy several months later to remove the oil and replace it with saline. Unless there’s now a completely new method I haven’t heard of!
Vision recovery does, as you say, differ by patient. I’ve heard people say it takes a week or so, and for others it takes months. What you particularly want to look out for is anything that looks like a curtain or a veil across your vision, often from the top or one side to about halfway down. Not to scare you, but this is a sign of a retinal detachment, and you should hustle to your hospital if that happens.

I had two of them done about 25 years ago (I was 36 and developed retinopathy spontaneously in both eyes). I had a great deal of concern, because over the space of 18 months I lost total vision in both my eyes.
I’m happy to say that with laser photo-coagulation and vitrectomies, I had complete recovery of total vision in both eyes. As I recall the return of vision was a 6-12 week agonizingly slow process, but ultimately I had full vision.

My understanding is that it can. The silicone is a heavy oil, so it exerts pressure on the retina. Ideally this gives the retina time to “heal” in place properly and permanently before the oil is replaced (or, in the case of a gas bubble, before the bubble is absorbed into the saline).

Prior to vitrectomy, I was scheduled for laser treatments, but delayed due to equipment issues, and not that many places had them.  So my eyes worsened, but eventually was able to get laser treated.  However within 6 months, more bleeds, and they recommended vitrectomy.
I was admitted to hospital late afternoon, for procedure to be done following day, 6am.  I was put under, and not sure how long procedure took.  Back in room, I had to lay face down, and on soft/liquid diet for 3 days, before release.
The equipment used back then was more risky, so it was recommended to delay procedure so by the time I had it, my vision was hand motion only.  Fortunately I did recover significant sight, but took a while.  Had vitrectomy 15 years later on other eye and was surprised when done as office visit!

What are the times of the ride? Looking at the BG trace, I wasn’t sure the start and stop time.
Are you sure it was medium intensity? Heat could be a factor. The same speed and distance that is easy in cool weather will be much harder in hot weather, and will make your body feel like it is working harder.

3816,Unusual very high BGs after 8 mile road bike ride,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Timothy,1,"I had this same issue when I was training for a triathlon many years back. Exercise lowers your sugar and your insulin resistance so sugars can jump around more quickly.
What I discovered is that low sugars cause a glycogen dump much quicker when I’m exercising.
It will happen in the low 80s. Instead of the low 60’s. Once that happens I would go super high then super low in pretty fast succession. I learned to not allow my sugar to go low and it prevented the highs too.
I would not start till I was over 130. As I start dipping under 100 I would consume carb gel like gu or something similar.
The carb gels have a slow absorption so it gives you a more even and steady level throughout your ride. It also prevents your liver from dumping glycogen.

My typical breakfast is high protein with eggs and sausage with salad most days. Along with coffee and whole cream.
Regarding medium intensity, I have learned to back off my biking speed as I think adrenalin was kicking in. But this morning it really jumped.
Coming home it did not jump so perhaps it IS related to the dawn effect compounding the BG rise.

If you get up at the same time everyday (you may have to do this), and see the same pattern reliably, then you need to bump up the basal insulin delivery 2 - 4 hours prior to officially waking up. If you take shots, you may need to split the dose of basal insulin into one before bed and one in the morning (a higher dose). This will provide some overlap between the two injections and hit you with a bunch of insulin in the morning.
Patterns change over time. So, you might see this behavior for a few months, then it might disappear. That’s not uncommon. Patterns typically last 2-3 months, for me, before adjustments are necessary.

3828,Nutritional and medical food therapies for diabetic retinopathy,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Diabetes Complications and other Conditions,Yerachmiel,1,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a form of microangiopathy. Reducing oxidative stress in the mitochondria and cell membranes decreases ischemic injury and end-organ damage to the retina. New approaches are needed, which reduce the risk and improve the outcomes of DR while complementing current therapeutic approaches. Homocysteine (Hcy) elevation and oxidative stress are potential therapeutic targets in DR. Common genetic polymorphisms such as those of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), increase Hcy and DR risk and severity. Patients with DR have high incidences of deficiencies of crucial vitamins, minerals, and related compounds, which also lead to elevation of Hcy and oxidative stress. Addressing the effects of the MTHFR polymorphism and addressing comorbid deficiencies and insufficiencies reduce the impact and severity of the disease. This approach provides safe and simple strategies that support conventional care and improve outcomes. Suboptimal vitamin co-factor availability also impairs the release of neurotrophic and neuroprotective growth factors. Collectively, this accounts for variability in presentation and response of DR to conventional therapy. Fortunately, there are straightforward recommendations for addressing these issues and supporting traditional treatment plans. We have reviewed the literature for nutritional interventions that support conventional therapies to reduce disease risk and severity. Optimal combinations of vitamins B1, B2, B6, L-methylfolate, methylcobalamin (B12), C, D, natural vitamin E complex, lutein, zeaxanthin, alpha-lipoic acid, and n-acetylcysteine are identified for protecting the retina and choroid. Certain medical foods have been successfully used as therapy for retinopathy. Recommendations based on this review and our clinical experience are developed for clinicians to use to support conventional therapy for DR.

My current level of hardware/software doesn’t represent the diabetes community well but It’s thankfully becoming more common. It uses a pump and CGM wirelessly connected together with an algorithm that resides on my phone. It’s the do-it-yourself open source system known as Loop.
The training I received over the years has been spotty and my best lessons were self-taught during periods of high motivation, especially when faced with a secondary complication. I did attend a week-long training session put on by a university diabetes clinic and that was helpful. Most of what was presented there, however, reinforced things I previously learned reading books by John Walsh and Gary Scheiner.
I suspect that only patients motivated to learn on their own are confident and competent enough to make changes to correction factors and basal rates. I find it amusing when the form I fill out at my quarterly endo visits asks if I’ve made any changes to my insulin program since my last visit 90 days ago. I always smile and think to myself, “Of course I’ve made changes to my insulin regimen; I live with type 1 diabetes!”
It’s a rare week that goes by that I haven’t made some insulin delivery changes. The only constant in diabetes management is its dynamic nature. A “set-it-and-forget-it” attitude is an anachronism that never served patients well. A diabetes patient who doesn’t own his/her diabetes is one who doesn’t do well or enjoys uncommon luck.

Some of you may recall that I posted in May 2011 that I was having trouble with what seemed like Thyroid problems, fatigue, low body temperature and problems recovering from exercise. I still have these problems and they seem to be getting worse and I need some help on how to goose my medical team into action on this. At this point, all I get is head scratching, here take this pill for symptoms and ""it must not be serious if you are still alive.""I had a whole bunch of tests done which seemed to rule out the simple things like Hashimotos and basic primary and secondary hypothyroidism and in October I was found to have Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). So I spent the next six months trying to get effectively treated for the OSA and finally I have a machine which has gotten me to the point where I only wake 7-8 times/hour. The sleep doctor feels that is the best we can achieve and has now prescribed a ""stimulant"" to address my fatigue.But I think this may be a big mistake. My basic symptoms are unchanged but my blood sugar is out of whack, particularly my Darn Phenomenon and my insulin requirements are up 25%.  I think I may have some sort of adrenal problem already and a stimulant may be the last thing I need.Here are the basics of my test results.

 My body temperature is highly variable, between 93 and 95 deg F in the morning and on average 95 deg during the day, but it has swung as high as 97 deg F.  I have checked my temperature daily (sometimes multiple times) with three different thermometers over more than a year.  These are actually my temperatures and they have been confirmed on doctor visits.My vitamin D is fine, I have regularly had it tested and I supplement.So I could use your help in how to engage my endo in trying to track this down. I have an endo visit in two weeks.  What test results should I ask for? Should I press for certain treatments? Should I see another specialist? Should I press for X-Rays or ultrasounds of my ""glands?"" ",Aug '12

I have not monitored my temperatures like you did but I am always on the lower side. As a desk worker I have down-regulated my metabolism too. But I still think it is related to the Thyroid but like you my TSH, T3 and T4 is normal. Vitamin D can be ruled out for you and for me it did not make any difference. The following might be helpful but I am not convinced. For the following orchestration to go wrong it needs neurological problems on a more severe scale in my opinion:The hypothalamus gland, located at the base of the brain, controls internal body temperature. This gland responds to sensory signals from temperature receptors in the skin and deep inside the body. The hypothalamus establishes a ""set point"" for the internal body temperature, then constantly compares this with its own actual temperature. If the two temperatures do not match, the hypothalamus activates temperature-decreasing or temperature-increasing procedures until the temperatures are equalized.Sources: Guyton, Arthur C. Textbook of Medical Physiology, 8th ed., p. 802; Selkurt, Ewald E. ogy, 5th ed., p. 169.The following conditions should be considered too:-Raynauds phenomenon http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raynaud%27s_phenomenon 61-Wilson’s Temperature Syndrome http://www.wilsonssyndrome.com/ 48-Addison’s disease http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/endocrine_and_metabolic_di... 53",Aug '12

There may well be something with my hypothalmus or pituatary, I just don't know how to test and diagnose for it. My endo has queued up an IGF and GH test, but I don't know what they would say.I doubt it is Raynaud's, that generally affects blood flow and temperature regulation in the extemeties.And I sorta ruled out Addison's. From your link:Addison's disease is an insidious, usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex. It causes various symptoms, including hypotension and hyperpigmentation, and can lead to adrenal crisis with cardiovascular collapse. Diagnosis is clinical and by finding elevated plasma ACTH with low plasma cortisol. Treatment depends on the cause but generally includes hydrocortisone and sometimes other hormones.I have hypertension and no hyperpigmentation and I seem to have elevated cortisol. And the other results don't seem to match, I have normal electrolytes and I am not hypoglycemic. Still it is worth asking the doctor.And the whole Wilson's Temperature Syndrome. Oh boy. The American Thyroid 1Association has denounced it and I don't want to argue about an unrecognized condition. But in either case, I do have a low T3 and low body temperature.

Although my brother's bg level has been normal thus far, I have read that there is a link between Type 2 diabetes and low testosterone.My brother's doc did an MRI of the pituitary when his bloodwork showed low testosterone to check for some kind of pituitary tumor that could cause this but he didn't find anything -- I've talked to a couple of other men who have been through this process and I think the MRI is one of the screening steps for diagnosis.I don't know if it's realted in any way, but my brother was also diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and has the machine also. When he went to the sleep lab, they woke him up and put the mask on him before the night was over because it was so bad.I really empathize with you. The hardest part sometimes is finding the right doctor to make the connection. My brother still hasn't completely diagnosed his issues.

Your Fe staturation, iron & ferritin are low.Sufficient cortisol is needed for cells to utilize T3. The cortisol test you had isn't an effective measure of adrenal function. A saliva cortisol test is needed. It tests cortisol four times a day. Cortisol levels change during the day.

3889,About the Mental and Emotional Wellness category,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,jewels,,"Where to begin.  I’ve been diabetic for 26 years.  I live in rural PA.  There is only one endo within a 40 mile radius.  When I first started with this guy 11 years ago, it was just him and another endo in the office.  I really liked him and he was new to the area and took time with you.
Since then, the other guy left and it was him for quite a while.  They were burning
him out and I could see a change.
Now they have slowly hired 3 physicians assistants and nurse practitioners.  I have not seen the doctor in years.
I am frustrated because they never seem to be able to keep the same staff.  They have installed a new computer system and so everyone walks around with their computers.
They pressed me hard to go to medtronic for a pump when animus went under with pumps.
They were unable to download my pump at my last appt and so asked me to call the company.
I called and I would send information 30 pages at a time with pump, meter and cgm reports.  Actually I would hand deliver reports.  I would then get phone calls wanting more information.  MORE INFO?!?!?!?!?!  What the heck?    Now I admit I am not always the most patient patient.  lol  Anyway, This one practitioner came to this office from the diabetes and nutrition center.  I met with her and ordered a new pump and stated that it could be ordered in a week.  That is when my pump expired.
I left town for a family wedding and 6 weeks later I returned home.  I waited patiently for a call or something about my new pump.
I went into the diabetes and nutrition center and asked what was going on?  The receptionist looked and found all of my paper work stashed away in a file cabinet.  Nothing had been done with it since my appt.
When she came to my docs office I told them I didn’t want to work with her.  I explained my reasons.
Still trying to be a better patient, I drop off more “info”.  Another phone call needing more information.  All this coming from this Cristy.
The docs office got yet another new receptionist and I swear, no matter what I say she never smiles.
Well, after a stressful vacation in which I had to evacuate due to hurricane Florence.  Another message on my phone asking me to call.  This coming the day after I returned a call to the nurse.
What now?  Of course every time you call they have no clue and have to look you up on the computer and read the notes to see why you were called.
Now I am frustrated because I feel like my care has gone downhill.  So focused on the computer these days and then like a robot reading the information they have to read you about eating the same thing at the same time every day, the things that can  happen, blah blah blah.
I have again simply become numbers on a piece of paper.  No longer a patient who tries to be strong even though in the back of my mind I’m terrified.  I’m physically and emotionally stressed with all the things I have to keep track of.  This is only with diabetes.  There this thing called life as well.
So, I blew a gasket.  I totally lost it and unfortunately it was this nurses second day I think.  I did apologize etc…
We have also been having problems with our phone here at the house and a few other stresses.
Anyway, over the weekend, I receive a letter from the office state they couldn’t reach me and that my appointment has been changed.  So instead of meeting with the nurse practitioner as I have been for a couple of years now, I am meeting with the doctor.
I called and they arent really communicating much with me.  Just that I need to see the doctor and I asked if I could see one of the other practitioners I was told that it was up to the doctor that I needed to see him.
So now I am sick to my stomach and in a panic.  Is he going to drop me?
I called the insurance company and discovered that He is the only endo within a 40 mile radius and that if I see someone else further away, it will be considered out of network.
I don’t see him until the 13 of November.  How do I not freak out until then?  I am terrified of doctors.  All doctors.
Always have been.  Anyway.  I guess I’m asking people if this type of thing has ever happened to them?  Like have you ever felt so frustrated with the system that you just lost it?

Do NOT get the shorter briefer volume as it is 28 cents more expensive and less than half the size and misses out most of the important aspects including how a newly diagnosed person can attempt to look into ways of reversing diabetes.You would need a third book to get the free shipping. I have bought 3 editions of Bernstein's main book in the past 11 years and I bought the diet book and wish I had not, as it was a waste of money after having the big book. He keeps adding to his main book. Don't try to read an outdated version. Only get edition 4. Don't get the Diabetes Diet book by the same man as it is too simplistic and misses out on so much from his larger book which will take a long time to read and will be a reference. The shorter version is even more expensive by 28 cents. If you are not a reader, still get the bigger book, hands down. The Bernstein group here on Tudiabetes is worth reading going back a few years. Don't only read current contributions.Have you had any metals put into your dental work? That caused my diabetes within one year. I had a gold-copper crown put on when I was 23 and within a year I was diabetic. I had NO virus. I was an active person who did not eat a lot. It took many years to become disturbed about diabetes. It even went away for almost a year, called a honeymoon phase. I bought a bike and walked a lot and rode, and often was not needing insulin.What I didn't do and should have done was turn to eating lots of vegetables. Chances are you may not do that either as it can be that cooking is too complex for some people, especially men and when they move away from home they may eat whatever is easy. I have a BF who does not eat veggies and he can easily be caught with a high blood sugar level.Still do all you can to reverse diabetes as the longer you take insulin the more diabetic you become. It is not a black and white thing. If you are still producing a lot of insulin, then do all you can to make that insulin work better by taking chromium. B vitamins also mean less insulin is needed. If you drink alcohol and avoid red meat fed on grass which is just about all these days, you could be low on Bvits. Food is not just a matter of calories, but nutrients are crucial.I was told in 1986 by my current endocrinologist that someone put on insulin who is T1 will be totally dependent within 5 years and he told me that when I was already at 5 years and I was FAR from totally dependent so I did even more researching into supplements, which is the best tactic going. I lived across the street from a health store, thank God!!!! Prior to that all I did was walk and bike. I hardly cooked as I lived alone. That was before the Internet which I had help from only 11 years later.So do all you can to minimize the exhaustion of your ability to make insulin. You do not go from OK to nothing overnight. One of the worst approaches of doctors is to ignore giving the push to eating vegetables as they are not nutritionists and people FAIL miserably at taking advice to eat better.They send you to a dietician and it seems most people will ignore even what they suggest.This is not an issue of a diet to lose weight. Even a full cup of chopped broccoli a day is not enough chromium as it would be 1/3 of the RDA yet it is one of the better sources, but it also depends on the soil it is grown in.",Feb '14

3896,Resilience,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Terry4,9,"As a person who has lived long-term with diabetes, I see the ability to bounce back from adversity as critical to my success with diabetes management. Resilience is crucial to any long-term project and human happiness.
Yet resilience can never emerge without adversity. For us, diabetes has supplied that adversity, often more than we’d like.
Since I live alone, I now spend long periods unpunctuated with regular human face-to-face contact. I rely on long phone calls and a few zoom calls  to mitigate my aloneness. It’s not ideal but reality can force us to adjust and wise adjustments define resilience.
I feel buoyed by two ongoing worldwide events as I hide from this pandemic: a SpaceX mission and Vendee Globe, a single-handed around-the-world sailboat race.
SpaceX just launched a crew of astronauts to the International Space Station a few days ago. That crew deliberately chose to name their space capsule, Resilience. In interviews the crew acknowledged the broader social context of pandemic, political disagreement, and racial justice as motivation for their choice of naming their mission.
In a press conference featuring the five astronauts this morning, their common acknowledgment of their respect for science seems poignant to me. It makes a whole lot of sense in this setting. Respect for science forms the basis for their immediate survival.
Science also provides the basis for our survival in this pandemic. While many things remain unknown about our future in the next year or two, I confidently see the product of science, a vaccine, will be our common lifeline. Even our crude tools to manage our time without a vaccine, widespread mask-wearing, keeping physical distance, and washing our hands all give a respectful nod to scientific reality.
The Vendee Globe sailboat race starts and ends in France and will take place over the next three months, starting just over one week ago. Single-handing a sailboat all the way around the world, particularly its course through the Southern Ocean, is built on resilience. The sailors, both men and women, all must be resilient as they must rely on their personal resources, both mental and physical, to complete this grueling challenge.
The last 37 years of my life since a T1D diagnosis, is built on the foundation of many scientific achievements: the discovery of insulin and the technology to produce it, blood glucose test strips and the meters to read them, insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors, and automated insulin dosing systems.
I realize that resilience goes well beyond the scope of science but I find the interplay between science and human resilience an inspiring one.",Nov '20

I have been crying like a baby all day. All resilience is gone.
I spent 8 hours on the phone today and 8 hours on the phone yesterday just trying to get someone, anyone, to process this DMV form. Before this, there have been months of effort.
All they have to do is process 1 form. But, they can’t or wont. So, I have to spend months of relentless effort. They tell me I have to go to the legislature and change laws in order to make it not be this way anymore. I am only 1 person and I cannot keep making up for all the failures of so many other people and entire systems. They almost brought me to my knees this year.
Finally, at the end of business day, some nurse found one of the many, many forms I had submitted and promised that they would call me tomorrow.
This is only half of the battle. Now, I have to get the government to process the form.
I just can’t keep this up. The obstacles are insurmountable.
They might as well be asking me to fly to the moon. I cannot do it. I feel so disabled today. I will never be able to do anything. I will never be able to work or take care of myself if I this is what I have to do, just to drive a car. I am without hope.

3910,How do you sustain long-term motivation against Covid-19?,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Terry4,7,"As I write this, I’ve read many recent reports of a worrying rise in Covid-19 infections all around the world. We’ve been at this project for many months now. Many of us radically changed our social interactions motivated by the reasonable fear we felt about the virus driving this pandemic.
In the Northern Hemisphere we enter the dark winter months, a time when viruses find ideal environments for transmission: holiday parties, heated low-humidity conditions, and minimal ventilation. The siren song of cultural customs and tradition entice us to relax our vigilance. “It’ll just be this one-time; I’ve otherwise been disciplined and deserve this social respite,” we rationalize.
I’ve read many accounts reasoning that depriving ourselves of our usual social interaction is bad for our mental and emotional health. I feel this persuasive tug yet always come to the overwhelming conclusion that life and death risks legitimately over-ride my mental and emotional health status.
Besides, there are tactics that can mitigate the damage to our social lives. While they may not be as satisfying as face-to-face human interaction that we crave, phone calls, Zoom meetings, and written communication can help us safely survive.
All of us here share diabetes as a life-long health burden. We all understand the long-term challenge of diabetes. It is a marathon, not a sprint. In that way we have all been forced to create skills that can sustain us over the long run. I’ve found this to help me keep my eye on the prize when it comes to Covid-19.
The recent news of promising vaccines does indicate that we may be nearing better times. I think we will find that things will get better for us in 2021. The first quarter should see vaccine deployment in the front-line health care workers while the second quarter may very well witness vaccines for the vulnerable population of which we are a part. Of course, uncertainty remains high and we all need to calibrate our hopes against reality.
I’m an introvert, so I know the social concessions I’ve made are easier for me than it is for extroverts. I’ve found phone conversations with my close family can sustain my mental and emotional health in a reasonable balance. I’ve paid attention to my nutrition and exercise routines as well.
I have made deliberate and considered concessions to increased risks of several in-person medical appointments: cataract surgeries, dental visits, and a few blood draws. Except for the dental appointments, all parties were wearing masks. I also visit the grocery store about once per week but do so during off-hours with a targeted list that minimizes my time in the store. My grocery store now has complete compliance with mask-wearing, a condition not present last spring.
I believe that I’ve been able to balance the added risk and keep it to a reasonable level. This is not something that we can measure but simply a judgment that we each can make.
How do you feel you’ve been managing the long-term nature of surviving Covid-19? Have you compromised with your social preferences, especially with the usual holiday celebrations. I declined an in-person holiday meal invitation from my adult daughter; she understood and only raised the topic to solicit my position.
I think we’re getting closer to the end of the challenge and I encourage everyone to not lose sight of the real goal - surviving to a better day. I fear the decimating action of Covid-19 in the next 90 days or so. We should not let our guard down now! The end of this pandemic is in sight.",Nov '20
3911,How do you sustain long-term motivation against Covid-19?,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,JamesIgoe,4,"Maybe this why I work as a software developer, but I am engaged by things on my computers, so sites I regularly go through, plus things to take care of, and since it was always this way, it hasn’t changed as much for me as it has for people that are highly social. Once everything is done, and I wrap up, I usually spend time with my spouse, in a routine, having dinner, watching obscure foreign quiz shows and Swedish noir, as the consistency can help reduce anxiety.
Also, I’ve long been fitness-oriented, so the rowing machine I bought for the pandemic helps, as does living in a condo with a park and playground, where I can take pleasant walks and play basketball. Also, at least once a week I take mini-hikes around Manhattan, from 5 to 7 miles, through the distinct neighborhoods.
My wife is more social than I am, although more introverted, and she arranges a couple of Zooms with friends that I attend, and she then also attends numerous online meetings for The New York Society for Ethical Culture she is part with her mother. Nicely, the pandemic has made her more tolerant and less impatient.
As for my health, I lost weight initially, and now back to my usual, but my health hasn’t suffered at all, and in fact, is better, as I mostly take care of myself, my environment is very controlled, doctors do the prescribing, and little has changed. That said, I do have a few minor issues that I will see someone for, slowly advancing Dupuytren’s contracture and mild RA in the other hand.
The things I no longer have and have no realistic replacement:

Weekly dinner out with family
Cultural events, like Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall
Museums, the biggest loss for me, and although I can attend a few easily, like The Met Museum and MoMa, I have not yet
Time at the gym, the long hikes, and the museums were often combined into outings done on one day over weekends, making the other just a workout day, so that has been disruptive, but in truth, although I miss them, I am happy regardless

The upsides:

Time spent in training courses, and although work-related, gratifying
Better diet and A1c

I shared this on LinkedIn recently just after Pfizer announced it prelim results:
Even with a vaccine, there are still going to be months of physical isolation, and this provides some ideas to get through, like routine, optimism, micro-goals, and more…

Thank you for your thoughts. I’ll add a bit of my own perspective:
What do I miss the most: opera and travel … and the social elements of each.
I try to remind myself every day how lucky I am during this pandemic.
In particular, as a retiree I can easily limit my daily interactions. Plus, suddenly “fixed income” is like Nirvana … whereas a year ago it was almost cause for pity.
The dog and I go for 3 nice, long walks per day totaling 8-12 miles in a low density area with little traffic. On most of those walks, I’m no closer than 30-50 feet from of other people … but have my mask on the entire time. The dog is in charge of route that frees me to think or just enjoy being outdoors.
I’ve got a brother and a close friend that are on oxygen if they are not sitting down. I’m thankful that I’m not in an equally precarious situation.
While grocery shopping is probably the scariest thing I have to do, I find that takeout meals are a great comfort. Far better than I can prepare for myself, virtually zero contact for me or, equally important, the much higher risk restaurant staff. Plus, I know that I’m helping a small business stay afloat during these challenging times.
I do keep an eye on Covid data at the county, State, US, and world level and every few days download some data to look at a few things for myself. It helps me to better deal with much of the (politically motivated) noise out there.
I keep planning travel, even though it may have to be cancelled. For me, having something to look forward to is more beneficial than the disappointment if it has to be cancelled.
Enough from me …
Stay safe!

3914,How do you sustain long-term motivation against Covid-19?,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Marilyn6,5,"I realize that I have been extreme in my desire to protect myself from Covid, and because of this my husband has been extreme in his efforts to protect me.
We have some things going for us which makes this effort easier. We are both introverts, we are retired, we live in two beautiful locations, and we have each other and don’t usually drive each other crazy.
After having type 1 for 61 yrs, and doing my best most of the time to stay healthy, I am not about to let Covid take me out. My health has stayed the same with all these months at home. My weight has stayed the same and I still ride my exercise bike for an hour a day. I stay on my low fat vegan diet. I even have some good news. I don’t go to the doctor, dentist, or even get labs done while isolated. I know what my A1c will be because it seldom changes much, so I don’t need a lab for those results.  CJ114 helped me figure out how to order a cholesterol tester from China, so I can test my lipid levels at home.  I have stents so it is important that my LDL levels stay as low as I can get them. I can’t take statins or the newer injections due to severe side effects. In a last ditch effort my cardiologist suggested I take a supplement he had heard about which might lower my LDL 10%. I am thrilled to share that my LDL level dropped from 114 down to 47. My husband tested his cholesterol too and his was quite close to his lab results from March 2020. I realize that we aren’t sure if LDL levels are important, but I have probably seen 7 or 8 cardiologists in the last 10 yrs, and they all think it is.
I must say that I am feeling the pull of the holidays. Our son lives 1/2 hr away and we message daily and video chat now and then. We have seen him about 3 times from a distance.

Clean up and rearrange, remove the clutter the has accumulated more than usual. I find this cathartic.


Buff up one’s online presence for work, since time is now less personal and wholly remote, I’ve started taking online courses that result in badges and certifications. I’ve always enjoyed learning, but I’ve come to feel that it isn’t appreciated unless visible to others, hence the focus on a tangible result. This could also be an effect of the medical environment I work in, with a focus on certifications and degrees, as opposed to finance


Improve one’s social interactions online, so sharing and responding better to others.


Although we now spend much less, without travel, dinners out, work lunches, and clothing, I have spent a bit more on making my computer space nicer, where I spend 12 hours a day. I have more equipment than most people, and it can become cluttered, so I’ve recently purchased a few items to neaten as well as beautify, a shelf for the back of my iMac to hide equipment, a high-end mouse, Rocketbooks that are erasable and reusable to replace my paper notebooks, as well as added a computer graphics tablet. The latter is both personal and for work.


That said, since I am nearing retirement, I do think about how I will transition, and contributing via mentoring, education, and coaching might be part of that, but may be more important now, to get out of one’s little self-oriented bubble.",Nov '20
3922,How do you sustain long-term motivation against Covid-19?,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Sally7,7,"Wow, @Terry4, this is a tough one. And I am coming at from a very different view point.
I am one of those who is going to work everyday. And yes, I a very thankfully I continue to have a weekly paycheck and health insurance. I also am not sitting at home staring at the walls. I go to work everyday and do my 8 hours.
It has been a very long 9 months. And I have seen first hand how people’s mind set has changed. At first, everyone was in panic mode. Everyone was very concerned and willing to do what the health professionals were saying. As crazy as it was early on, people were concerned.
Now, people are tired and they don’t care anymore. I am in a state that masks are mandatory when out in public and whenever I doors. But it is amazing how many people don’t wear them correctly or at all. No one understands what 6 feet looks like. I am running away from people all the time at work. So many just keep getting closer and closer, and as I back up and away, they keep coming closer. Can’t tell you how many times, I have to beg people to backup and I can help them find what they need. But wow, I feel like I have gotten this far with all the protocols my employer has put into effect and as we get closer to a vaccine, I might not make it due to people complaining how tired they are.
I am so tired. I miss going out to eat with family and friends.I miss having friends over. I miss going to the zoo, wild animal park, seaworld, museums in the park. I miss a lot. But I have made it 50 years with my diabetes and I don’t want a virus to take me out.
So, I spend my off days at home. Playing with the dogs, walking the dogs, reading books, watching tv, sewing masks for myself and family and friends, scrapbooking, gardening. There are things I usually do and I still do. It’s just a lot more quiet.
I am just hoping and praying that people understand that we have to keep at this. It will get much worse if we don’t stay at this. I had the hardest conversation with my daughter and her boyfriend who were were going to have over for Thanksgiving dinner outside on the patio. I had to tell her she couldn’t come over because they made the decision to go to Mexico this weekend. I can’t take that kind of risk. Thankfully she understands our thought process but I am amazed that they made that decision. My son, who lives with us still because he couldn’t transfer to a 4 year university due to everything being virtual. He lives with 2 older parents, both with pre existing conditions, and he works with seniors has not seen his friend in person since March. It has been painful.
Can we get through this? I think we can! I think those of us who deal with a chronic condition can handle anything thrown at them. We got this! I just keep plugging along! And pray everyday that people will get it to help save our healthcare workers. If we think we are tired, just think about what they are doing everyday without the support they need. We had a nursing shortage before this and now with so many getting sick and being physically and mentally exhausted!

I agree that the mood of the general population has morphed from concern, panic, and preparation last spring to one of fatigue with all things Covid. I sense that that fatigue is generally more prevalent in the younger and less vulnerable groups, a sad reality that I don’t know how to deal with.
I acknowledge, however, that many members of my age cohort have decided that they just don’t care about public health measure surrounding Covid-19.
I think that the less vulnerable groups might think that people like me, older with significant comorbidities, are over-reacting to things. I guess that difference of opinion comes down to just how vulnerable each group feels about this threat.

3930,"Rumination, a mindless route to unhappiness",Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Terry4,2,"One definition of rumination that I found:

The process of continuously thinking about the same thoughts, which tend to be sad or dark,  is  called  rumination . A habit of  rumination can be dangerous to your mental health, as it can prolong or intensify depression as well as impair your ability to think and process emotions.

I realize that this bad habit is not limited to people with diabetes but I think it makes our challenge with diabetes even more difficult. I wish I was aware of this self-defeating behavior when I was much younger and traversing a particularly rough patch involving divorce and betrayal compounded with engaging in a losing legal battle to prevent my young child’s move far away from me. I lost 10 years of my life dominated by this bad way of thinking.
I am a person with strong cognitive skills and find this ability especially useful in many aspects of my life. Unfortunately, it also makes me susceptible to replaying events over and over with no off-ramp. It could be called analysis paralysis. I wish I had better emotional intelligence during that time as I seemed intent on learning things the hard way.
I did slowly learn some tactics that helped but wished I had been more focussed on treating this insidious habit with persistent antidotes. What are those antidotes?
One of the best tactics for me was communicating my perceived troubles with a caring listener, both friends and professionals. I think however, that one tactic is not enough to counteract this bad habit. A fabric of interwoven tactics works better.
I found that writing, as in a journal, an effective technique. The saying, “onto paper, off of your mind,” describes breaking this vicious circle.
I discovered that physical exercise could distract me from my problems, but again, it was not enough to neutralize my self-defeating behavior.
One thing that didn’t work was a belief that all I needed was some transforming cathartic event that would, once and for all, relieve me of this ineffective and painful thought process. In divorce situations, I think that this illogical conclusion traps many into making premature romantic relationships likely doomed to failure. I was lucky enough to avoid this particular trap.
In the last few years, I’ve adopted a meditation habit that I think would have been a potent tactic to break the rumination trap. It’s effective but not a quick fix, however.
Anyway, you get the idea. Do you observe this self-defeating behavior in yourself? What immediate tactics work for you to break this cycle and what things have you adopted in the long-run to defeat rumination?",Nov '20

3932,Mood Swings,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,JamesIgoe,1,"First, welcome.
Second, it’s hard to guess what is going on without more details, so some thoughts, likely terrible, but I’m willing to try…


Sure, not eating makes moods worse. Here, I’m thinking of court judgments that get progressively worse up until lunch, and once fed, judges are nicer. On the flip side, low blood sugar leads to weakness and dizziness, so for me a disinclination to fight, although I have seen anger associated with high blood sugar.


My spouse used to repeatedly ask me if I had checked my blood sugar, part of her anxious disposition. My mother, after my father died, under a lot of pressure, repeatedly attacked me, and it went on for years, giving me an attitude of ‘leave me alone’. With my spouse, once I decided to just test when she asked, she behaved better, my A1c got better, and over time I was able to lessen her inappropriate requests, taking time to educate her about the correct and/or suggested timing.


I don’t know your relationship, so pardon if this is way off base, but depending on how you verbally approach your partner, it might set him off, if it put him in a position where he felt weak, triggering defensiveness. or in my case if he came from a family where he was often attacked. Attempts at sympathy or concern can easily backfire unless you know that he is fine otherwise.


Question, how is his control? That could be another reason, in that he doesn’t to discuss something that he is doing terrible with, but again, I have no idea of his health or your situation.


Is he open about being Type 1 or is it something he hides, is tight-lipped about? Asking about it could run counter to how he wants to present it to the rest of the world.

I would just lovingly hand him a treat - something he likes to eat, like halloween candy or some delicious cheese and cracker plate that has been lovingly prepared. Call it an appetizer. If his blood sugar is low, he will be hungry and he will prob eat it.
One idea - you could make him a mini screwdriver - full of orange juice, with just a tiny bit (like an airline bottle) of vodka in it. I had a boyfriend who used to do this to me in college. It worked like a charm. It should be in a small glass, so it doesn’t make his sugar high, like an old fashioned breakfast orange juice glass.

My wonderful husband married me knowing full well what life would and could be like. I had been doing diabetes on my own for over 10 years when we meet and just celebrated my 50th year. He has been through it all with me. And early on, the lows were super hard on him. This was before CGM and pumps. For the longest time, I thought I hated him when I would yell and scream at him during my lows. Finally when I was seeking help with my depression, my therapist suggested my husband come to a session. So we all talked for an hour and my husband finally got the answer he needed from a professional not me. She told him that anything happening during a low was just my brain not firing correctly because it was screaming for glucose to stay alive. No brain functions correctly without glucose. She told him that my rages during my lows were not because I hated him. And she asked if I behaved the same with our children and he stopped and thought and said yes. So he knew how much I (we) love our children so it had to be no glucose causing the mood swings.
Of course my CGM has helped stop those scary lows. They are almost completely gone now. And while I still don’t share a lot about my day to day care, he does have a pretty good understanding of diabetes.
A CGM is a great place to start. I did find getting my blood sugars into a better spot ( not great at first but better) I mentally felt better. Less swings in blood sugars. Up and down blood sugars are physically and mentally exhausting.
And maybe finding a mental specialist who has knowledge of diabetes or chronic conditions might help. I was very fortunate to have an organization in town who deals with diabetes and the mental side of it. Good luck and have a talk with him about what he needs from you and what you need from him.

Over the years, I’ve been on more types of insulin than I can count and at least four or five different insulin pumps. I also have insulin resistance, so I’m on metformin as well as insulin.
But lately, I’m just tired. Emotionally tired.
I’m tired of always fighting my blood sugar, of always fighting my insulin resistance. I’m tired of waking up in the middle of the night because my pump is alarming over something (highs, lows, sensor read issues, etc. etc.).
I’m tired. The day-to-day frustrations of diabetes have gotten to where some days I just sit there and fume whenever my insulin pump beeps at me for basically anything at all. And at least once or twice a month, diabetes and my fights with it will reduce me to tears. Because I’m just so sick of fighting this thing.
I’m emotionally worn out.
My Endocrinologist doesn’t really respond when I try to talk about how tired I am of this. I mean, that’s not his area of expertise and I get it. I’m scheduled to consult with a psychiatrist next month over possible ADHD, and I plan to bring this up with him as well, because I think it’s getting worse.

We should all do the best we can as much of the time as we can. If your feeling burnt out you should of course talk to people about it. (Friends/Family/Doctors). Hopefully this isn’t controversial but you could also relax how tightly you control your diabetes for a little while until your feeling better. Nothing crazy but maybe allow your self a little wider variance to reduce the constant monitoring/action required for management.
For me there are certain things I can do that make me feel less diabetic and for a short time I feel more normal. I go on really long bike rides. I like it because I get to drink gatorade and never need to carry insulin with me. I just have sugar tabets if I need them.

Gatoraid
Water
Glucose tablets

I’ve never had a pump but I think for me having to carry “supplies” is part of what gets old. Maybe switching to MDI for a little while would be a nice change? Not having to have the pump and supplies with you might be a nice change of pace? I’ve never had a pump so I don’t know what its like to have one for good/bad.

I believe it helps psychologically,  I have been able to bring my numbers back down to below 7.0 and have kept it down for 4 months.  I still hate taking all the meds, and monitoring carbs, and the insulin shots, and testing everyday, but I’d like to think this group of people have cared enough about me to give me good advice and the strength to carry on.

I didn’t really figure this out until 2012. Since then, my diabetes life has been better, not perfect but better.

But, here’s the thing: having Type 1 means many of us are also susceptible to other autoimmune disorders. Disorders affecting thyroid and the CNS often result in fatigue and depression as symptoms. I was raised as a “backwoods tough guy” and taught quite explicitly to never admit to fear, depression, or having feelings in general and to downplay things like physical and emotional stress or pain.
I’ve kind of run out of patience with that approach to life, though, and I’m talking to a doctor about antidepressants this week. I know that’s slightly off topic, but it might be useful to somebody.

I tend to follow this course to maintain my motivation. I like to try new things even if I’m not experiencing the worst. I think it makes me think I’m in control and I set the course. Of course that’s not completely true because so many things about T1 are outside our control, no matter what. But it keeps me motivated. I like to be first in line to try new products and I get proactive about addressing problems I’m experiencing without waiting for my doctor to suggest something (of course I clear anything I try with him first to make sure it’s safe). In fact I just called Tandem this morning to get samples of different infusion sets in hopes of improving my batting average on avoiding sites with poor absorption.

I have been a type 1 for 60 yrs but didn’t recognize that a part of the fatigue I am feeling now is being caused by the sometimes grueling work it takes to keep on top of this disease.
I am used to being in control of my diabetes partly because I have had it for so darn long and partly because I have become disciplined.
To me it just is what it is and I handle it. That is until it starts giving me grief and then it throws me for a loop and it seems like such a burden. I don’t think that I handle the emotional fatigue especially well, but I do get through it.
I think reading your post reminded me to not be so darn hard on myself. It reminded me that I am a warrior and to congratulate myself on making it this far. It reminded me that there are others who know exactly what I am going through and how hard I have to work to keep healthy. You reminded me that I am not alone.
Keep reminding yourself that you aren’t alone and that you will feel better.
Right now because of what I hope is an infection my glucose levels are going wild and instead of being very controlled I am seeing some really high and very low numbers within a matter of hours even though I am eating my normal diet. It is extremely frustrating and unnerving.
I just have to remind myself that this too shall pass and excellent control will come back. In the long run this will not hurt me. Eventually I will get a good night’s sleep without alerts going off.
I deal with my diabetes because I have too. I don’t have a choice. Usually I am quite happy that it isn’t anything worse. At 68 I have outlived some of my friends who ended up with more devastating diseases.
It sometimes takes someone with diabetes or someone who lives with a loved one who Is insulin dependent to really understand how much of ourselves we have to give to this disease every moment of our lives. It is a very, very difficult road that we are on and it isn’t fair.  Life still can be very good though.

I was seeing a psychologist focused on type diabetes for about 6 months and she really helped me a lot with perfectionism, doing CBT and exposure type therapy to certain foods I wouldn´t allow myself to eat and then I had a bit of a setback and stopped going to her because I didn´t want to listen to her talking logically and I just wanted to do some disorderd eating.
Luckily, her voice stayed in my head for months and I have been eating much better and healthily these last two months. The biggest hurdle was the stop of all record keeping of blood sugar, exercise and food consumption. I am much more relaxed about everything, but this has always come and go over the years, and I am afraid I am going to fall back into old habits, as recently, those same intrusive thought keep popping into my head-I am not hungry enough, I am not restricting enough, the exercise I am doing is not vigorous enough, and something bad is going to happen. The “what” is unclear. I am not thinking of long-term complications.
I would love to start training for a virtual half-marathon, especially because of all of this covid just canceling everything-being in my home country for holidays, seeing family, getting back to the office (working from home til at least April 2021), Christmas,etc.  However, training for sth like a half marathon means I would have to start keeping track of km run and a lot of my food intake before and during runs, as knowing how food affects my blood sugar, especially for long runs.
I really miss running races and having fitness goals. For now, I dont use any fitness apps, I save nothing in my Garmin, I dont know how many km I run, I keep no Excel spreadsheets. Sometimes if I am really stressing, I will work out twice a day and have a minimum time to exercise and feel guilty and horrible if I don´t do the workouts.
Should I wait longer to try doing this? I have been “normal” since mid-August. I go out to eat with friends and I am not exercising like a crazy person. I reread the above and that is how I WAS, not how I am NOW. I just don´t want to be that way again.",Oct '20

Sometimes, just try to remember, things don’t have to be perfect. It just doesn’t have to be just so. I have really good control and I snorkel.

Try not to worry, and focus on what to do now rather than past choices.  Most of those studies really should not be used for blame.  Diabetes has hereditary nature too.
Advice…  learn what works for you.  Get a BG meter and start testing before and after meals to see how YOU respond to foods and portion sizes.  Read labels and focus on carbs rather than calories for correlation to how much your BG rises after meal.  Log this and review with doctor, as that will help with deciding your treatment.

Its always about making more informed choices, and not being fearful of one thing or another without context or practical alternatives.)

Gramps had his test strips to pee onto and 2 shots of long acting insulin every 12 hours and that’s all he had. Yet, despite this, all of them lived into their 80’s. Now they did die from heart attacks. All of them died from massive heart attacks. I don’t know if having better tools to fight the Diabetes would have made a difference, but I think it would have. Also, they did not have good treatments for heart attacks back then. They all died in the early 80’s. But they lived a long time and with much poorer BG control than we have today.",May '20

Some things will be frustrating as you learn to adapt. Give your self time and space to adjust. Lower your commitments and responsibilities, to the degree that you can, in order to make room for adjustment while you figure things out. You will develop new skills you didn’t know that you had. You will become a different, more sophisticated person than you might otherwise have been. Embrace it. Its gonna be fine. But, its gonna take some work. You can do it. You will feel better once you figure it out. Make space in your life to take care of your physical body and your soul. That will make a big difference in the long run.

3988,Is it possible to have a successful life with diabetes?,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,JamesIgoe,1,"Wow. That’s a thought, and there are so many possible responses.
Honestly, by the time we are adults, we are left with this sense that outcomes are purely dependent on our actions. They aren’t. So much of our life is dictated by our circumstances, happenstance, and luck. I am lucky to have as few complications as I do, but I certainly did nothing consciously that gave me Type 1 diabetes, and some of the best actions I’ve taken for my diabetes had nothing to do with the illness and were in trying to deal with other situations.


I weighed 175 pounds on a 6’4"" frame, worked out 5 times a week, and ate an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet when I started developing hypertension in my late 20’s. Certainly not an outcome that I expected. The positive thing that I have done is take my medication, work out, and watch my weight, and have done so for the past 30 years.


Mentally, I decided early that my life was likely going to be shorter and that I would likely die of a heart attack since, besides the effect of TYpe 1 diabetes, it runs in my family. Almost no one in my family dies of cancer. That said, biting the bullet, knowing that life was going to be tougher, has been a good outlook for me. I made so many positive choices to avoid the potential negatives.


Like yourself, I’ve recently developed neuropathy in my feet, nothing extreme, tingling and a minor loss of sensation in one foot, One of the contributors to that is my height. normally not a bad thing, but a likely contributor in my case, exacerbated by my tendency to really pound my feet on long hikes through Manhattan.


A former, highly-respected endocrinologist of mine wisely mentioned to me, when I was putting the blame on myself for variations in my control, that diabetes management is a lot less science than I realized. In essence, we try, but there are always variations, things beyond our control.

3989,Is it possible to have a successful life with diabetes?,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,JamesIgoe,3,"Being of bit a devil’s advocate, you’ve just been handed the worst and best news of your life. Someone has told you a truth, or at least something negative. Would it be any different if you weren’t told? Life would simply go on, but now with this news you can make positive choices, and in fact, you can decide to have a successful, or at least, more successful life.
Success, for me in this case, depends on what you do with that information. Blaming yourself won’t help you succeed or manage this situation. It might be important to understand how you got to this state or stage in life. Sure, some of this was based on bad choices, but not ThinkThin bars, and some of those choice come from the people around you, the world you live in. Much of this is just genetics, the proliferation of fast food, TV, and advertising, your families’ habits, and your friends’ habits.
In fact, the choice you make now can only make your life better. If you don’t adopt better habits, the diabetes only gets worse, and the only positive is happiness from ‘ignorance is bliss’.


Diet: Find enjoyable and healthy ways to eat.


Fitness - Decide to become a fitness buff, whatever ‘floats your boat’, and if you are smart, find ways that enhance your social and mental well-being. Fitness is good for everything.


Medications - If you need to take medication, you do, since they can enhance your life, as well as prolong it.


You might already do all of this, but if you don’t, making your life better is succeeding. Not choosing a better life is failure.",May '20
3990,Fear of needles/ inserting new infusion set/ sensor,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,SarahK2,1,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been diagnosed (DM1) for over 13 years and am over 30 years old, yet I still sometimes cannot deal with all the needles in my life.  I am usually ok with my pump infusion sets- I have to change them every 3 days so it’s often, and I have a spring-loaded inserter device for it which helps me insert quickly and properly.  I just got a Dexcom CGM in August, and inserting a new sensor brings up every ounce of anxiety in my body.  As I type this, I have a new sensor set stuck to my leg, but have not yet been able to plunge the needle into my skin so I could take everything off and attach the transmitter.  I’ve been trying to get myself to do it for over half an hour.
Does anyone else experience this?  I’m not as used to the Dexcom and the needles are bigger than with my other stuff, so it’s logical that it’s more “scary,” but I’m really sick of wasting so much time on stupid anxiety.  I’ve neglected to insert a new sensor for a few days in between a couple of times, just because I didn’t have the time to waste.  That means I’m not utilizing this technology that I’ve wanted for a long time to help me control my numbers.
I go to therapy and have not brought this up yet – I’m even considering finding a hypnotherapist!  I’ve had a fear of needles forever (ex: I never get a flu shot because I don’t want to deal with it), so it makes dealing with diabetes that much tougher.
Thanks for reading this long post - I look forward to everyone’s responses!",Oct '16
3991,Fear of needles/ inserting new infusion set/ sensor,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Terry4,,I’m sorry you have to deal with this fear. It’s like Fate has a cruel sense of humor! Hypnotism and talk therapy sound like good lines of inquiry. I’ve never had this fear so its hard for me to know what it feels like. It is a direct impediment for you to take care of what needs to be done to live. Good luck. I hope you find some way to deal with this!,Oct '16
3992,Fear of needles/ inserting new infusion set/ sensor,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,MM1,,"I don’t have this issue with Dexcom, but had some of this when using the Medtronic CGMS.  What worked for me was to just count, 1-2-3 GO ! (or 3-2-1 Go !) Or start with 10 or whatever works for you.

I think I can count the number of times it’s actually hurt on my fingers, yet I am nervous every time.  I also avoid flu shots both because of the needle and the bad skin reaction I have every time.  Blood tests are, well, interesting - I have to warn the phlebotomist that I have been known to be faint after the blood draw…
I can’t tell you HOW to overcome the fear – for me, it’s a matter of being more afraid of the consequences of NOT taking care of diabetes to the best of my ability.  I really want to live a healthy life, so some things just have to be endured – though, as you know, the fear does not go away with time/experience.",Oct '16

I fortunately am totally cool with blood draws (although I’ve had a few weird ones) since it’s just a tiny pinch.  This Dexcom needle is just so big and overwhelming!  I think it’s also knowing that if I screw it up, there goes a week’s “supply” of sensor, and also it takes a few hours to realize it didn’t go in properly.  The fact that the very first one I did wasn’t inserted properly and I had to remove it after trying to get it to connect for several hours is likely another culprit for my fear of doing it wrong and going through my overreaction for naught.
When I was first diagnosed I’d sometimes sit there for 2 hours trying to do my bedtime shot of Lantus.  That may have to do with Lantus stinging and then making my whole body hurt all day more than just the needle fear though ",Oct '16

I think my biggest motivation for leaving sensors in more than one week is because I fear the - mostly painless- insertions.  Sure, the second and usually third weeks work better, but my biggest motivation is the insertion.
My first shot was Levemir, and my doctor gave me the shots and told me to take it the next day on my own.  I needed a lot of coaching - from friends online - to get through that first injection.  First time I took a shot in my arm, I did NOT feel it AT ALL – and 10 seconds later, I was heading to the floor!  Oops.",Oct '16

None of us naturally like stabbing ourselves.  Most of us lose our fear and anxiety of needles simply because we do it many times.  But if it still remains this is probably something you could be really successful treating with a good therapist.  There is a form of therapy called exposure therapy 8 that is used to treat anxiety.  But you can still have ongoing fears or anxiety that may be rooted in specific incidents and situations in your past. Through exploring that and overcoming that you can likely deal with this.  Please talk to your therapist about this.

4004,Fear of needles/ inserting new infusion set/ sensor,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,MM1,1,"I did use EMLA, which is a prescription cream, but it was not for my sensors. I used it prior to chemo treatments for the port site. I put it on just prior to leaving my house, so it would have been closer to an hour by the time the IV was poked into my port.  And they always cleaned the site first.
So I agree with Maria, regarding the wait.
AE13 mentioned alternative, which I believe is not Rx, since I saw it on Amazon. I think the AZ product contains only one of the 2 ingredients in EMLA, but may be just as effective.

4005,Fear of needles/ inserting new infusion set/ sensor,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Christina16,2,"The first time I  started with the Dexcom G5 I was determined that I was going to do it myself as I was learning to take control of my D and figured it was all part and parcel of taking ownership. Here’s what really happened…
I attached the Dexcom to my abdomen and held my finger on the plunger trying to work up my nerves but after 5 minutes realized I needed more motivation. So I  spent the next hour or so watching youtube videos of others inserting the Dexcom. After awhile I thought I could do it and spent the next five minutes with my finger on the plunger. Couldn’t make myself do it so I watched the Dexcom training videos again. Tried to get myself to push the plunger again but no go. I then decided that I would just grab a heavy  book and smack the darned plunger in. I chickened out with that too. During all of this my anxiety was skyrocketing and tears were shed. Finally, my husband who had been checking on me periodically, had had enough. He handed me tissues to dry my tears and as I was wiping them with the tissues he just reached over and did it for me. 
Since May and have yet to hit the plunger on the needle myself and that’s okay. I’m entitled to feel the way I feel and I am blessed to have a supportive  spouse who’s willing to help out. I feel a little less anxious each time and do think that I will eventually work up my courage as it really doesn’t hurt…more like a quick sting. I  guess it just knowing its coming.  Admittedly I am hoping that the auto insertor comes out quickly.  ",Oct '16

I was terrified of needles and have white coat syndrome - Doctor fear, medical facility stress, and too much love carbs. My parents did xIV drugs in front of us growing up and my mom died of cancer after years of doctors when When I was 27 and she was 45. I found out the T1D when I was 44. For years before I have had my husband and friends come with me for doctors appointments and shots and blood draws, to literally hold my hand. I have passed out in the phlebotomist chair and would run if they lifted the arm across my lap. After I sobbed about the diagnosis I decided if I got this it is better than getting something else and I will just have to deal. My grandmother always said God doesn’t give you more than you can handle. It wasn’t and isn’t easy. For the first couple weeks I teared/cried with every shot. My husband is a nurse practitioner but I wouldn’t let him give shots, just information. My assistant (who had experience due to her mom) would sit with me and count to help. Then I saw some YouTube videos of children with T1D giving shots and using CGMs and cArrying and explaining diabetic supplies in school. There was a 3year old that told their omnipod to “be brave” when she helped inject it with insulin with and then Herself when injected and that made me fall apart. Now I tell myself to be brave, take some deep breaths, and keep up that mantra as needed. I remind myself that if little kiddos have to deal with this, I can! It is not easy, ever, but I do it.

No-Visitor Policies Are Bad Medicine
John L. Marshall, MD
August 24, 2020
Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape’s Coronavirus Resource Center.
This transcript has been edited for clarity.
This is John Marshall for Medscape. I’ve been thinking a lot about the impact of COVID-19 on our division, our patients, our processes, and our cancer care.
Cancer care is not elective; it has to keep going. One of the worst policies for our patients right now is this no-visitor policy. You are coming for a treatment, a clinic visit, or, worse yet, admitted to the hospital for end-of-life care or for some complex medical procedure related to your cancer, and yet you can’t have a caregiver, an advocate, sitting next to you in your room.
As much as we say they may irritate us, we all rely on them. They don’t irritate us. They help quarterback and navigate us as we see our patients. They help us coordinate care and they help us understand what that patient’s life is really like. Sure, technology bridges that to some degree, but it’s just not the same. We all know that.
As a consequence, I think the quality of our care is falling a bit because no caregivers are around. I’ve been watching patients make really interesting decisions. Nowadays it’s not uncommon for somebody to say, “I’m not going to go to the hospital to see what is wrong. I’m going to sit at home. I don’t want to go in there and be lonely, even if it means my life will be shorter. I’m not going to take another round of fourth-line therapy for metastatic disease because I don’t want to risk ending up in a hospital by myself, particularly at end of life.” [I think we are doing] hospice sooner rather than trying to extend people’s lives with some intervention or “Band-Aid.”
Because of the terribleness of being by yourself in the hospital — maybe the loneliest place on Earth — patients are making different medical decisions.
I also wonder how much of this is going to stick around when we loosen up. In Washington, DC, we have started to do some elective procedures and fill back up within the hospital. Maybe soon we will start to allow visitors and caregivers physically back into the hospital. I wonder if we will slip back to where we were before or if we will reflect on this and incorporate more heavily the importance of being at home with family.
This loneliest place on Earth that we have created in our hospitals is teaching us all a lesson for the future. Just a thought as COVID-19 continues to wreck our days. John Marshall for WebMD/Medscape.

4023,So distraught,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Terry4,3,"I am surprised about my missing even casual social connections like brief encounters at the coffee shop or grocery store. I am an introvert and can get by without much social contact so this realization does surprise me.
I’ve had to cancel two travel tours to Europe this year and miss the social opportunities that they represent. I also miss the face to face contact I would normally enjoy with my adult daughter. I moved to her city four years ago in order to enjoy more contact with her. I miss that contact.
We do text and use FaceTime but I find they’re qualitatively less satisfying than in-person meetings. In person conversational cues provide a richer context for me. The multi-person Zoom meetings I’ve engaged in with my siblings seem stilted and shallow. I usually just stay quiet in those encounters even when there’s something I’d like to add as entering the conversation seems awkward and follow-up is minimal as the group just skips from one brief topic to another. I much prefer the one-on-one old-fashioned telephone conversation.

4026,So distraught,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Cinderfella,2,I miss visiting with my sister.  I have only seen her one time since January.  We sat outside in her yard about ten feet apart.  It was better than not seeing her at all.,Sep '20
4027,So distraught,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Jonny_Quest,8,"Before COVID I became a teleworker because my work hours were reduced and then I was laid off due to a company merger. I found another job within a month but the work load never translated to a 40 hr work week. At best 8-21 hours per week. Because commuting in Chicagoland is pricey I transitioned teleworking. It is very isolating when your only human contact is via Skype & email. At 55 there are only so many part time jobs I can find. So my income was in the toilet but not my expenses.
So just before the pandemic hit I enrolled in a truck driving school. But before I completed it the school was shut down because of covid. I was able to go to a neighboring state to complete training and now my husband and I are on the road together. To stay healthy we do as much as we can on truck and limit our exposure to fuel stops, groceries, laundry & showers. We have a camp toilet on truck and I cook healthy meals at home to take on truck. We supplement it with occasional trips to Aldi.
My parents died in 2014 & 2016. We chose to remove my mom from a nursing home in 2014 because her care was subpar. We had a team effort to take care of my mom. I am so glad we removed her. If she had lived the nursing home she was in has had the highest covid infection rates in the city. She would likely not have survived it. Not acceptable.
Because of my work history I’ve not had the funds to visit my family that lives in TN, TX & VA. My sisters and I text daily. But we know not seeing each is a small sacrifice that will keep us healthy. My sister has experienced the birth of her first grandchild and she has not seen her and likely will not see her for a long time. Another sister’s husband was hospitalized for a non-COVID related illness and she refused to leave his side and made sure he and all others were properly kitted out in PPE and his room adequately cleaned. When in doubt she had her supply of items to do that.
But even though I move thru different states on a daily basis I very rarely interact with people and only in a mask and with lots of sanitizer. I don’t share pens and when required to do so at a pickup or delivery I follow their in house rules regarding covid.
My experience and life is still very uncertain but I’ve been able to hold on to my house and our cars are paid for. We are still eating well because I cook everything from scratch and I’d stored things in freezer because of my earlier job load.
BUT I HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING ON THE BRIGHT SIDE & realize that even though I am isolated in terms of work and activities it gives me an opportunity to try things that fit into this new paradigm. If I didn’t do this I would have to give in to madness and for me that’s not an option.

4030,Need to vent about this endo,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,daisy707,12,"Today was a rough day. I need to vent because I feel like no one around me understands. This will be long winded, and if I repeat myself I apologize. I’m wiped out from today, so my brain is asleep.
I saw a new endo today (I usually just rely on my primary doctor because I have great control and have for years), because I was newly diagnosed with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis. I wanted to get more thyroid tests done if possible because I wasn’t put on any meds, despite feeling horrible.
The endo is putting in for an ultrasound of my thyroid and getting the same tests that I just had done again to monitor and checking my Vitamin D levels. But in this appointment, I just felt shamed and like I was doing horrible as a T1D even though I KNOW I’m not.
My primary doc did an A1C 3 months ago, it was 5.6. I haven’t had an A1C over 7 in the 8 years I’ve been diabetic, and I’ve been sticking around 6 for a very long time. I’m on MDI and just have a glucose meter, test 8-10 times a day if not more, I keep a blood sugar log and write everything down, and I don’t have extreme highs and lows like I used to right after diagnosis, after I switched to a new long acting insulin.
Today in the endo’s office they did a new A1C, it was 5.7. He uploaded all of my meter’s numbers and printed them out. I’ve had more lows recently (around 70) because it’s hot out, and I always trend lower in hotter months. I was told that I should never have lows. He also told me that I should never correct a high after meals, and only ever take insulin when I eat. He kept going on and on about how my numbers weren’t steady and that they should be a straight line. He said it’s always better to be high than low because a low can kill you. (duh, but so can’t highs??)
I have only ever had 3 times in my entire T1D journey where I’ve been super low (two times in the 30s, once in the 20s) and that was early on. I rarely ever drop below 65 now, and I often catch it before it gets there, but I was told I should never have lows, and that “it’s healthier to be a steady 185 all day long than have a low, because a low rebounds into a high”, which I don’t agree with because I always rebound to a healthy around 100 number. I used to over-treat my lows early on, but I know how many carbs I need now. I only ever over treat if I know I’m going to be really active or I’m out in public and don’t want to drop again.
He asked me general questions, like where I work, etc. I am a homemaker right now, planning to have children. I also have a Bachelor’s Degree in Healthcare Administration. Because I told him this information he said to me “You’re doing good, but you could be doing better considering your circumstances” and I asked him to explain. He said because I don’t work (I do work, I take care of our home, finances, outdoor tasks, etc) and because I have a knowledge of health care, that my control should be better.
Guys, I know not all endos are like this, but I DO NOT UNDERSTAND why they feel the need to act like perfection is possible!! I am a diabetic, why treat me as though my numbers should mimic a non-diabetic?
I went to him just to get more info on my thyroid to make sure it was safe to try to conceive, that’s all. And now I just feel stressed and like a pile of poo. I know I shouldn’t let one doctor get under my skin, because they don’t know my control, and what affects my blood sugars, etc. like I do, but it just upset me. I feel like I want a strong support system of doctors if I’m going to start trying to get pregnant, but if I’m expected to be perfect then I don’t know if I can deal.
This endo was so consumed by diet and the times I eat being the only thing affecting my numbers that I just wanted to scream. Also, the not correcting highs after a meal made me angry. Sometimes, as all of us, I can go up to 200 after a meal and I’m not just going to let it sit there! If I know I’m stacking insulin, I’ll take a smaller dose to get it to normal range without going low, which I do all the time. My lows lately haven’t been the result of too much insulin alone, and my highs (very few of them) haven’t been rebound highs.
It just astounds me why these doctors exist. I’m going through with getting the ultrasound done, and the labs done, but I don’t think I’m going back. I’m talking with my primary doc tomorrow to see if she’s comfortable monitoring my diabetes during pregnancy, and if so I’m sticking with her.
I’m just upset that he had my in his office for two hours, telling me non sense about stuff I already knew, and has a clear disregard for what T1D is really like. I don’t have a CGM, as my insurance won’t cover, but he’s pushing me to get one because he thinks it would make my control better. I’m happy with my control though, and if I can’t afford one, I can’t afford one. I’m open to one during pregnancy but I also want to make sure I know how to manage without one, which I do.
This is long, and I’m sorry for anyone who doesn’t care. I just am irritated, and was hoping for a good experience, but this is the exact reason why I haven’t seen an endo in 7 years. I can’t find one willing to listen to me, especially in my small area.",Aug '20

Thank you for the nudge of confidence lol I told myself going in, to take advice with a grain of salt, but I think because it was going on for two hours, it just got to me. I wanted to make sure I got my thyroid tests ordered so I didn’t say too much, but when he told me to never eat potatoes or corn because it will give me high blood sugar (eye roll) I told him that every BODY is different and that I eat them all the time with no problem. It just makes me sad for those who can’t easily walk away or know how to stand up for themselves. It can be disheartening when you think you might have good luck with a new doc. I’m not aiming my blood sugar higher just to please a doctor who won’t have to live with my body and what comes of it. Heck no to that!
And I am open to a Dex, but if insurance won’t cover it then I’m not going to worry myself over one. I have limited finances for diabetes extras, so as long as I can manage comfortably, I won’t focus on not having the things that aren’t absolutely necessary for me.

I feel uncomfortable most of the time in that range and would not intentionally  let it run there if I can get it down. Your body is getting damage for sure at that level for any length of time.
I think you would love the dexcom, even if you still need some finger sticks here and there. For me it is off a lot frequently so I don’t dose or treat on dex without recent finger sticks.  For instance today it has already been wrong several times by 50 points or so, it is usually right about the trends.

4050,Addressing the emotional side of diabetes with Dr. Bill Polonksy,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,MilaStaff,8,"WRITTEN BY: Todd Boudreaux
Dr. Bill Polonsky is an Associate Clinical Professor in Medicine at the University of California San Diego, and the President and Co-Founder of the Behavioral Diabetes Institute 3. He received his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Yale University and has served as a Senior Psychologist at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and Chairman of the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators. Dr. Polonsky was one of four featured experts during Beyond Type 1’s #KnowledgeDrop Series, discussing the effect of Type 1 diabetes on mental health.
How did you get involved in diabetes and mental health? What is your background?
I’m what’s called a clinical health psychologist. I actually did much of my training up the road at UCSF. And through happenstance, I ended up going for an interview at the [Joslin] Diabetes Center in Boston. We started chatting about possibilities that perhaps I could work there… They weren’t quite sure but we kind of hit it off and they said, “Why don’t you come work here for six months and let’s just find out what happens?”
What was it like having not previously worked in the diabetes space?
I still remember my first day of work in 1988 because I had no idea what to do. I didn’t know anything about diabetes. I had read a little bit and seen a couple of people with diabetes but didn’t know anything. So I started walking around the waiting room and introducing myself to people, saying, “Hey, could you tell me what’s living with diabetes like for you?”
And the most remarkable thing happened — The very first person I asked this looked at me and said, “Thank you — no one’s ever asked me that question before.” I thought, “Well, that’s pretty messed up.”
So I just loved what I did and was really just honored how many people were willing to share their stories with me. And we realized there’s a lot of pain out there, there’s a lot of discomforts, there’s a lot of people really struggling. And so that’s what I’ve been doing ever since. I just feel fortunate and lucky and have loved it every single day.
It’s 2019, and I still don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question like that…
No, it is unfortunately still too rare.
Can you talk about the founding of the Behavioral Diabetes Institute?
I moved to San Diego in 1993. 10 years later, I met Dr. Susan Guzman, who had begun working in this field as well. And we wondered because there was no such thing as the Joslin Diabetes Center in San Diego or any major diabetes center there, how could we bring together all the different things that we were doing and wanted to do — whether it’s training healthcare professionals, seeing folks who are having a tough time, doing research, trying to create a living laboratory — to understand better what’s going on and then create interventions that can make a real difference.
And the Behavioral Diabetes Institute is the result. We say with great pride, and great sadness, that our institute remains, as far as we know, the world’s only nonprofit wholly dedicated to addressing the unmet emotional needs of people with diabetes. The only one? That’s just crazy.
What is it exactly that you’re doing at the BDI?
Well, things have changed over the course of time as we’ve tried to survive as a nonprofit.
For many years was we did a lot of structured group programs. We called our primary program, “Getting on track with your diabetes” – for people who were having a hard time. Just bringing people together for weekend programs or longer-term programs, helping them to realize that if they are not taking perfect care of their diabetes that they are not bad people, then problem-solving ways to help them feel more successful with their diabetes management without feeling burdened by it. And now, thanks to our collaboration with our friends here at UC San Francisco, we’ve been formalizing all of that work in randomized controlled studies to try and document how programs like these are truly useful (or not), and that work is continuing to this day. We continue to devise and offer other kinds of structured group programs to help folks who are struggling with diabetes, but we do less of that than we used to.
We continue to do more and more research, trying to better understand the behavioral and emotional side of diabetes – both looking at what interventions work as well as to better understand what the critical emotional issues really are. We have completed a number of studies looking at diabetes distress, worries and fears regarding hypoglycemia, and much more. One further example: We’ve just completed a project looking at Dexcom Share – to explore how people with diabetes and their loved ones are using Share, and whether it is useful or not useful.
For many years we had a lot of fun developing print materials, but that has mostly gone away. We just don’t have any financial support for them anymore. That’s when we started developing the thing that BDI is probably the most well-known for: our diabetes etiquette cards 13. We developed these because we were doing all these group programs for people who said they were being driven crazy by all the annoying and obnoxious things other people were doing. We said, well, you know, you just can’t punch these people. What do you do? Wouldn’t it be great if you could just politely say to your obnoxious uncle, “Oh, you must not know the rules about how to behave appropriately,” and hand them a diabetes etiquette card. They’re funny, but they’re bringing up important points, and the goal is to make it a way of having it be a conversation starter.
We have also begun to do a lot more training for healthcare providers because we realized if there’s only going to be one [BDI] how do we make a difference in a bigger way? How do we help other health care providers to be more successful with their patients? We teach them some of the fundamental methods for appreciating and addressing the emotional side of diabetes, and we are constantly pointing out that you can only be of help to your patient if you work hard to make certain that you and your patient  are on the same side .
And are the healthcare providers endocrinologists and primary care physicians that you’re training?
It’s everybody. Nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, social workers, other mental health professionals, everybody.
Can you tell me about any research currently underway, or past research you’ve done that really stands out in your mind?
From a research perspective, probably what we are most well-known for is the work we have done on diabetes burnout and diabetes distress. It was about asking, “How do we develop a questionnaire about diabetes distress, and have that be a conversation starter for healthcare professionals and their patients, but also make that better understood as an important and common phenomenon that is deserving of attention by people with diabetes and their healthcare providers?”
Our research suggests that diabetes distress may be more important, or at least more common, than depression. And that a lot of the previous work and research about depression and diabetes might be not quite right. Often what looks like depression might really be diabetes distress – that what is really bugging people is just feeling overwhelmed and out of control with their diabetes.
When someone’s “numbers” improve, do their levels of diabetes distress go down?
Sometime yes, but sometimes no.
So a person with a relatively healthy A1C of 6% can still experience the same distress as someone whose A1C is 9%?
Oh yes! But they may be distressed about different things. They can still feel like a failure. They can still be struggling with personal issues around diabetes. They can still be frightened to death about hypoglycemia. They could be struggling around food.
And depression is not uncommon. But many people still think if you have someone who’s  very depressed and in poor glycemic control, then if we could just fix their depression, their diabetes will get better. And if the person is quite depressed, it is vital that we treat their depression, but this doesn’t typically lead to better glucose control. Overcoming depression just may not be enough. We need to also help people to regain a sense of hope that they can do well, to have confidence that they can success, and to regain a sense of power and control over their diabetes. But then you may have to do more, like help them to gain the tools and knowledge they need to be successful – perhaps to become loopers, for example – or help them to find a new physician who treats them with kindness and respect .
Has the influx of technology led to more diabetes distress? Less? Do you think it has helped or harmed the emotional health of those living with T1D?
I believe that Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) has the potential to be the most wonderful thing that’s happened to people with Type 1 diabetes since 1922. Does getting a CGM make people feel better? Well, we actually had done several studies on this and the answer is, at least to some degree, yes. We’ve published several studies showing that people’s scores on the diabetes distress scale 5 often improve when you can help them to get started on CGM. Of course, this isn’t true for everyone. Diabetes technology has been, and will continue to be, a source of stress for many people with diabetes and their loved ones; much of this has to do with one’s expectations for that technology and with the type of training and support that is being offered. As advances in CGM technology and training continue, I expect that the positive impact on emotional health (especially on alleviating diabetes distress) will grow and grow.",Jan '20

This is what makes diabetes tough to manage. We know we can’t ignore diabetes yet we also know that letting it dominate our lives can sap the joy and meaning we seek.
For me, I try to use technology that does comprise a burden but will make life easier once habits engrain them into my routine. As we know, it’s all about balance. Recently, I turned off my high and low alarms on my CGM and I’m just living with the mandatory 55 (3) alarm. My carb-limited time-bound way of eating usually keeps me within my old alarm limits while I don’t feel compelled to respond to these alarms. For the time being, this is the balance I strike.",Jan '20

I have had the t.slimx2 for 5 months, and added the Dex g6 to the Tandem Basal IQ almost 3 months ago. I was quite satisfied with my previous A1c of 6 to 6.4%. I have the feeling my A1c will be quite a bit higher at my next CDE visit end of February. I have been adjusting everything in my Profile… basal rates, i:c ratios, sensitivity factor and duration of insulin activity. It is a slow process driven by the CGM information and all the alarms.

 Mila:

So I started walking around the waiting room and introducing myself to people, saying, “Hey, could you tell me what’s living with diabetes like for you?”
And the most remarkable thing happened — The very first person I asked this looked at me and said, “Thank you — no one’s ever asked me that question before.” I thought, “Well, that’s pretty messed up.”


40+ years with T1D and no provider has ever asked me such a respectful question.
Dr. Polonsky gets it.   He somehow sees the causes of distress from dealing with T1D in a clear light.
I am happy to read that he is working to teach healthcare providers that ""you can only be of help to your patient if you work hard to make certain that you and your patient are on the same side.

So much of our emotional health depends on things mostly outside our control: swinging blood sugar levels, our jobs, and the daily commute are just a few things not easily changed.
I’ve learned, however, that I can choose to do some simple things that influence my outlook and emotions in a positive way, out-of-proportion with the effort and time needed to do them.
I live in a four-season climate that features a lot of wet and cold winter weather. Sunshine during winter is a rare commodity and something most people miss. I know that there is a connection between exposure to the sun and a sense of well-being.
Just the other day, a typical wet and dreary winter one, I was walking down the city street and suddenly the sun came out, bright and glorious. I stopped walking and stood up against the side of a building facing south, lifted my face toward the sun, closed my eyes and luxuriated in the warm sunshine. I enjoyed the bright orange color that the sun makes through my eyelids and just stood there for about five minutes to drink in this primal pleasure.
It was such a simple thing to do, didn’t cost anything, and took little time. I’ve since found two more chances to repeat this bit of sun-worship. I think it connects deeply with my human DNA in a restorative and healing way.  This may seem frivolous and non-essential to some but it did brighten my day and boost my spirits even though the rain and clouds soon returned.

Anyway, I finally made myself read some Ram Dass this afternoon  and that immediately helped.

Sometimes The Female is home while this is going on.  In that case, it will often happen that at some stage I will walk over to her with some form of the coffee and tell her to recite the blessing for its aroma.

 The_Senator_From_Glu:

My struggle is finding some way to unlock a person’s motivation to pay attention to their health in the midst of so much struggle, hopelessness, boredom and malaise.


That is a big job, a frustrating one, I’m sure. I find it hard to wrap my head around understanding why a person will continue down a path of poor health habits simply because they don’t want to change their ways, even if they understand that their personal status quo is clearly heading them toward pain and disability.
A peer support group like TuD can be a potent tool to change lives but it doesn’t work for everyone every time. This forum and some of the people who participated in it 7-10 years ago sparked my motivation to improve my diabetes health. I realize that most of the responsibility to improve was mine.
I wish I could easily replicate what I’ve been able to do but I don’t know how. I tell my story, express my opinions, and try to diplomatically share the success I’ve enjoyed. It bothers me that posting celebratory statistics discourages people even when I’ve offered them as inspiration. It’s a double edge sword and I don’t know how to make that aspect work better.
What really baffles me is when people read about what I’ve done and they see my case as exceptional, something that they could never do. I try to post about my personal challenges to let people know that my health is not perfect. I live with some significant health deficits including coronary artery disease and I’m sure my long-term diabetes has contributed to it. But I don’t give up.
Finding personal motivation is a different puzzle for each of us. Hope is crucial, without it, not much can be done. I’ve always been attracted to projects that feature a new way of doing something, a new way of thinking about things, especially if there’s an establishment that doubts the value of a system that makes sense to me.
Dr. Bernstein and low-carb eating to treat diabetes, confronted by the traditional medical skepticism that doubts its value, is perfectly suited to fire up my motivation. But that’s me, not everyone is built that way.
You have a hard job and you likely just need to persist and take pleasure in the occasional success. If you turn around one or two people’s life and health, that is worthwhile.",Jan '20

 BlueDelilah:

My BG is out of range


If that’s the case, and your CGM alerts are confirmed by a fingerstick, the next step would be to try to adjust your overnight basal rate on your pump to see if you can’t get your BG more stabilized. Your carb intake at dinner time might be a factor as well. Generally the lower the carbs, the easier it is to manage. I find overnight BG is the hardest because you’re not awake to check on things until your alarm goes off, so even though theoretically I can have those french fries or piece of pie if I bolus for it correctly, in practice it makes things a lot simpler if I don’t. But the main thing is to try to see what the pattern is, eliminate as many variables as you can, and adjust your basal rate accordingly. Often more easily said than done, of course. ",Feb '16

So? It would seem you need to try to take some steps to get your BG to stay in your target range more consistently. Especially overnight when you need to sleep. Perhaps?

I insert the Enlite, strictly according to the procedure in the instructions, except for the site selection. I can’t keep the darned thing in my abdomen so I put it in either my backside, or upper arm.

At the time, when my Endo was suggesting pumps, I was travelling a lot, for business, in the US, Canada and overseas. Often, I would be in quite remote locations so I asked how would I handle a pump failure in such a location. The answers always defaulted to “oh, you need to carry an emergency supply of pens/ syringes etc etc…”, so I figured that a CGM would be ok as it is a support type device, and I could live without it if it failed. The Dr, screwed up and prescribed a pump so, when it arrived, I noticed that it had the CGM function and I just left the little red plastic plug in the insulin vial port; and it’s been there ever since.
Since then, I have sailed about 13,000 nautical miles, including ocean crossings, and am still alive. I also found the Walmart Glucose meter to be a great tool. simple, but functional, and cheap to operate. I am not so decrepit that I can’t input the readings into the CGM so it all works quite well.

An Aha! moment
Have you ever found some interesting info online and had it open the door to a whole new world? This video (there are many sources online on this issue) provide me with a Aha! moment - a flash of insight into my personal health history that I had not seen before.
I knew that mindfulness is often mentioned as a component of good health. My daily searches for information to educate me about my health often lead to YouTube videos. The title of this video by Sally Gray caught my eye: How to Heal the Vagus Nerve to Heal Your Mind & Body. The reason it drew my attention is that I live with gastroparesis, an impairment of the vagus nerve, the nerve that connects the brain to digestives organs like the stomach, liver, and intestines.
How to Heal the ""Vagus Nerve"" to Heal Your Mind & Body
I am definitely a type A personality. When I was a young adult, I was consumed with ambition to find and develop a career that provided not only sustenance but also long term happiness. I am goal-oriented and have been successful at many of life’s pursuits.
Sympathetic nervous system dominance
But, there’s a dark side to this daily striving to succeed that only now, at the late age of 65, that I’m starting to appreciate. We, as people with diabetes, recognize that balance and equilibrium are key concepts for good blood glucose management, especially when treating with insulin.
Life contains countless examples of opposing forces. There’s the ebb and flow of ocean tides, the rhythm of day and night, and the fundamental human respiration that includes breathing in and breathing out.
Yet I have lived most of my life inhaling and failing to successfully exhale. When I was 16, I was diagnosed with an ulcer in my duodenum, the transitional small intestine just below the stomach. I was a serious teenager struggling with many of the issues teenagers must endure, but looking back, I can see that my seriousness damaged my health. That diagnosis was a real mystery to me and I am only now starting to make some sense of what happened.
Furthermore, I think that my type 1 diabetes diagnosis 14 years later likely flowed from the same source. Now I know that auto-immunity triggers type 1 diabetes but what sets the stage for that to occur?
Nervous system yin and yang
I was aware of the duality of the central nervous system comprised of the sympathetic and parasympathetic components. The sympathetic nervous system is essential to our survival; its fight or flight response enables us to martial immediate body resources like an increased heart rate and blood pressure to deal with extrinsic threats.
Our bodies, however, were not designed to run continuously on the sympathetic side. It’s unhealthy, unsustainable, and promotes disease. In order to maintain a healthy equilibrium, we need to spend enough time using the parasympathetic nervous system to relax and restore our full body.
We often see references in many health news sources about the emerging science of the gut microbiome and the mind-body connection. My gastroparesis dysbiosis shows me how important a healthy brain-gut axis is for overall physical and emotional health.
A little late, but a better path
I feel like I’ve finally realized the nature and importance of nurturing the parasympathetic nervous system. I’m discovering tactics like breathing exercises that promote good vagal tone. My essential belief is that the human body contains an impressive ability to heal itself. I’m hoping that adoption of these new habits can mitigate some of the damage I’ve caused myself by living my almost entire life using the sympathetic nervous system to the point of burnout and disease. I’m hoping it’s not too late to turn things around.

I am fortunate to have a personality that feels stress easily (often in the form of worry) and, depending on the circumstances, will naturally back off if I feel my comfort zone being exceeded too much.
One thing I do disagree with (that your post seems to speak of) is that I don’t believe we have any direct control over the conditions we develop. We can do everything in our power to be healthy and still have a health condition develop. And many things that were attributed to stress in the past have, in more recent years, been shown to have other causes. For example, ulcers used to be attributed to stress, but in the 1980s they found that they’re actually caused by an H. pylori infection (which 50% of humanity is infected with).
So, while I do believe stress reduction is an important part of overall health, I don’t think it (or any other specific action) can be taken to prevent any particular health condition from developing.

And there is a big reason these feelings are now really worrying you.  You are on the path to becoming an adult.  You care more about all of your peers at school, just as all of them care more about others.  This is a natural part of growing up as your peers and your identity becomes more and more important to who you are.
I’d like to offer you two suggestions.  First, many of your feelings are actually shared by many around you at school, feeling unnoticed, not liked, different.  And the overall situation may seem hopeless, but I would encourage you to accept the opposite view.  Things “will get better.”  You will be happy.  You will be successful.  Every night before you go to sleep, try to write down three things that made you proud or made you happy or just made you feel good.  If you do this it will help you focus on the good things in life and strive for them instead of simply focusing and dwelling on the bad things.
The second thing I would like to suggest is that you keep a list of the top five things you want to change.  Like dressing better or getting more or better friends.  And focus your efforts on those things as a long-term goal.  Not something you will fix tomorrow, but something that next school year you can have changed.  It is ok to enlist others in your endeavor even if they don’t fully know how or why they are helping you (like taking a friend clothes shopping).

If you are really that against talking to a professional, maybe ask your parents to help you find a support group.

One of the best things that happened for me was I went to camp for diabetic kids and found out there are other people like me. Fellow campers were my best friends for many years even though I didn’t live near any of them. Now with social media should be even easier to stay in touch. Maybe ask if your parents would consider sending you to camp. If money is an issue most camps have ‘scholarships’ to help pay for them. Or look on FB for a group of teens like yourself.

I know how incredibly hard it is to be that age, but I really can promise you that it gets better. Your teenage years are rough, and looking back I wish that I had reached out more to others for help.

Of course being 68 years old and retired can make it difficult to remember what I had for breakfast   But seriously…your comments are as true for me today as they are for you.  I have never seen anyone else pull out a pen/needle or an insulin pump at a restaurant.  “Normal people” have very little knowledge of T1D, how it is managed or its potential bad effects on us.  The tubing of the infusion set is a pain, day and night.  Melted chocolate on my fingers always shouts “Bad Diabetic”!!!  My Endo’s are still on me to improve my A1c even though I have no serious complications and other than having T1D I am in better physical and mental health than my peers.
So, do I have a secret plan that will magically help you?  Sorry, no.  I have figured out my way of keeping on an even keel and you will have to figure out yours.  Where and when and how to start???

You have received some good suggestions for next steps and an exceptional offer from rgcainmd for a potential friend and co-conspirator on how to snack well.
I suggest you talk to at least one of your parents.  They probably have sensed something is amiss and should know that it’s not being 13, it’s the T1D thing.

4162,Have you had “diabetes burnout”? Introduce yourself!,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Radical_Yellow_Duck,,"hi Jo,
Congrats on making it four decades. i can really understand about having things pile on with losing the job and the insurance. It is good that you have at least some income from the part time and odd jobs. have you checked the manufacturers of the insulin you are supposed to take for any programs that they may have?. It may take some documentation of your income and resources, but if they give you a couple of months supply for free, then that gets you over that one hurdle.
With the eyesight loss, do you now qualify for medicaid? Take a day to go talk to the local city, county, or state officials that administer social services in your area. you know it is their job to help out people, and they may be familiar with services that you are unaware of. When you were working full time you were paying your taxes. you did it not only because you had to but because you knew that part of your taxes were paying to help those in a position that they could not help themselves. It isn’t a case of accepting permanent largess, but more of a helping hand while you transition to the next job with good pay and insurance. Then you will back to paying back the system. That is why it is there.

You may disagree but patience is a super power.  When you want your BS to come down or go up – you must have patience and let your body adjust or respond and every time it is different.  When you want to explain to your husband AGAIN what you can or can’t eat and he doesn’t seem to be listening, you pray for patience to get you through.  When you start scheduling all the appointments and start juggling with your work schedule, a husband, four children and your personal life (be it what it may) it is patience that saves the day.
As I work on my healthy diet and watch for results in my BS or weight or just how I feel, it seems like the kryptonite has been brought out and the patience has become weak and without its usual powers of calm.  As I wait for my meds to come in the mail, patience takes on wings and flies out the window.

There was a time i was depressed.
Diabetes was not the only reason, I was not doing very well professionally.
With constant failure in my endeavors i started having typically depressive symptoms.
I got withdrawn socially and my health was also in constant deterioration.
The only thing which i helped me getting back to normal routine was Badminton. I understood how important is to engage socially and in any physical activity.
I am an introvert, so i try to avoid people. But with time i understood that one need some form of social interaction to have good mental health. I must confess that being socially and physically active can be a great medicine for people suffering from mental health issues.
You need to find people that are understanding and good at heart. This may be difficult to achieve but doable if you try visit different places. You can start with taking some time for hobby classes, this way you can also meet new people",Dec '19

4211,How to tell someone you’re dating,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,CB11,1,"Apologies if this isn’t the right forum for this, but I’d love some advice.
I’ve typically been very secretive about having diabetes and would hide it from people I’m dating for as long as I could get away with it. I totally get the benefits of sharing it early on, etc. but it just wasn’t something I felt comfortable with.
Once I got a dexcom, I’d usually rip it off if I felt like I was going to be in a situation where someone was going to see it. (Which wasn’t a big deal with the G5, but the G6 transmitters are 10 days so it’s worse to do it with them)
Finally, I became comfortable enough to wear it around someone I was seeing. They asked about it, I answered, and it wasn’t a big deal at all. Then the next time they saw me wearing it, they felt honored that I felt comfortable enough to wear it around them (I told them how I use to be self-conscious.) It gave me bravery for the next time.
Anyways, tonight I mentioned it to someone new I was dating. It was in context of another conversation, not at a mealtime and not a general blurt of “I have diabetes”. The reply? “Oh, that’s SERIOUS” I replied with, yeah, well, it’s not that bad since I felt like they thought I was going to die… Again, the reply “It’s serious”. I said it’s a pain, but it is what it is. Then they mentioned “well, as long as you take your medicine.”
I know everyone has different replies, but this one felt weird to me and I wasn’t sure how to handle it. It played on all my worst fears that diabetes made me less desirable and lovable since I was flawed. It could have been my imagination, but I felt like they cooled off a little after I told them. It might have been in my head.
Has anyone experienced something similar? Any tricks for telling someone new, especially if you aren’t super obvious about having diabetes in general?
I’m looking at getting a pump, which I know isn’t something I can hide the way I did by ripping off the dexcom, so I need to get better at this.
And any tips for dealing with a situation like I explained above? Or not feeling bummed by the reply?",Oct '19
4212,How to tell someone you’re dating,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Firenza,10,"This is a subject that comes up with most disabilities and I personally got over anyone knowing I had diabetes when I was toddler. It’s usually one of the first things someone will learn about me and peoples responses often affect my feelings about them. I’ve gotten every response you can imagine but the kind that annoys me the most is “oh, you poor thing”.
There is a subtle difference between empathy and pity and some people just do not know how to distinguish one from the other and some people think that as soon as they hear you have a disability that it’s their duty to tell you how you should think or take care of yourself. Those are the kind of people that usually only remain surface friends although if they themselves have some experience with my condition or have close family I am happy to discuss or even try new things that could help. Your dates response doesn’t sound too odd but if his responses were making you annoyed then there isn’t any reason you need to stick around if you can’t or don’t feel like educating them.
I think of telling someone I have diabetes as an educational opportunity since so many people have misconceptions about what it’s like to have diabetes nowadays and that if you take good care of yourself that most PWD will live as long and as healthily as their peers. I like when people ask me questions about my diabetes treatments and devices. I have one friend that regularly asks me if the insulin prices are going down yet.

Maybe he or she won’t want to get involved with you because you have diabetes. That is their loss and it is good to know that from the beginning.
If you are looking for a long term relationship I think that you need to try to become more comfortable with having diabetes yourself. It just is what it is and it is ok. It is just one small part you.
With excellent care, you can live a very long life, but it is a more complicated life that your loved one will have to be more than happy to share with you.  He or she needs
to love you for who you are diabetes and all.
Some perspective partners won’t have it in themselves to live with someone who has extra needs. It is good to know that before you get too invested in the relationship.

I’m actually using this as an opportunity to vet people who wouldn’t be good partners; if someone is turned off by me having diabetes, something I can’t control, then they aren’t the right person for me regardless. Maybe finding out this way can help save me down the road.

I can’t imagine not telling someone on the first date, but then I tell most people in my life. I find people’s reactions tend to mirror how I tell them about it. If I tell them in a very casual way (“by the way, I’m a T1 diabetic, which means I take insulin before I eat and sometimes at other times, so if you see me stabbing myself, don’t worry, I’m fine, it’s not an epi-pen ha”), most people are like oh ok, and not that many even have immediate follow-up questions. Some ask how long I’ve had it, if it’s a big deal, or other things, and I’ll tell them I’ve had it since I was a kid, it’s sort of a big deal in that I have to do things every day for it, but it’s also just a normal part of life at this point for me, and I can eat most things I want except I usually don’t drink sugary drinks or super sugary food unless I’m low. That’s usually about it—when I’m getting intimate with someone, I let them know “oh this is my Dexcom, it’s taped on securely, don’t worry if you bump it, it’s fine” and that’s also not a big thing.
Basically, my guess is that the way you are handling it, your date might be picking up that you’re acting like it’s a big deal or something to hide and then unload as you would something serious or as a potential deal-breaker. So of course they will then think it’s serious—you’re acting like it! Treat it like a matter of fact part of life, and most people will follow suit.",Oct '19

 CB11:

For those out there in new or old relationships, how does your partner view your diabetes?


It’s varied by person for me—I usually don’t fill people in on the details of what I’m doing/why unless I’m very close to them. I also have never had a partner (even my current serious partner who lives with me) follow my Dexcom, nor do I think I ever would, because to me, that feels super weird (although I know others do that and like it, whatever works for folks!). My current partner knows about handling lows, and I’m comfortable with her asking about blood sugars, which she does sometimes, especially if I’m seeming off or something. I do not involve in her dosing decisions or anything like that, although she understands that for some foods I need to “pregame” as we call it. It probably helps that we have great communication in general and that she’s a social worker, so I feel like I can talk to her not only about the diabetes stuff easily when I want to, but can also have discussions outside of the moment about how I find it helpful for her to interact with me about it (in fact, she generally welcomes that kind of information and uses it effectively). She does get concerned at times, but mostly only if I’m very low or if I’m expressing concern about an aspect of my diabetes to her. So she tends to take her cues from me.
I think as you transition from dating to being in a more significant relationship with someone, this is the kind of thing that warrants direct conversations, in terms of letting them know what you want and giving them a chance to ask questions and express any concerns. Way more effective than just hoping you end up on the same page.",Oct '19

I understand your concern.
I’m 65 and began dating again five or six years ago after my marriage ended.
Both of my long term relationships, plus the less important ones have been very understanding, concerned and helpful.
But I was having hypoglycemic events that disrupted our time together so I had to explain what was going on and what the implications for a partner could be.
As a result of their openness to learning more and their concern for me, I realized that I had to be completely open and tell them as much as they wanted to know about what was going on.
In the end, my dearest friend, was the person who did the research to discover and encourage me to use CGM.  I wasn’t all that thrilled by it but it was better than the downsides and my friend was accepting and I don’t think he cared very much that I had that little CGM sensor on my abdomen.
I still had a couple of whopper lows when the sensor wasn’t working or whatever, including one in St. Paul’s in London, but my friend stuck by me and after we talked it all through remained great about diabetes.
Eventually I ended that relationship for practical reasons, not because if diabetes but because of personal issues he had.
But he showed me that diabetes doesn’t have to be any worse in a relationship than it is our lives.
Be honest, believe in who you are and the value you bring to the world and your relationships will be better than ever.
Diabetes doesn’t define you, even it it takes more effort to manage successfully. It doesn’t diminish who you are, I think it makes you stronger and maybe a little kinder.
But you do have to be open and help your non-diabetic partner understand what it really means. If you do that, I think the good ones will be there for you.
All the best

I’m still working on self-acceptance re: diabetes. In a way, I think it’s harder because I was diagnosed at 18 so it was easier to hide if I wanted to. Now I’m realizing that hiding it is just that – it makes me feel like I’m hiding something all the time, and it’s not a good feeling.
I had dinner last night with a friend and she noticed when I went for my insulin pen at dinner, and said something like “you’re doing your thing!” It actually didn’t bother me at all; I used to think I was being slick by hiding it under the table, but now I realize my friends know and notice and don’t care at all.

Diabetes is different with everyone, as is how we deal with the challenges life presents us.

Others protect themselves and hope it will work out on its own - sounds like your parents might have been experiencing some denial. That’s really unfortunate.
I don’t know anyone personally with a similar experience - I know a couple of people who were diagnosed pre-teen/teen and were always in charge of their diabetes with little to no parent involvement. Perhaps it was bc of similar circumstances to yours.
I feel like the people I know through the online community are the hyper-interested ones and are not a large sampling of people living with diabetes. In real life, I’ve come in contact with several students with diabetes and we seem to be the outlier in care - using technology and strategies to give Caleb the best control he can have. Other students aren’t taking advantage of current technology and their care plans are much looser. In Caleb’s most recent school, there was another student with diabetes and her parents were not involved in her care and her bgs were often high. I know this from the school nurse comparing and contrasting the two methods of care and how drastic the differences are. Through the years when we’ve developed Caleb’s care plan at school it’s been a struggle because what we ask for as reasonable accommodations seem to be unheard of which leads me to believe that other students are doing a little “hoping for the best.”

Stacey Simms, the Diabetes Connections podcaster, recently interviewed Steve Edelman, endocrinologist, founder of the Taking Control Of Your Diabetes (TCOYD) conferences and T1D (type 1 diabetic) as well. People with type 1, type 2, their loved ones, and diabetes health care professional all attend TCOYD conferences. They often have separate conference tracks that they attend but some presentations are done as one large group.
Steve commented that one of the favorite parts of his one day conferences is when patients, loved ones and health care professionals are gathered together. The facilitator then tells the group that for the next 20 minutes only patients will be allowed to speak. They are instructed to answer the question, “What do your diabetes health care professionals do that drives you crazy?” Only negative comments are allowed.


The Steve Edelman interview starts at 32:13.
Dr. Edelman sumarizes that patients complain about how little time they are allocated and some are only allowed to bring up one problem. They’re irritated by the criticism that they don’t check their blood sugar often enough or get labeled as non-compliant.
After that provocative 20-minute session ends (how can they fit that into 20 minutes??!), the doctors and other health care professionals are then challenged to answer the question, “What do your diabetes patients do that drive you crazy?”
The doctors, dietitians and educators let it rip with comments that patients often don’t show up to their appointments (moreso with dietitians and educators than with doctors), don’t know what medications they’re taking, lie about their glucose records, and fail to take ownership of their diabetes.
I think we need more of this kind of conversation. I don’t feel my doctors have acted like the natural health care allies that they are.
One of my biggest gripes is the unthinking and reflexive reaction my doctor will make about severe hypoglycemia risk based on an A1c number alone. Or they see a small percentage of CGM (continuous glucose monitor) data below range and jump to the conclusion that my risk of severe hypoglycemia is too high and I should therefore aim for a higher glucose average, long term complications be damned.
I write on this topic knowing the challenges clinicians face, including limited time and having the administrative burden exceed patient face-to-face time. I also realize that some doctors can overcome these embedded hurdles and still provide great care using enlightened communication. I acknowledge that these exemplary doctors exist but I think they are too few.
What drives you crazy about your doctor/health care professional relationship? What do you think we, as patients, can do to nudge that relationship in a better direction?",May '19

For once my new endo that I started seeing in February is actually a health care ally . No chastising me about lows, no labeling me as this or that, willing to write my rxs as I need them as well as prescribing some of the out of they way things I use for diabetes management. Granted his staff isn’t very well trained and they are abysmally slow at getting his orders out to where they need to go but as long as I’m not having some sort of supply related emergency then that’s not impassable.
I think being patient is probably the best quality to make use of when dealing with our medical professionals, as well as knowing when you need to get on the phone to sort out issues. Lastly our strong opinions are vital to our well-being but some dr.s just don’t seem able to handle that sort of patient and those are the kind of dr.s you just have to move on from if at all possible. If the Dr you’re seeing is burned out or has lost their ability to empathise then there isn’t much you can do to fix them so move on.",May '19

I’ve read accounts like yours regarding a great doctor/patient relationship. I wish I could enjoy one like that but I have given up. As long as my doctor is tolerable and their office can handle the burdensome prescription load I represent, I conclude that that is good enough.
My competence dosing my insulin does not need any doctor help. I refuse to talk to dietitians since I’ve found disagreements on a fundamental level.
If I could write my own diabetes prescriptions, I’d be tempted to go without a diabetes doctor.",May '19
4244,Diabetes police and diabetes criminals,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Firenza,4,"Oh I’ve had some terrible Dr/patient relationships and I wouldn’t personally rely on any Dr nowadays for dosing including the one I have now as I’m pretty sure I’m his only patient on Afrezza, but he is understanding and does make suggestions although my answer is usually “tried that didn’t work”. I think the main thing I like about him is that he respects my intelligence and realizes that I’ve had diabetes for almost 30 years, don’t have complications and my a1c is great. I must be doing something right.
One thing that seems to surprise most dr.s is how honest I am about my diabetes (As if they’re expecting me to lie to them). I don’t sugarcoat lows or fudge reports and dr.s expecting lies from their patients is just a product of people not trusting their dr.s to be their allies, which is a sad state of affairs for our dr.s and the patient.",May '19
4245,Diabetes police and diabetes criminals,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Marilyn6,11,"I am a take charge kind of patient. If I have a medical problem of some kind, I research it before I see a doctor, so that I can ask informed questions. It is my understanding that most people don’t do this and prefer to just be told how to treat their condition. I don’t do well with a doctor who just expects me to sit there and not question what they are telling me.
Since I have been a type 1 for 60 yrs and have no diabetic complications my doctor doesn’t question my knowledge. I would promptly quit seeing a doctor who gave me any kind of hassle. I have never seen a dietician or a diabetes educator. I know it wouldn’t go well.
The doctors at the practice I use now talk with their patients for at least 30 minutes at each visit. My doctor is always happy to see me.
If I used an endocrinologist I don’t think I would be nearly as happy with the medical treatment I receive. The one time I was told by my previous doctor to see one, because she didn’t like how low I kept my A1c’s,  I was not impressed with the full waiting room, their demand to turn over my monitor to look at my records and the feeling that I was just a patient and the medical staff were the experts. The endocrinologist ended up telling my previous doctor that I knew what I was doing and to leave me alone.
On the whole I don’t blame doctors too much because so many patients don’t have a clue about handling their diabetes, or they lie about their glucose levels or they just can’t understand the seriousness of the disease, because often the patient doesn’t start seeing complications for a number of years.
But doctors need to also show respect for their diabetic patients who are well informed and are taking excellent care of themselves. Excellent  doctors realize and acknowledge that they can learn a lot from us.",May '19

I’m sympathetic with a clinician forced to see a parade of so many patients each day that we patients are seen as a blur. Having said that, I know I am not a typical diabetes patient. If the doc doesn’t give me the respect I deserve, I am put off.
I know I’m a tough patient, especially for the doctor who sees himself/herself as the definitive font of diabetes knowledge. In that situation, it doesn’t usually go well with me.

4248,Diabetes police and diabetes criminals,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,BeckyZ,8,"I guess my perspective is probably a little different from everyone else’s here. I struggled for years with a complete lack of control. The doctors refused to help, but told me every time I went that I was going to die before age 30. It happened with every pediatrician except my pediatric endocrinologist. They knew less about the disease than I did, had 0 empathy for a 12 year old taking care of this disease by herself, and gave the least helpful suggestions I’ve ever heard. Then, when I failed, it was my fault and I was told all the worst horror stories about going blind and having amputations. Even when I made improvement, it wasn’t recognized, and I still got the “you’re going to die” lecture. So, I just stopped trying. They made me believe that death was inevitable. Then when I turned 18 in high school and lost my pediatric endocrinologist, I lost the only ally I had, and it became a living nightmare to go to any type of doctor. Again, even when I made improvement, I got the same speech, up to even 5 or 6 years ago when my husband had to drive me to the gynecologist because my endocrinologist had reported a seizure I had in the middle of the night to the dumb, and then refused to sign the paperwork until I got a lower hba1c (the definition of diabetes police, and completely illogical). My hba1c was in the high 8s at the time, which was actually a massive improvement and one of the reasons I had a seizure. The gynecologist talked directly to my husband and told him if I ever got pregnant, I would have a baby born without limbs, or missing a heart or brain. She basically wanted my husband to police me. He got so scared he just said we’d never have children and it took me years to convince him she was just fear mongering (because again, she gave no useful advice, just laid out worst case scenarios). Even last year, I had an obstetrician tell me if my hba1c was above 5.6, I would have complications with my pregnancy.
Then, on the other side of the coin, they are trying to scare you guys into higher hba1cs because they want you to be afraid of low blood sugars. Its impossible to win with them. In my experience, less than 5 percent of doctors are actually supportive and not just judgmental fear mongers or overpaid prescription pads. I acknowledge good doctors exist, but they’re the minority. Nowadays, I prefer the overpaid prescription pad style of doctor because I just don’t need any more judgement in my life.
Sorry this was a really long rant, and I am seeing a therapist to work through my trust issues with authority, but my childhood was less than idyllic, and thinking about it gets me a bit worked up.",May '19
4249,Diabetes police and diabetes criminals,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Mental and Emotional Wellness,Firenza,4,"My experience with dr.s is for the most part similar to yours but I think the difference for me was in my mother not taking any b.s. from medical professionals. If they were being bad dr.s then we left and found someone else (We even moved across the state to be closer to dr.s that had a clue). I received all of those warnings too, I knew what dialysis was when I was 5 and the threat of amputation or blindness terrified me throughout my childhood. I’m pretty sure one Dr also told me I wouldn’t be able to have kids.
That kind of fear mongering is unconscionable especially to a child. We do need to know the risks of this disease but hammering the point rarely works, whether you are trying your hardest to be healthy or completely ignoring your diabetes.",May '19

A couple of years passed and I knew that I was not well, but I also knew that I wasn’t going to settle for mediocre care and treatment. By chance, I had to go to my doctor’s clinic for an employment mini-physical and she seemed so kind and mentioned she was taking on new patients if I needed a medical home. When my insurance went into effect I called to see if she’d take me on given my history and she said she was up for the challenge.
Together we are a good health care team. My appointments are a quick checkup, review of recent blood tests, and long discussion of what is and isn’t working. It is very interactive and she’s very invested in my technology, we discuss treatment guidelines, lifestyle choices, medications, etc. She says that my success has inspired her to be a better doctor for her other patients.",May '19

And I have attended one of these TCOYD conferences where I was in one of these breakout sessions. And my take away from it was the lack of communication and understanding about where the other was coming from on both sides.
I have been so very blessed to have had some great doctors over the years. And while that first endo I had as a small child was the one that did all the mental damage to my psyche, the rest have helped to make me feel as normal as one can be with diabetes.
All my doctors are open to discussion on treatment options. All my doctors have seen me cry with the frustration. Some have seen the joy of beautiful babies. Some have seen the horror to my mental well being of losing a baby. They have all been with me through depression and success. And we have always come to an agreement on goals. We might not always agree but they have all realized that I am the one driving this car.
I do understand that most people don’t have access to many choices and have to settle. I also understand I am blessed to be in an area where there are so many options. I think video linking would be such a great idea for those who have no access. I wish you all had access to great care. Please know there are very good doctors out there and many do really care. Just keep the communication open. I had no problem telling one of my earlier doctors that I wasn’t testing as much as he wanted and why. So instead of yelling at me, we worked out how many I could do and which ones would give us the most information. But if he didn’t know where I was and I didn’t know which ones really mattered, we might not have been able to move forward.

They are not the loud talking grandstanders who broadcast their workplace victories to any who will listen. Instead, they quietly and competently perform their jobs and see their talents as nothing unusual.
Dr. Jen Unwin is a clinical psychologist who practices in the UK and specializes in treating people with chronic health conditions. Soft-spoken and unassuming, she is well-suited to her work. Her interview style is to raise questions with her patients in a way that is not threatening yet plants ideas that arise in her patients as if they were their own.
Jen Unwin and her general-practitioner husband, David, presented at the Low Carb Denver conference last March. Just released this last week is a video featuring her produced by the “low-carb cardiologist,” Dr. Bret Scher. Just so you know, this video does not proselytize about low-carb eating, but is about mental and emotional wellness.
I watched this video and found that it gets to the kernel of truth that anyone who must confront when living with a chronic health condition, like diabetes. And that truth answers the question, “how do we sustain motivation to treat an illness that we must live with, all day, every day?”
We see our doctor every 90 days, yet this topic seldom arises. We’re faced with the hard clinical data of A1c’s, time in range, and average glucose and often left with the idea that we must “just try harder,” if we want to improve. There’s little, if anything, done to replenish the motivational gas tank that might even make health improvements possible.
Enjoy this video. It inspired me!

Refusing accommodation of your medical need to keep diabetes supplies with you during an event seems like a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.


Just an FYI, it is a violation, though a lot of people don’t realize that. Way too many people think of diabetes as a diease … an inconvenience. It is a disability according to the Americans with Disabilities Act. Your endocrine system doesn’t work correctly,  and this puts your life in danger if you don’t have the supplies that you need. What those supplies are varies depending on the type of diabetes and how it is treated, so getting some kind of official note is usually needed if you need to ask for “reasonable accommodations” to be made.
Personally, I don’t hesitate to point out the fact that it is a disability. As a security officer (private security), I know that part of my job is to be sure that everyone at my site is as safe as I can make them, and that includes helping to be sure that anyone with a disability gets what they need to function and be safe. Generally, it’s someone else’s actual job, but I might be called on to help. I don’t ever want to be called on to explain why I contributed to a situation that put someone in danger.",Nov '19

This is a very interesting question.

I’m the complete opposite, if he’s trending high it drives me nuts to think about not correcting it promptly, but even more nuts if I see a dexcom trace that has been out of range for hours. It’s funny because in most things I’m a major procrastinator, but at the same time I’m very geared towards efficiency, so I hate the wasted opportunity of time spent at 9.5mmol/L that could have been taken down to 5.5 with a quick correction or temp basal.",Aug '19

It’s interesting to consider whether there is causality in the relationship between early treatment and lower anxiety & depression, and if so, which is the cause and which the effect? I guess it depends which is the greater stressor; is it the activity of monitoring and treating high/low BGL (hypervigilance), or is it the worry about the consequences of the high/low BGL (and/or concern about your ability to successfully treat the high/low).

At one diabetes conference several years ago, someone voiced an outlook about diabetes numbers that helped me put things in perspective. They said to view any diabetes number as a signpost, just one datapoint that suggested where you should travel next.
That helped me to look forward instead of backwards and see the opportunity I now had to make things better going forward. My impatience was served well by my adoption of Afrezza and also intramuscular injections to rein in high glucose levels. I would also use exercise in a tactical fashion when my blood sugar was high.

I have been diabetic since age 11. I used manual injection and ran an a1c in the 7’s. Then, I started a pump and almost died. I went back to MI. It took a long time for my Doc (and people on this site) to persuade me to pump again. We started by trying split MI dosages. But, once I got hardware that worked for me, my a1c dropped into the 6’s. Now, with some basic system automation, I expect to drop into the 5’s. That is possible because the automated system has decreased system variability - something  that was a real problem for me when I joined this site years ago. I used to ■■■■■ about it with Terry. That was not something I was ever going to overcome without appropriate tech and putting in a lot of time.
I, too, reacted to CGM data with rage. I felt as if I had been lied to, for my whole life, about how things worked. Medical practitioners did not understand what the data revealed. It took us all a long time to adjust to the new understanding of diabetes. Many people are still not there in medicine. But, many people are. I immediately wanted system automation and analysis.

The concept of “good enough” is a difficult one for many people to grasp. It requires judgment, self-love, and wisdom.

Not sure I would agree with your characterization of frequent monitoring of your CGM number as obsessive. Glucose metabolism in the non-diabetic is exquisitely controlled in a very tight range-- it shows how important the human body has determined optimal glucose to be for overall well-being.
As people with diabetes, we do need to accept some less than optimal glucose excursions. I see “obsession” as a frequent behavior where the compulsive activity begins and ends with the actual behavior.
Overly frequent hand-washing or constant checking and rechecking to see if we’ve locked our doors is behavior I see as obsessive. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and using that info to take action with timely and effective counter-measures is not obsessive from my point of view.
The charge of obsessiveness with this kind of behavior is often offered by people who enjoy the luxury of a working pancreas, someone who has never felt the visceral threat of a severe hypoglycemic incident.
If frequent CGM-monitoring is causing you to feel anxious, then I see that as a separate issue that should be explored and effective action taken.",Aug '19

a man weighing 60 kg and able to tolerate 100 g of carbohydrate might end up on 60 g of protein, 130 g of fat and 25 g of carbohydrate. His daily ration of the latter might consist of 7 oz (198 g) of thrice boiled cabbage, or 5 oz (142 g) of similarly treated spinach or two and a half bran biscuits [10]. The bran was needed to counteract the constipation induced by the rest of the diet.
Adults did relatively well on this regimen, but children hovered miserably between death from diabetes and death from starvation. One 12-year-old boy, already blind from diabetes, was reduced to eating toothpaste mixed with birdseed stolen from his pet canary. ‘These facts were obtained by confession after long and plausible denials’, remarked the pitiless Allen. The unfortunate child died of starvation. A few physicians hailed the treatment as a means of prolonging life, but Carl von Noorden shuddered and turned away when Joslin showed him one of his cases. The controversy concerning the value of extra months or years purchased at the cost of so much misery was very bitter, and Allen was banned from the diabetic clinic at the Rockefeller Institute in 1918 [11].

Until earlier this year when my husband (non-diabetic) came down with a horrible stomach bug and couldn't stop vomiting and running a high fever. One of my witchdoctor friends ;) brought some Peppermint oil over and by that point he was willing to try anything. After about 10 min of using it, he'd stopped vomiting and his fever broke.It wasn't long after that I decided to sign up for the premium starter kit. And I can honestly say it was THE best investment I've ever made in my family's health. I have a 6 yr old son and twin 1 year olds. There was always germs coming in our house and being diabetic, I was always catching something. My 6 yr old suffers from terrible allergies - we were on rescue inhaler, and breathing treatments, and have even gone to the ER for allergy-induced asthma. I'd even had to give my twins breathing treatments before.Fast forward to now. It's been almost 6 months since we started using oils, and not one of us have been on an antibiotic or anything OTC. In SIX months. That's unheard of. We were in the pediatrician's office at least once a month for someone. And the only two times we've been this year have been for yearly checkups.We use them every day. As soon as my son starts to wheeze a little, I pull out the oils, and he stops. Before, we'd have had to pull out the breathing machine and albuterol.I've also been able to wean off of the anxiety meds I'd been on since my twins were born last year.Other than the benefits of boosting my immune system, I've found another oil that's working great to control my post meal spikes - it's designed for women's hormones ... and it's working great for me- I have PCOS and it's helping with side effects from that, as well.I am happy to report that I'm now one of my crazy friend that I used to laugh about. And I would not have it any other way!!! If anyone else uses them and wants to share success stories, I'd love to hear them - it makes my heart happy to hear how well they work in other people's lives, too!!! And if you have any other questions about them, or about how they're working for MY family .. just ask! :)

These oils are recommendable for many inflammatory issues like stomach and bowel conditions. T1 is an autoimmune condition and as such T1 diabetics are very prone to these problems. After finding out that I am lactose intolerant it was the treatment with encymatic helpers for the lactose, fish oil and lineseed oil daily that helped to calm down my bowel again.

Ever since Dexcom was approved by Medicare, the product codes for items shipped to Medicare patients were different than those same items sent to non-Medicare patients.  This is nothing new with the G6.  I read the entire approval process Dexcom went through when first set up for Medicare approval but don’t remember all the intricacies.

I had assumed that the more oblong to more square packaging was simply a packaging change as I received several months of Medicare G6 sensors in the oblong box and the last 3-4 months have come in the more square box.  Maybe non-Medicare G6 users can tell us if they have seen a packaging change as well.
I have only had G6 sensors under medicare, but wonder whether the Medicare specific labeling is due to this being DME under Medicare rather than a “normal” prescription. Do they have a different part number?  I don’t have access to any non-Medicare packaging.

The shipping companies don’t have to handle everything themselves, as they parcel out the work to other companies…land, sea, and air… If USPS is stepping out, then equipment will be sold, leased, or otherwise contracted to companies that will still see the deliveries, through.

This is the kind of fight I’ve easily joined in the past but now I wonder whether it’s worth it or not. I think it is ignorant, unfair, and unhealthy for Medicare and CVS to engage in this policy trend. Medicare policy, by the way, permits the doctor to over-ride this quantity limit as a medical necessity. CVS has taken this one step further than Medicare.

4393,CVS will enforce 3x/day Medicare test strip limit,Diabetes Advocacy,Diabetes Advocacy,MOOBM,2,"Medicare allows three times a day if you are on insulin and one time a day if you are not on insulin.   (Four times a day if you are on an insulin pump which may not be stated in the “test strip rules” but Medicare WILL NOT pay for an insulin pump and/or supplies unless you are testing exactly four times a day).   Medicare allows for patient’s to exceed that if it is documented in the patient’s chart file.   What many patients (and providers) don’t realize is Medicare audits the BAHOOEY out of pharmacies.  In 2011, Medicare did some sort of study and discovered it had allowed 6 million dollars in claims to be paid out “inappropriately”.  There were three types of errors: 1) They paid for test strips when patient through the retail pharmacy when the patient was in the hospital. 2) They paid for test strips through retail pharmacy when patient was in a skilled nursing facility. 3) They paid for test strips for people who “without documented diagnosis code for diabetes.”
(I had to laugh at #3 because one of the top five reasons given (instead of diabetes) with the last one was: “Chronic long term use of insulin.”  I can’t think of many reasons that a person would be using insulin without having a diagnoses of diabetes and anyway, anyone using insulin, regardless of the diagnosis, should be allow to test their blood sugars.)
So now Medicare audits the pharmacies to death.   (They even audit the pharmacy twice on the same patient in a 30 day period).
Medicare lays out it’s requirements for the “documentation” and, on paper, it doesn’t look TOO bad and, in the beginning it wasn’t.
This auditing process originally started to make sure that the government wasn’t paying out claims where they shouldn’t but it has taken on a life of its own.
Knowing the documentation required, I would say that the vast majority of the providers don’t submit documentation that is up to the Medicare test strip police’s exacting standards.  Don’t get me wrong, I think that most provider’s documentation is more than adequate to answer the question of whether the test strips are medically necessary it just that as time as passed and more and more providers are meeting that documentation requirement, the auditors are being hard pressed to find things “wrong” and so are nit-picking over the slightest thing.
Here are the requirements for the prescription:
There must be a written order for all testing supplies. The written order must contain the
following elements:
 That they have diabetes
 What kind of blood glucose monitor they need and why they need it (that is, if they
need a special monitor because of vision problems, their doctor must explain that.)
 Whether they use insulin
 How often they should test their blood glucose
That sounds simple but here’s the “extras” that are also “required”:


You cannot use a range for test supplies (such as 4-5 times a day).   It must be an exact number.


It must be a “wet” signature so if it is sent electronically and the pharmacy doesn’t receive with a copy of the “actual signature” but an electronic version then it must be done again with a “wet signature.”  (To my knowledge this is not the case with anything else.)


You must write the diagnosis code (ICD10) for the diabetes not the words “Type 1” or “Type 2” but you cannot use the diagnosis code for insulin (you have to physically write “on insulin or not on insulin”)  (This one is a 50/50, depends on the auditor).


If you have to fill out a prescription “form” there can be ABSOLUTELY no errors, cross offs, hesitations, “write over”, white out, etc.   Doesn’t matter if the provider signs the errors and dates them.  You do any of that and you have to start over.  (It didn’t used to be this way but it kept getting stricter and stricter and stricter.


If the testing exceeds Medicare’s allotment then “officially” what is needed is:

Basic coverage criteria for all home glucose monitors and related accessories and supplies are met; and, (That they are diabetic and are trained to use the glucose meter)
Within the six (6) months prior to ordering quantities of strips and lancets that exceed the utilization guidelines, the treating practitioner has had an in-person visit with the beneficiary to evaluate their diabetes control and their need for the specific quantity of supplies that exceeds the usual utilization amounts described above; and,
Every six (6) months, for continued dispensing of quantities of testing supplies that exceed the usual utilization amounts, the treating practitioner must verify adherence to the high utilization testing regimen.
TYPES of things that may be in the documentation:
Names, dosages, and timing of administration of medications used to treat the
diabetes;
o Frequency and severity of symptoms related to hyperglycemia and/or
hypoglycemia;
o Review of beneficiary-maintained log of glucose testing values;
o Changes in the patient’s treatment regimen as a result of glucose testing results
review;
o Dosage adjustments that the patient should make on their own based on selftesting results;
o Laboratory tests indicating level of glycemic control (e.g., hemoglobin A1C);
o Other therapeutic interventions and results.
ALTHOUGH, “Not every patient medical record will contain all of these elements; however, there must be enough information in the patient’s medical record to support the medical necessity for the quantity of item(s) ordered and dispensed.”
REALITY:
Listed on the chart note under medications must be the test strips and lancets with
all the information like it was a prescription.
It should also be in the discussion section.
Be sure to use the “most present tense” language such as “is currently testing” not just “is.”
Thirty days of glucose logs.   (It says you have to have documentation that you reviewed the logs…Uh, no.   Physical logs are a must.
You must state justification in EVERY SINGLE NOTE even if it hasn’t changed.  Such as “Patient has been testing and is currently continuing to test their blood sugars six times a day.   Patient doses their insulin on a sliding scale and checks their blood sugars before each meal and then two hours after each meal to monitor insulin dosing.”

As a patient, if your prescription says you are testing four times a day.  Then you’d better be testing exactly FOUR times a day.   Not three. Not five.   Heaven forbid, one day you test more frequently or one day you test less frequently.   Oh, and there is no such things as “dud” strips (Being sarcastic).  And NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, EVER share your test strips with your spouse (even if the are also diabetic and have their own prescription for test strips) because that is a MASSIVE mess.  (Again, being
CVS is probably tired of getting their money taken back by Medicare when technically the documentation most likely fits the WRITTEN requirements.
The whole thing is a Catch-22.   CVS is not the patient’s medical doctor.   It is not up to them to determine what is medically necessary.
That being said, they are a business, and if they are losing significant amounts of money because of Medicare auditors’ overzealous enforcement, then I get that they can no longer deal with this.
If you want to complain, you need to be complaining to Medicare for making it so difficult that pharmacies don’t what to support Medicare patients.   Personally, I’d love to do a study of how much money Medicare has taken back inappropriately when documentation fits the requirements that as they are written.   I can bet it is a lot.",Feb '19

Editor’s Note:  It is an extremely personal decision to protest, and Beyond Type 1 neither endorses nor opposes any person living with diabetes’ participation. This guide is to help those who choose to protest do so as safely as possible.
Protesting is one of many ways to create change and is a right of all Americans under the First Amendment. But if you have diabetes, there are extra things to consider, particularly amidst COVID-19.
Having diabetes – Type 1 or Type 2 – presents challenges in daily life already; adding a challenging environment with risk of exposure to a virus makes things more complicated. Because of that, you may choose to lend your voice to the things you care about from home, which is also impactful.
However, if you are heading out to protest, here’s what you need to know.
Be Prepared
Step 1: Make sure you are healthy enough and prepared to participate.  Consider the state of your health over the last few days and weeks. The best circumstances under which to attend a protest are when your blood sugars have been stable, you have been eating hearty and nutritious meals, you are well-hydrated, your immune system is strong, and your mental health is fortified.
Step 2: Pack a bag.  In addition to the standard items suggested for all protesters, like extra masks/face coverings, cash, your health insurance card, permanent markers, water, and snacks, there are extra things to consider if you have diabetes. Remember that you may get stuck away from home for a longer period of time than planned.

Double down on water. While heavy, staying hydrated can keep your blood sugar levels more manageable and can prevent other health issues. When volunteers or street medics offer more water, accept their offer.
Bring a variety of snacks, with a combination of carbohydrates and protein, and glucagon (nasal or injectable kit). It is helpful to have both fast-acting glucose, like glucose tabs or gels, to raise your blood sugar quickly if you experience a low, as well as more substantial snacks to consume periodically to keep your blood sugar stable. Ensure that the people you’re going with know how to use glucagon, including what personal signs of a low blood sugar you experience that they can look out for.
Pack extra blood sugar monitoring supplies. Even if you have a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), it is possible for your sensor to fail or become inaccurate due to heat causing your adhesive to loosen or jostling from being in a crowd. With either your CGM or glucose monitor, make sure you are checking your levels often. If you have a closed-loop system and can utilize an ‘exercise’ setting to keep your blood sugar levels slightly higher (typically around 160 mg/dL), do so.
Include a back-up insulin delivery method. If you wear an insulin pump, bring insulin pens (with extra pen needles) or vials and syringes. If you utilize injections, make sure you have more supplies than you typically need. Consider packing in a small cooler system/insulated bag to keep your insulin cool.
Write down your medical information on index cards kept in the outer pocket of your bag. This should include your medical background information (all medical issues you live with), your medications, and the contact information for your healthcare provider and emergency contact.
We are still living in a pandemic, so pack extra face masks, hand sanitizer, and disinfecting wipes. If you accept water or snacks from volunteers, ensure you sanitize surfaces, like the opening of a water bottle. COVID-19 is challenging, but made more challenging by diabetes management. Minimize your risks to stay safe. 


Step 3: Wear protective articles of clothing + a medical alert item.  Wear a mask or face covering, long pants, comfortable closed-toed shoes, a long sleeve shirt, a hat and/or sunglasses, plus a medical alert item, like a bracelet or necklace.

If you do not have a medical alert item, write your alerts on your arm using permanent marker. This could something like “insulin-dependent, type 1 diabetes.” Your alerts should be as clear as possible, helping a person completely unfamiliar with diabetes be more aware of your health background.
Protective clothing – long sleeves, sunglasses, hat, etc. – shields you from the sun, and will also provide a barrier for your skin in case tear gas is deployed. A primary component of tear gas is capsaicin, a chemical compound derived from chili peppers. As tear gas (made from fine particles) is absorbed by your skin, it can produce extensive amounts of inflammation. This can lead to health issues in anyone, but can lead to issues with blood sugar, extra pain response, and dehydration for people with diabetes.

Step 4: Have a buddy and communicate.  No one should go to a protest alone if possible, but particularly no one with an underlying health condition. Ensure you attend a protest with someone you trust, who knows you have diabetes, and can help look out for the signs of low or high blood sugar. Ask them to remind you to drink water and eat. Create a plan for where and when to meet if you get separated. Be clear about your limits and make sure you are in agreement about your boundaries. For example, if you are attending with someone who is willing to be arrested and you are not, you will no longer have your buddy system intact, which could lead to a safety issue.
Step 5: Take care of yourself when you get home.  Chances are you just walked a long distance and tensions were high. Hydrate and eat once you get back home or to a safe place. Your blood sugar may drop or rise in unexpected ways due to stress and exertion. Keep an eye on your blood sugar levels as much as possible. If you have a CGM with follow capabilities, ask a friend or family member to make sure their alerts are loud, particularly while you sleep.
Know Your Rights
Attending a protest carries the risk of being detained or arrested. Because of this, ensure you know your rights before you attend. Be aware that while everyone in the US has the same rights theoretically, being undocumented, a person of color, or belonging to any marginalized group – including living with diabetes – alters how you may need to approach interactions with members of law enforcement.
The following is summarized from the American Diabetes Association’s Inappropriate Law Enforcement Response to Individuals with Diabetes.

If you get arrested, clearly and calmly state to the police officer that you have diabetes. If you are concerned about or nearing a medical episode – such as a low or high blood sugar event – while detained, communicate the circumstances to the officer. By law, if an officer has visible cues (such as clear signs of a low or high blood sugar) or has been given notice of a person’s medical condition, they must abide by the resulting rights that provides.
You have a right to be able to take care of your health and receive medical assistance if and as needed. The Fourteenth Amendment grants the right of pretrial detainees (anyone who has been detained, arrested, or jailed) to adequate medical care.
Under the Fourth Amendment, a police officer is not allowed to search or confiscate your belongings without a warrant or without probable cause. If a police officer believes they have probable cause, they must inform you of what they are searching, as well as what they are seizing.  Consensual seizures  are  not  prohibited by the Fourth Amendment, so you must state that you do not consent for your belongings to be seized. This all becomes more murky if the police officer can make a case that a severe crime was being committed, an immediate threat is being posed to the officer or public, or if you are resisting or otherwise evading arrest. Stay calm, be clear, and follow directions as much as possible.

Overall, if you are considering or attending a protest, safety comes first. Be prepared. Be careful. Know your rights.",Jun '20

Have a buddy and communicate.


Be prepared for cell service to not work in the area. Our cell towers got shut down to hinder communications. Wireless communications may or may not get blocked. This might happen on purpose or on accident.
As far as diabetes tech functioning at a protest, know that heavy police radio use and media equipment might produce too much interference for bluetooth (Dexcom) or Omnipod’s radio frequency comm to work reliably. I recommend bringing extra supplies in case equipment malfunctions and you need to swap out a pump or a sensor.
In the past, when I have been in similar environments, I have had both my pump and my CGM go down. Sometimes it happens twice in a row. (That is unusual for me, so I believe interference plays a large role in inhibiting diabetic system communications.) If there are efforts to actively block communications, I expect even more communication failures. Blue tooth is a weak signal, compared with police radios. It can get overpowered.
I recommend bringing Manual Injection and an old fashioned meter if your in an area with:
1.) Heavy police presence (multiple agencies working on multiple radio frequencies);
2.) News media broadcasts; and,
3.) Large gatherings of people with lots of cellphones
Or, if there are any warnings they will institute wireless communications blocking of any kind (Note: you may or may not be directly informed about that activity. Things get confused and chaotic and sometimes things happen spontaneously.).
If you experience heavy radio frequency interference resulting in device failure, your best bet is to move to a new geographic location. Note that this may or may not be possible in a chaotic environment. If you were, for instance, arrested, you might be waiting hours to be taken in. So, manual injection will always be your best fallback.",Jun '20

Thus far, it is not clear that the George Floyd protest have exacerbated COVID-19 cases … but, in most states, it is probably too early to know.
Regarding the data in Minnesota, I happen to be downloading data from the COVID tracking project (covidtracking.com 1) and have the ability to plot new COVID-19 cases on a daily basis scaled per 100,000 residents (based on the 2019 census estimates for each county).
Based on that data, I see no big increase in the last couple of weeks and in terms of per-capita new cases Nobles, Stearns, and Kandiyohi seem to have had the biggest number of new, daily per-capita cases.  Let me know if I missed a county of interest or included some that you don’t care about.  However, thus far, Hennepin and Ramsey show no significant increases …
So, I conclude that from a COVID-19 perspective, turkey processing is more problematic than protests.

I will try to repeat this in a week or so.  Note: without knowing MN, my guess is that Nobles has a small population … a peak of 400 new cases per day per 100,000 people is a BIG number.  I’ve been keeping an eye on the predominantly Native American counties in AZ and NM and at their worst, they have seen peak new per-capita case rates of 100-200 cases per day per 100,000 residents.
Looking at the data for Hennepin and Ramsey county in another week, as you suggest, may be of interest not only to you, but the broader community, to see if there is a correlation between protest activity and follow-on increases in COVID-19 cases.
Of course, the states that have tried to “get back to normal” quickly seem to be already showing increases in their daily case loads … but, for those of us in the higher risk category, looking at all of the factors that result in  increased transmission are likely of interest to us as we plan our individual activities.

4424,New guidance from the US Treasury opens door to high deductible exemptions for diabetes care,Diabetes Advocacy,Diabetes Advocacy,MilaStaff,4,"WRITTEN BY: Beyond Type 1 Editorial Team 1
On July 17, the U.S. Treasury issued new guidance which aims to make accessing medications for chronic conditions easier 2 under some insurance plans. The guidance is specific to people enrolled in High Deductible Health Plans (HDHP) that include Health Savings Accounts (HSA).
HSAs allow people to put aside money pre-tax to be spent on certain medical expenses, and the accounts can be rolled over from year to year. Previously the federal tax code specifically barred these plans from covering drugs and services for common chronic conditions until enrollees met their deductibles. This change will allow insurers to cover certain treatments before the deductibles are met.
Preventative treatments are typically exempted from the deductible phase of an HDHP, and this new guidance expands the list of what can count as a preventative service to include drugs and tests relevant to the management of chronic conditions, including insulin for people living with diabetes.

Insurance providers as well as advocacy groups have been pushing for these changes; managing chronic health conditions before they become exacerbated and indeed — more costly — can be viewed as a win-win for both patient and insurer. For people with diabetes, uninterrupted access to insulin is both life-sustaining and cost saving.
The reasoning for the guidance is explained as follows: “Cost barriers for care have resulted in some individuals who are diagnosed with certain chronic conditions failing to seek or utilize effective and necessary care that would prevent exacerbation of the chronic condition. Failure to address these chronic conditions has been demonstrated to lead to consequences, such as amputation, blindness, heart attacks, and strokes that require considerably more extensive medical intervention.”
The guidance does not require any formal rule-making process, and can go into effect for insurance plans starting in 2020. There are some conditions on what treatments can be approved under this new guidance, listed as follows:

The service or item is low-cost;
There is medical evidence supporting high cost efficiency (a large expected impact) of preventing exacerbation of the chronic condition or the development of a secondary condition; and
There is a strong likelihood, documented by clinical evidence, that with respect to the class of individuals prescribed the item or service, the specific service or use of the item will prevent the exacerbation of the chronic condition or the development of a secondary condition that requires significantly higher cost treatments.

The guidance is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to fix prescription drug pricing, and was in direct response to last month’s Executive Order  “Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare To Put Patients First” 2.  The EO directly called on The Secretary of the Treasury to “issue guidance to expand the ability of patients to select high-deductible health plans that can be used alongside a health savings account, and that cover low-cost preventive care, before the deductible, for medical care that helps maintain health status for individuals with chronic conditions.”
If health insurance plans decide to take advantage of this new rule, out of pocket costs could be substantially cut for millions of Americans currently enrolled in the impacted insurance plans. For people with Type 1 diabetes specifically, high deductible phases can mean a sudden inability to afford the high list price of insulin, which is often over $1000 per month. Exempting insulin from the deductible would ensure more seamless access to the life-sustaining drug.",Jul '19

So if a drug is $100 and you have to pay 20%, you pay $20 and the insurance company pays $80.   Then, the insurance company turns around and gets a 50% rebate so (on their portion or the full amount, I’m not sure so either $40-50).  So you have paid $20, and the plan ends up only paying $30-40.  What I really like to know is what happens when you have a deductible?   If you pay the $100 as part of your deductible, does the plan still get their 50% rebate from the pharma?    (My guess is yes.  If that is true than you have paid $100 and the plan gets $40-50 on something they haven’t even paid out on).   That thought irritates me to no end.",Jan '20

Need feedback


TiR [time in range] with a self-defined range reminds me too much of “Every child gets a trophy”. Let’s get real. Use TiNR. Time In Normal Range: 70 -120. Almost no T1 will achieve 100% TiNR. I don’t understand the desire to define a range that is clearly not normal and then to celebrate to be within.


Continuing the discussion from Need feedback 1:
I read @Helmut’s comment last night and woke up this morning thinking about it. I’ve observed that the medical consensus regarding time in range has decided to use the 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) as a standard. I realize that they likely just want to create a landmark that they can use for comparison within the population of people with diabetes.
A dark side of that choice is that many patients will view that range as “normal and successful” for someone with diabetes. I, for one, have decided that while they can utilize that range for their academic, clinical, and research purposes, but I created and live by my own comparison range for metabolic success.
To begin with, I don’t start to observe physical symptoms of hypoglycemia until I hit 65 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L). I spend a fair amount of time in the 65-69 mg/dL bracket and question, why should I concede this metabolically normal for me statistical turf? My performance as measured by my Dexcom CGM provides important feedback to me and helps sustain my motivation.
The higher limit that they set at 180 mg/dL or 10.0 mmol/L is unambitious, uninspiring, and tepid for me. I currently use 140 mg/dL or 7.8 mmol/L. I’ve also used 120 mg/dL for a time but decided that even gluco-normals do spend some time in the 120-140 mg/dL (6.7-7.8 mmol/L) range.
The important point, I realized, is that they don’t spend much time in that range. Their healthy pancreas pulls down their post-meal sugars back below 120 in relatively short order. I use my average glucose level to help monitor this reality. I shoot for under 100 mg/dL (5.6). If I can keep it at that level, then I know that I don’t have much of the 120-140 component in play.
Neither mine, nor your blood sugar metrics, @Helmut, represent well the diabetic cohort, unfortunately. So, I think that the 70-180 standard, while uninspiring to us, does help a considerable portion of our brethren. I know because I lived with A1c’s up into the low 8’s for a time. An A1c of 8.0% represents an average blood glucsose of 183 mg/dL (10.2).
For someone who uses the 70-180 range to motivate them to pull down excessive hyperglycemia into a better range, then I think that is useful. I think that reaching for better, in every human endeavor, is a helpful guide.
For those who find it easy to to fit their glucose statistics into the 70-180 range, I encourage them to lower the upper level down to 160 and then 140 to challenge them to reach healthier glucose metabolism.
I’ve read recently that only 12% of the American population can be considered metabolically healthy. That amazes me. But I see the level of obesity and the poor nutritional choices people make and tend to believe that alarming statistic. The demonization of dietary fat, especially saturated fat, has not served us well. Processed foods, especially grains, have contributed to our ill health. The low fat craze that started around 1980 also show the start of obesity and type 2 diabetes in this wildly unsuccessful population level experiment.
Our species can trace its roots back to about two million years ago. Evolution is a relatively slow process, especially when measured by our short lifetimes. Humans began cultivating grains about 10,000 years ago, only 1/2 of 1% of our two million year evolutionary track.
I think it’s one of the reasons we modern humans have suffered metabolically. It has made even worse impacts on our health when we figured out how to mass produce highly processed and highly palatable foods to consume. That combined with the public health decision to try to separate us from fats (meats), a nutrient that coincided with the rapid (evolutionarily rapid, that is) increase in brain size was a poor choice from my perspective.
In summary, I think that the 70-180 time in range (TIR) standard adopted by academics, clinicians, and researchers will help most of our group but individuals should be encouraged to tighten those limits to a healthier range when possible. Reaching for better is always better!",Oct '19

My gut feel is the clinical recommendations for the 70-180 range goes along with the blanket recommendation of shooting for an a1c below 7 that many of us heard when first diagnosed.
I’ve found that my TIR is episodic. For example, I just took a long trip, drove 4300 miles, lots of unpredictable meals eaten behind the wheel and generally poor sleep quality, little exercise. Experience tells me that a long day driving is terrible for my BG control. I was happy whenever I was in a  range of 70-180 for those weeks.
I monitor a rolling two-week TIR for that reason. When I am home and in my routine, no anomalies pop up etc. I use 70-150 as my range and often hit 80%. There is usually at least one anomaly during those two weeks, like a restaurant meal, an unpredictable pint of micro brew, a day spent mostly driving, or a day spent sitting in a meeting, etc. Breaking that TIR tracking down to two weeks helps me isolate those anomalies and figure out how to approach them next time.",Oct '19

These of course can all be micro managed with a CGM, however, when these life happens events are thrown at us we often ignore them with good reason as it is more important to be in full presence of the anomaly and totally enjoy that meal, pint of brew, drive, meeting,  family, friends etc. and put diabetes management on hold for a moment.

I am angry at the many doctors that told me that my control was excellent and I should keep doing what I was doing. I met today’s standards and still ended up with complications after only 25 years. During these years my happiness was closely linked to the color of urine test strips. My insurance paid for 100 strips per month but since they were so cheap I bought enough to test 100% of the time. I also started consuming a lot of fluid and peeing frequently so that the test results were less outdated. My assumption was that I had stayed below 180 if the urine test strip didn’t change color. Fast forward to today. ADA recommends to stay below 180 at least 70% of the time. 30% is 7 hours per day. Releasing sugar into my urine for 7 hours per day, every day, sounds so wrong.",Oct '19

4465,Time in range standard is not set in stone,Diabetes Advocacy,Diabetes Advocacy,Terry4,2,"For those of us who use a CGM, time in range is a great statistic to follow. Whether the standard 70-180 range or something tighter is what motivates us, I think we should also pay close attention to standard deviation.
Standard Deviation (SD) is a measure of how close our data resides to the average or mean glucose for any period. The smaller the number, the closer the data is to the average. It is denominated in mg/dL or mmol/L.
If your data set does not diverge too far from the average then it greatly reduces the risk that a blood glucose level level near one of your boundaries will dive or skyrocket well beyond your limits. A low standard deviation increases your confidence to stand pat when you see a 71 mg/dL and your limit is 70.
For several years I aimed to keep my SD at 30 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or less. That target helped me a lot. I now shoot for lower.
For me, I could not experience a SD at this level without my carb-limited way of eating. Prior to limiting carbs my SD was more typically at 45-60 mg/dL or more. That meant I had to aggressively “defend” any trend headed toward my lower limit. That meant adding emergency carbs and often lead to the glucose roller-coaster.
I realize that some here can eat more carbs and still manage well-behaved CGM traces but I’ve not been able to do that. Diabetes is often metabolic mayhem and we can often do the same thing day after day and see different results. Eating is probably the single biggest factor (I know there are many more!) that we actually control, so I choose to employ a way of eating that enhances my chance of enjoying good post-meal lines.
No food tastes better than a great blood sugar feels! The great blood sugar sensation lasts much longer and it’s emotionally satisfying, too.",Oct '19

Those of us with T1D who have used CGM’s for a number of years are far more comfortable with the data than those who’ve only used CGM’s a short time or those people who’ve never worn one. My endocrinologist is a perfect example of someone who doesn’t know Bupkis about TiR, which is pathetic in this day and age. He becomes hyper when he see’s my non-diabetic A1C’s, and despite the data believes I must being having dangerous hypos.
As someone who’s lived with T1D for nearly 6 decades, excellent BG control is mission critical for me. I’m dealing with some diabetic complications that never crossed my mind 20 years ago, a time when I still felt I was impervious to complications.
I’d always had “good” BG control, even 25-30 years ago (A1C’s in the 6-7 range). I realize now those numbers - which were applauded by my doctors of the day - were nowhere near low enough to stave off complications.
For my own well-being, running numbers anywhere > 5.0 mmol/L (90 mg/dl) makes me uncomfortable. I aim to keep my average BG < 5.0 mmol/L (90 mg/dl) with an A1C somewhere between 4.6-5.0.
I typically run ranges far lower than most people here, primarily because being in ketosis, I suffer no loss of cognitive function until I reach 2.5-2.7 mmol/L (45-49mg/dl). My brain is fuelled by ketones.
On the high side, I cringe whenever my BG goes > 7.0mmol/L (126mg/dl), and I have high alert set at 8.0 mmol/L.
I generally run 97-98% TiR with these thresholds, because like all of us life sometimes gets in the way. I reset my G5 this morning, and as so often happens I saw false lows within an hour. Those of you who still use the G5 can relate to this phenomenon.
Typically I’ll have 3 or 4 100% TiR days a week, the others will have lows that I’m not uncomfortable with however the software doesn’t allow me to set lower thresholds that are in line with my comfort zones.

Like you, I’m able to achieve these kind of numbers due to maintaining my metabolism in nutritional ketosis. I also fast like you but not often beyond 24 hours. I did, however, fast for 42 hours recently and enjoyed some outstanding glucose levels.
My day after the fast ended results reminded me that fasting’s effect on BGs persists after the fast. On that day I experienced 100% TIR (65-140) with an average BG of 97 mg/dL and a standard deviation of 13 mg/dL.

The dread G6 session-restart block is here


Maybe not most users with insurance coverage, but to anyone paying out of pocket, or who would like to use a CGM but can’t afford to until prices drop, restarts will always be attractive.


I’m splitting this topic off here since it raises an issue I’ve often considered but have not written about.  I’m thinking about the US versus Canadian health economics models. While I’ve always enjoyed very good access to things like CGM supplies with reasonable out of pocket costs, I’m starting to wonder if people in Canada might be able to finance these non-covered supplies with the huge avoided costs that I must pay.
For example, I pay about $400 USD/month for insurance premiums before I see dollar number one in benefit. I am covered by Medicare Parts A & B as well as a supplement plan that picks up copay amounts. I’m eligible and pay for a pharmacy benefit plan I earned from my former employment.
I also must fund annual deductibles and copays. In addition, none of my insurance coverage extends to alternate providers like naturopaths or any dental work.
I estimate that I pay $900-$1,000 per month for health costs, including insurance premiums. That’s about one dollar out of every four of my annual income.
On the plus side of this equation, I receive all my pump supplies, test strips, and CGM supplies without out of pocket costs. In reality, I’m already paying dearly for this “benefit.”
I suspect that many people in Canada, while they do often pay 100% for things like CGMs, are financially better off than me.
I’m not well educated about the Canadian health access model but I do know that the system varies from province to province.
What do you think of this idea, especially if you live in Canada?",Aug '19
4492,Is health care really more affordable in the US compared to Canada?,Diabetes Advocacy,Diabetes Advocacy,David49,2,"So, I can only speak about the two situations I’ve been in: in Scotland in the 90s on the National Health Service, and in the U.S. on employer-subsidized health insurance. Here’s the breakdown:


When on the NHS, I never paid out of pocket for anything. Period. As a student, my taxes were verging on nothing (I paid less than $100 USD equivalent in income taxes, and the only other taxes I paid were VAT). Interestingly enough, even though I was in a large city with a sizeable population and limited NHS resources, I also never waited for care.


Now, on my solid plan from my university in the U.S., I pay:
a. My monthly premium in addition to what my employer pays (the split is about 25/75 in my “favor”)
b. My copays of $25.00 per regular visit, $50.00 per specialist visit, $400 per hospital visit, $15/25/50 for drugs by tier, and probably some others I haven’t discovered yet.
c. Of course my deductible of only $750 / $1500 (individual/family) and a drug deductible of $250 / $500
d. And after all that, I still get to pay Copay plus 20% Coinsurance on any visit until I meet the “out of pocket maximum” of $17,500 (or something).


I’ve been averaging about 33% of my pre-tax pay per year for my family’s medical expenses. Part of that is we had a very difficult C-section for my son a few years back, and somehow that was not subject to out of pocket maximums. We’ll be paying that bill for the rest of my life, and I’m willing to bet my son will have to pick up the portion of the tab I can’t pay off.

Perhaps you need to be a little more granular in how you arrive at $900-$1000 per month as I believe that number can fluctuate pretty wildly depending on what you cover directly, what might be covered by a 3rd party such as current or previous employer and what your overall medical requirements may be.
I am also on Medicare Part A + Part B with Blue Cross supplemental insurance ($592 per quarter) + Part D ($12.83 per month) and my total costs for insurance is about $335 per month + my insulin + a statin.  Statin copay is about $9 every 90 days and my insulin runs about $60/month (Purchased out of pocket in Canada).  My Dexcom G5 subscription is 100% covered with my plans.  My insurance coverage is all 100% self pay - no employer contribution except where mandatory.
My costs, therefore, if I have this right, run less than 1/2 of yours.  I go through about 300 units of Humalog every 12 days and also figured in the basal Lantus I gave up 7 months ago at 250 units per month.

I can’t comment on Canada, but in Australia with a Seniors Health Care Card:

CGM is not funded at all (Dexcom G5 works out at US$4717 full retail, using sensors & transmitters at Dexcom warrantied intervals) [NB for people under 21 CGM is fully funded ie no out of pocket costs, and there are other cheaper ways of getting it, plus obviously the ability to extend sensors & transmitters]
General prescription price is US$4.40: For insulin your typical script would be for 5 boxes of 5 penfills, i.e. 4500 units (Novorapid, Humalog, Fiasp whatever are all the same price). Some prescriptions for drugs not covered by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme can be more expensive.
Test strips are US$10 for 100
Syringes, needles, pen needles are FREE
Pump consumables: Cartridges are US$6.10/box of 10, infusion sets are US$8.10/box of 10
GP visits are usually free (some GPs may bill, you’re free to go to one who doesn’t)
Public hospital visits are free
Endo visit through a public hospital clinic or attached diabetes service are free
Pumps are not funded

Stack on my $30,000 in student loan debt (from an “affordable” state school), and staggeringly low wages due to entering the job force in 2009 and I’m screwed unless something changes in this country soon.

Your system […] covers everyone and eliminates the desperation that some of us feel here.


Yes and no. The system is great if you are in hospital or a doctor’s office, or somewhere a doctor has sent you, such as a blood lab or MRI clinic. Anything done or dispensed there (with some exceptions) will be paid for by your provincial government. Outside of that, though, you’re on your own. Private insurance, or being on a provincial public plan, is a necessity for some.
Without private insurance, for 35 years my medical costs were all out of pocket – prescriptions (easily $800 a month), pumps and pump supplies, CGM. Now that I have private insurance, and now that my province covers pumps and most of the cost of supplies, I often wonder how I managed to pay those bills. A study published last year 1 found that almost a million Canadians cut back on food, heat or other healthcare expenses because of drug costs. So, not everything is covered for everyone, and costs for individuals can be a burden.",Aug '19

To throw my personal situation into the mix, I’ve spent US$5400 so far this year, excluding premiums (I’m on my wife’s policy). That includes $1500 deductible for our high-deductible PPO plus co-pays with the 80/20 plan.

In general Norway has a cradle to grave social system unlike Canada which is somewhere between the US and Europe. Since I never worked for a company that had a pension plan for its employees I’m on basic Old Age Security which is $1200 a month. The same goes for my wife, an artist who also never had a pension plan. And I get $1200 a month from Norway for the years I worked there. Because of that we are considered low income and receive about $700 a month in guaranteed income assistance (GIS). In addition we pay nothing for our medical insurance (MSP) and medications and get $1000 in dental care every second year and two pairs of glasses every third year, and my wife was just given a $4,200 set of hearing aids she needed.

4511,"Medicare’s quarterly visit requirement, a help or a nuisance?",Diabetes Advocacy,Diabetes Advocacy,Terry4,1,"The US Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandates that beneficiaries who desire that Medicare cover their insulin pump supplies must comply with the agency’s quarterly visit requirement (QVR).
This requirement states that we must visit our doctor every 90 days. If we seek to purchase pump supplies on day 91, the supplier will likely refuse to ship this order.
I see this requirement as a nuisance that neither helps the beneficiaries nor the agency itself. Many people on Medicare report that they’ve adopted tactics to help them accumulate a buffer of supplies just to deal with the vagaries of this system.
They might, for example, push insulin infusion sites beyond the 2-3 day timeframe and possibly subject themselves to site irritation, inflammation, and erratic absorption. This Medicare policy is then doing the exact opposite of what it intends.
The Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology published a report on this issue in March 2019. Among other things, it found these results:

This study highlighted a few issues of the QVR [quaterly visit requirement] policy for Medicare patients to receive the supplies necessary for continued CSII [continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or pump] therapy.
(1) This policy is not evidence-based. Data from the T1D Exchange Clinic Registry showed no correlation between visit frequency and A1c in patients over 65.12 Importantly, respondents in this study were consistently well managed for years before they went on Medicare, mandating a visit frequency violates the principle of individualization of diabetes care espoused by ADA18 and AACE.10
(2) The QVR policy adds an undue administrative and practical burden on patients, providers and suppliers. It also likely increases direct costs by requiring visits that may not be medically necessary because CSII therapy is a well-established evidence-based treatment that is often started prior to Medicare coverage.
(3) More importantly, our data showed that the QVR policy may lead to delays in receiving CSII supplies, which places individuals with type 1 diabetes at risk for harm. Finally, by mandating a face-to-face visit at a fixed frequency, the CMS [Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services] CSII policy indirectly prohibits developing new options for medical care including remote assessment, which might be the only feasible assessment available to patients in remote areas, or patients who might temporarily change their place of residence based on family or seasonal-weather considerations.

I am a well controlled T1D who feels no need to see my diabetes doctor every 90 days. I see this doctor visit frequency as wasting my, my doctor’s, my suppliers, and Medicare’s time and money. It is a nuisance policy originally intended to promote the health of beneficiaries. It has, unfortunately, morphed into a policy with unintended consequences.
If it were left up to me, I would only seek my doctor’s regular counsel about once per year or, if needed, sooner. Our health care system in the US is burdened with the huge weight of the growing diabetes crisis. Why should we waste precious resources without any benefit?

4520,People with diabetes forgoing basic needs in order to survive according to new studies,Diabetes Advocacy,Diabetes Advocacy,MilaStaff,1,"WRITTEN BY: T’ara Smith
According to two studies presented at the American Association of Diabetes Educators 2019 Annual Conference ,  people with diabetes are forgoing basic needs in the face of rising healthcare costs and utilizing alternative methods for procuring necessities for their care. Skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs and deductibles coupled with the increasingly prevalent issue of affordability of supplies and medications like insulin has prompted a number of people with diabetes to partake in underground exchanges of necessary supplies.
Over the course of these studies, which were presented by lead author Michelle Litchman, Ph.D., FNP-BC, an assistant professor at the University of Utah College of Nursing, researchers surveyed 159 adults affected by diabetes, including caregivers and care partners. Findings concluded that nearly half of the individuals who participated cannot afford necessities for their family as a result of the costs of their condition.

The financial distress faced by the diabetes population forces some to go without reliable food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Rationing doses of medication, reusing diabetes tools, and skipping blood sugar tests were also common among those examined in the study. While assistance from pharmaceutical companies is available, only 58 percent of people who apply actually receive it.
Quoting a participant from the study, Litchman said: “‘I had to pay rent, but instead I needed insulin.” Litchman calls this the debt or dead dilemma — patients who have to make decisions between their life-saving medication or basic life necessities. Referencing to another patient, Litchman added: “ For some patients, some days they can only eat rice and ramen, meat is a luxury. How can we ask our patients to eat healthy foods if they can’t even afford it?”
Researchers also documented the existence of an underground exchange system commonly utilized by people with diabetes and their caregivers. Those in need trade, borrow, and purchase medications and supplies to bypass the rising costs of their healthcare. These purchases are made from unauthorized and illegal diabetes suppliers. More than half of study participants admitted to having donated to others in need, while a third of the study population said they had received a donation. The data suggests the system is preventing hospitalization and death while bypassing common delays of healthcare bureaucracy.
The study showed that people living with diabetes were affected whether or not they had health insurance. Those who experience financial distress are nearly seven times more likely to engage in trading and nearly three times more likely to engage in receiving donations.
Listed in the session were the benefits and consequences of underground exchange activity:
Benefits:


Prevented hospitalization and death.  People with diabetes decide to purchase supplies from an unauthorized supplier over going to the ER, where they know their healthcare costs will go up.

Preventing delays in care.  Fewer or no time wasted on waiting to be seen by a professional.

Ability to try before you buy.  People with diabetes can temporarily try a new product without going through their insurance.

Consequences:


Financial burden.  Sharing supplies with another person can force the donator to purchase more supplies sooner than usual. Most wouldn’t share their supplies unless they absolutely could, however, they’re more likely to share their supplies with family members. Those who have an excess of diabetes supplies will donate it to those in need and wait to collect an excess of supplies before donating further.

Potential safety issues.  Some will knowingly take insulin that’s not refrigerated, test using expired test-strips, or even use CGM sensors that don’t work. Places where people with diabetes purchase supplies include eBay, Craigslist, and even going across the border.

Litchman revealed a part of these studies was that most surprised her: the impact of financial distress had on the siblings. “I was surprised about the effect it had on the siblings.

There was resentment about the financial burden of costs of care, as well as the guilt of the parents who had to pay for the treatment,” said Litchman. Feeling a sense of financial burden is the result of feeling guilty that a person with diabetes has a condition that’s financially draining. Other examples shared during the session was a patient stating it would be cheaper to die. Litchman noted the patient wasn’t suicidal; they were just stating a fact about their life.
Is Underground Trading a Worsening Issue?
Litchman says yes, especially among those who are on insulin and those who don’t know how to use or access technology, an issue that also greatly impacts people with Type 2 diabetes. One in four couldn’t use diabetes technology even if they wanted to.
The repercussions of high insulin prices can be deadly — There have been a troubling number of stories lately regarding deaths related to insulin prices. It was recently reported that Josh Wilkerson died after aging out of his stepfather’s insurance plan and switching to a more affordable type of insulin. Just last month, the family of 21-year-old Jesimya David Scherer-Radcliff shared that he died 1 as a result of rationing his insulin. Similarly, 24-year-old Jada Louis passed away in June after a week-long hospital visit to treat DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis), brought on by her skipping insulin doses. In 2017, Alec Smith, Antavia Lee-Worsham, and Justin Lutgen all died after they could no longer afford insulin and began rationing.
When discussing what diabetes educators and care specialists can do address the issue, Litchman said patients need to be asked if they’re engaging in this behavior because professionals need to know how to educate and assess the safety of the supplies they’re using.
“People don’t want to be fraudulent or break the law. People want to be well. We need to recognize this is why they started this anyway,” said Litchman.",Aug '19

4532,New Senate bill would speed up availability of generic insulin in the U.S,Diabetes Advocacy,Diabetes Advocacy,MilaStaff,,"WRITTEN BY: Todd Boudreaux
On July 11, 2019, U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Tina Smith (D-MN) introduced the  Affordable Insulin Approvals Now Act , a bipartisan bill to speed up the approval process of generic insulin products in order to help lower costs of the life-saving drug.
In December 2018, then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., released a statement detailing a handful of new guidances designed to increase competition and bring down prices across the insulin market, slated to take effect in 2020.
Though these guidances were meant to increase competition, they had the unintended consequence of potentially slowing down approval of generic insulins currently in production. According to a press release by Durbin’s office, the FDA’s “new guidance effectively creates an application termination cliff on March 23, 2020 — in which the FDA will automatically reject ‘generic’ insulin products that are in the approval pipeline during that time. As a result, this could delay approval of lower-cost insulin products for American patients.”
This new bill aims to fix this “termination cliff” by requiring the FDA to continue reviewing generic insulin applications after the agency’s currently planned March 2020 cut-off date.
In March 2019, Lilly Diabetes announced that they were releasing an authorized generic version of Humalog 1 — Insulin Lispro — for half the list price of Humalog. Insulin Lispro is now available in pharmacies across the United States, and is viewed as the first of what could be several generic insulins coming to market over the next few years.
“More generic insulin in the market means lower costs for those in need. Our bill encourages competition and free market solutions to the rising cost of this life-saving drug,” said Cramer. The legislation is supported by Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition, the National Diabetes Volunteer Leadership Council, and Children with Diabetes.
This bill comes on the heels of another insulin pricing bill introduced by Senators Smith and Cramer. Just two weeks earlier the pair announced the ‘Emergency Access’ Bill to lower insulin costs. That legislation features the set-up of an emergency insulin assistance program, which would be funded in part by a fee imposed on insulin manufacturers who raise prices more than 10% in a year.
The introduction of these bills is a positive step at a time when insulin pricing is under more scrutiny that ever. It remains to be seen however — if and when these bills are enacted — what the real-world effects will be.
Earlier this week, the Trump administration withdrew their support of the “rebate rule”, a proposal touted for months that would help lower insulin costs for some. If passed, Medicare and Medicaid recipients would have seen rebates added into the upfront or “list price” of insulin, lowering what they pay at the pharmacy counter. These rebates are currently going to Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) who negotiate the prices between insurance companies and drug manufacturers.",Jul '19

In those situations, its a practical matter of survival to focus on what can be done, as opposed to what cannot. However…
Some strategies developed when people tried to escape from the Gulag. I like the gulag example because the world didn’t know that the gulag existed for a long time.  I don’t think most normal people have any idea about the circumstances that surround diabetics or other ‘sick’ people who rely of the healthcare system in the U.S.
So, in the gulag, people sometimes tried to escape in groups of 3. The group was 2 friends who had an alliance, and one guy who they secretly termed “the walking meat.” They had to cross vast territory on foot to reach Finland with no resources whatsoever. The 3rd guy was, unwittingly, the food.
Does anybody recall the Federal hearings this year where they kinda said that diabetics buy insulin, a very expensive drug, but a very predictable cost/supply of money entering the healthcare system to subsidize the rest of the system so that it doesn’t collapse?
They seemed to state, in unusually frankness, that diabetics are the walking meat. Along IgotT1’s strain of thinking, how big of a house of cards is this system? Efforts at reform have always seemed kinda pointless to me, unless they burn the whole system to the ground and start from scratch. Your never gonna reform the Gulag into a functioning state run enterprise.
To lighten the mood, here is a beautiful painting of women from the Soviet collective farms painted in the 60’s…looks reasonable enough, right? I always think of the woman in the middle as the diabetic - the walking meat.

According to what I was taught in high school history, this is exactly what the electoral college system was designed to be.  The occasional veto of the popular vote by the electoral college, or the electoral college followed by the House of Representatives, is not an accidental aberration.  It was planned that way by the Hamiltonian Federalists, who were afraid of putting too much power in the hands of ‘the common people’, the undereducated (in their opinion), the mob.

Especially once the majority figure out they can vote in those who will take from the minority and give to the majority.

I and my small children (then) have been physically attacked by perfect strangers for no other reason than the fact that we look different, and I live in fear.  G-d save the United States!
Politics aside, anyone who is interested in this subject should remember to reread Tocqueville’s Democracy in America.

The pharmaceutical industry has no incentive or advantage to solve this issue and I don’t see that individuals can solve it on their own either without changes in political policies.

Mehta, of the United States District Court in the District of Columbia, ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services exceeded its regulatory authority by seeking to require all drugmakers to include in their television commercials the list price of any drug that costs more than $35 a month. The rule was to take effect this week.

I agree with your analysis. We in the US need to accept that some countries take care of their resident’s health better than we do.

A UK airport’s security team is under scrutiny 1 after taking possession of a woman’s insulin for inspection and failing to return it.
Jayne Knott, from the city of Hull, alleged that on April 10, members of security at Leeds Bradford Airport confiscated her insulin and blood glucose monitor before she boarded her approximately five-hour flight to Cyprus.
The scene was purportedly “chaotic,” and Knott told BBC that she was “patted down and scanned” after it was brought to attention that she was wearing an insulin pump. Security then took her insulin and blood glucose monitor to inspect and swab them, and Knott did not check to see if they had been placed back into her bag. It was not until she had already boarded the flight that she noticed she had not gotten her insulin or BGM from the security team. It is unclear if Knott made a point to push for getting her supplies back before the flight left the airport.
Knott believes she took the appropriate precautions and wore a lanyard to specify her medical condition. She was distraught flying having left behind the medication that she needs to survive, and claimed that she has “always been so careful” to keep her insulin close by.
“I really feel like not flying abroad again because of what’s happened unless the airport security staff do something to change their procedures to allow additional time for us to go through and explain the situation with regards to the equipment that can’t be scanned,” Knott commented.
A spokesperson for Leeds Bradford Airport asserts that procedures are currently under review, as is the event in question: “We would like to apologize to Mrs. Knott for any inconvenience caused and have also been in direct contact with Mrs Knott to try and reunite her with the medical equipment.”
On April 19, Knott tweeted that she was reunited with her insulin and supplies and that she hopes the situation “helps to improve security procedures at airports for diabetics and people with hidden disabilities.”
This instance calls into question airport practices and protocols for people with Type 1, as well as the overarching lack of awareness of the needs of T1Ds in the public sphere. Airport security could be more informed about the ways they impact anyone with chronic illness as the lack of information surrounding T1D must be taken into account.
For those traveling in the UK, specific protocol for hand luggage and contents 1 states that travelers must carry appropriate documentation from a medical professional for medications and equipment. Containers may be opened by security staff and equipment often requires separate screenings.
In the US, the TSA also outlines specific procedures for those with medical conditions 4 going through airport security. Travelers are asked to separate out their diabetes-related medications before entering the checkpoint line. Passengers wearing insulin pumps can go through metal detectors or be screening using imaging technology, but can ask for a pat-down if they’d prefer.

US drug costs have reached unacceptable and unsustainable levels. Evidence shows that “financial toxicity” arising from drug costs and other medical expenses is reducing financial security for many families1 and prompting difficult choices, as patients defer or forgo therapies they cannot afford.2 In stark contrast, comparable countries negotiate drug prices and use drugs more effectively. Recent data suggest that other high-income countries have an average life expectancy approximately 3 to 5 years longer than that of the United States, which ranks last among high-income countries and is losing ground compared with peer nations.3 Although drug prices account for only part of these trends, they nevertheless add to disparities that dominate the trajectories of US health outcomes.
Under the current US system, drug manufacturers estimate what the market will bear for a novel therapy. Then, if there is concern about negative publicity about drug prices, a fraction of the cost may be subtracted, at least while attention persists. Absent competition or negotiation, this fraction is determined by the company’s internal moral compass and the degree of awareness in the biomedical ecosystem, which is often driven by public perception of the specific disease.

4646,House Members Riled Over Insulin Prices,Diabetes Advocacy,Diabetes Advocacy,MilaStaff,7,"by Shannon Firth, Washington Correspondent, MedPage 2
WASHINGTON – Physicians, researchers, diabetes patients, and patient advocates shared strategies for making insulin more affordable during a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee on Tuesday.
“Our insulin supply chain is broken, unfair, and dangerous. Our patients deserve better,” said Alvin Powers, MD, a representative of The Endocrine Society and director of the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center in Nashville.
A few of the recommendations floated by experts and advocates included pressuring drug manufacturers to lower list prices, eliminating rebates for pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and improving so-called patient assistance programs.
Over 7 million people use insulin each day to keep their diabetes under control, said Chairwoman Diana DeGette (D-Colo.). While the medication itself has changed little over the last few decades, prices have doubled since 2012 after tripling in the prior decade, she noted. (It wasn’t clear whether DeGette is aware that more recent synthetic insulin analogues such as lispro and glargine, sold as brand-name products, have taken a considerable slice of the overall market.)
DeGette and Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) are co-chairs of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus who authored a report 1 asserting that “market failures” have pushed prices into the stratosphere.
At the hearing she cited a  JAMA Internal Medicine  study, published in January, that found one in four patients rationed their insulin in the past year because of costs. The study was co-authored by one of the hearing’s witnesses, Kasia Lipska, MD, an endocrinologist and research scientist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.
Lipska told the committee that affordability directly affects medication adherence, and patient outcomes in turn. Those experiencing “cost-related underuse” of their insulin had three times the risk of hyperglycemia.
For those with type 1 diabetes, rationing insulin can lead to life-threatening ketoacidosis, noted Lipska. (In September,  NPR  reported on the ketoacidosis death of Alec Raeshawn Smith, who was rationing his insulin one month after going off his mother’s insurance.)
Using less insulin than necessary can also lead to other “devastating complications” including blindness, end-stage renal disease, and amputations in patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, she added.
As for tackling the high cost of the drug, most if not all of the witnesses advocated for improving transparency.
“We just do not understand the flow of money though the supply chain,” said William Cefalu, MD, chief scientific, medical and mission officer at the American Diabetes Association (ADA).
An ADA working group which analyzed the issue had found little proof that upstream deals ever benefit the patient, he noted.
Committee members and witnesses alike noted that, under the current drug supply chain, everyone from drugmaker to retailer – but not the patient – benefits from higher list prices, because PBMs, wholesalers, and others receive rebates that are a percentage of the drug’s list price.
They stressed the need for drug manufacturers to lower their list prices and for PBM rebates to be eliminated entirely or passed onto consumers at the point of sale.
(Hours after the hearing ended, Cigna and its Express Scripts PBM subsidiary said they would cap monthly out-of-pocket costs at $25 for at least some enrollees. The firms said they were “partnering with insulin manufacturers to lower copayments to $25 at the point of sale.”  STAT News , however, pointed out that employers who contract with Cigna/Express Scripts must agree to the plan, “and not all of them will.”)
Christel Marchand Aprigliano, CEO of the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition, who herself has diabetes, pressed for completely dismantling the current system.
She said she supported the administration’s recent proposal to scrap PBMs’ rebates and instead pass on savings to patients at the pharmacy counter.
Aaron Kowalski, PhD, chief mission officer for JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), also supported the administration’s plan but hoped that a mechanism to pass rebates to consumers could also be expanded to the commercial sector.
Another potential tool for helping patients afford insulin are patient assistance programs, typically offered by drugmakers to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients who qualify. However, Powers called these programs “restrictive” and “difficult to navigate.”
Indeed, Marchand Aprigliano described her struggle to enroll in such a program after her husband was unexpectedly laid off. At the time she and her husband had zero income, but the application required financial records showing past income. She was told it would take 4-6 weeks for the group to make a decision on her application.
“That is unconscionable,” she said.
Committee members stressed that such programs were “Band-aids” rather than long-term solutions and, as Marchand Aprigliano noted, can lead to delays in care.
A final factor related to insulin prices is Americans’ growing reliance on high deductible health plans that require patients to pay the full cost of a drug until they reach their deductible.
Rep. Michael Burgess, MD (R-Texas), asked, “Why do we even charge for insulin? If someone has got a diagnosis of diabetes, why not just treat it? … When someone is sick, don’t you want them to take their medicine? Why would you put a barrier there?”
Burgess pondered aloud why the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services doesn’t simply pay for the insulin, because of the cost savings both for the patient and the healthcare system.
“Whatever we can do to lower the cost of insulin, I think is going to increase adherence,” Cefalu said.
Burgess, again pressing the matter, asked why there should be any cost at all.
When Cefalu said this was really a question for Congress, Burgess said he would ask CMS Administrator Seema Verma “next time I see her.”

I have been working on a 1 year project to reduce the calcium build up in my heart arteries as well as other arteries and redirect the calcium where it belongs to my teeth and bones.  There is a lot of research on this to prevent cardiac events that has been done in Japan, Europe and Canada but little to none in the US.  In the US, we don’t normally try to prevent a cardiac event, we let the event happen and then have the best doctors in the world to fix our broken hearts if we survive the event.  Acting in a pro-active fashion is not profitable and therefore rarely practiced in the US.
I have learned over the past 6 months that taking Vitamin K is totally ineffective unless taken with the proper amount of Vitamin D3 and Vitamin A.  The balance is important and finding vitamin K in various doses in the US is next to impossible.  Additionally, proper Vitamin K is needed, with the greatest concentration being in Vitamin K2, long chain MK7 version.
Within the first 6 months of taking the cocktail I believe is the best for me, I have seen some initial success.  To monitor my success, I have a CT heart scan every 6 months to determine my CAC score.  After a full year, I will evaluate if being proactive with Vitamin K is worth the effort or if it is mostly just hype or if it has other non planned benefits or issues.

She did, however, put in a stent which was uncomfortable for 10 days to help painlessly pass any stone remnants and other smaller stones and continued peeing a little blood.

Not exactly though. Some of these vaccines are creating responses to the covid virus’s spikes (mRNA) vs the whole virus (viral-vectored). So there could be variability in exactly what the immune system is being given as a prompt to attack, even if the end result is that it kills the same virus.

4691,Diabetes + COVID vaccines: what you need to know,COVID-19,COVID-19,MilaStaff,1,"WRITTEN BY: LALA JACKSON
Editor’s Note: We have a simple goal: tap into the power of the global diabetes community to save lives.  Learn more about what you can do as a person with diabetes 1 to keep yourself and others safe from COVID-19 until we’re all safe.
This article was last updated Monday, December 7, 2020.
Following a recent outpouring of positive clinical trial news, COVID-19 vaccines are coming soon. The upcoming vaccine roll-out has left many with questions about timing, safety, and what to expect – particularly those with diabetes or other underlying health concerns.
Here’s what you need to know about the COVID-19 vaccines on the way:
WHAT VACCINES ARE THESE?
In November, Pfizer and BioNTech announced positive results from the conclusion of their COVID vaccine clinical trials, quickly followed by Moderna. Each is in the process of receiving FDA approval in the United States, with emergency approval meetings happening for each in mid-December.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines went through the standard three phases of clinical trials – Phase 1, where it is administered to a small number of people to show initial safety, Phase 2 to hundreds of people split into groups by things like age and background to show how different types of people react to the vaccine, then Phase 3, in which it is given to tens of thousands of people, tested against a placebo. Because of the speed needed for development, both vaccines were approved to go through animal clinical trials at the same time as human Phase 1 clinical trials.
To be approved, the FDA requires the vaccine work in at least half of those who receive it. For both vaccines currently undergoing emergency FDA approval, early analysis from the National Institutes of Health independent data review board (DSMB) saw that 94-95% of those who received the vaccine in the trials became immune to the coronavirus.
Both of these frontrunner vaccines are mRNA vaccines, a type of immunization that does not use a whole virus but instead employs a piece of genetic material to create antibodies against the novel coronavirus. Each vaccine requires two doses, given three to four weeks apart.
Other vaccines – different types of immunizations made by multiple companies – are currently in clinical trials with results expected early (and throughout) 2021. 58 different vaccines are currently going through human clinical trials; in any trial where participants exhibit worrisome symptoms, the trial is paused and cannot proceed until any issues are corrected.
DO COVID VACCINES AND DIABETES MIX WELL?
Some clinical trial participants have reported mild side effects of the vaccines, much like how some people experience injection-site soreness, mild lethargy, a low-grade fever after other vaccines. Important to note – none of the vaccines undergoing approval in the US have any strain of the real coronavirus in them, so it is not possible to get COVID-19 from the vaccines themselves.
These mild reactions some people experience after vaccines are typical and not cause for alarm – they are a result of the immune system going into action as purposely triggered by the vaccine, creating the ability to fight against the actual virus were a person to be exposed to it.
Because of the mild symptoms experienced by some, it is important to stay vigilant about blood sugar levels for the first 24 to 48 hours after receiving the vaccine. The symptoms may impact your BG, so check your levels frequently, stay hydrated, and be familiar with your sick day routine 1. The mild symptoms you may experience after the vaccine are significantly safer and more easily managed than potentially getting the novel coronavirus itself.
As we currently understand, you are not more at risk to catch the novel coronavirus if you have diabetes, but if you do catch the virus, you may be more at risk for more severe complications from COVID-19, particularly if you have been experiencing consistently elevated blood sugar levels.
If you have specific concerns or worries, make sure you speak to a healthcare provider you trust (or keep tuning into Beyond Type 1 coverage of COVID-19 to hear from the healthcare providers we trust).
GREAT, WHEN CAN I GET MINE?
When you will get access to a COVID-19 vaccine depends on where you live, what you do for work, and your risk-level for acquiring or experiencing severe symptoms of COVID-19. People with diabetes are considered to have COVID-related health-risks 1. Many countries across the world will not be getting enough vaccines for their population for at least a couple years. Other countries – like the US and UK – have already invested in large amounts of vaccines, with more coming quickly over the next months and year. The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will be considering emergency approval for each of the initial vaccines in mid-December.
If you live in the US, this NY Times Calculator 8 will provide an idea of your “place in line” to get access to the COVID-19 vaccine. As voted upon by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, healthcare workers and nursing home residents will be prioritized first, with up to 24 million likely receiving their vaccine in December 2020, followed by other essential workers, including first responders and teachers, in early 2021, dependent upon FDA approval.
People who are not essential workers but live with COVID-related health risks – like those over the age of 65 and/or with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity or other immunocompromising conditions – may be able to receive the vaccine in early to late spring. All others – those who are otherwise healthy and children (as clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine in children are just starting) – will likely need to wait until late spring, summer, or into the fall.
In the US, vaccines will be free, with the federal government paying the vaccine developers directly. They will likely be available in many of the places flu shots are typically distributed – drug store and grocery pharmacies, medical offices, and possibly school clinics. The timeline for each of the vaccines is dependent on FDA approvals, followed by funding for distribution and logistics set up in each state.
STILL HAVE CONCERNS?
Individuals have expressed some hesitation to personal vaccination for COVID-19. This is an understandable feeling – vaccines do not typically make it through development and approval this quickly. Particularly for Black, brown, and indigenous people in the United States and across many places in the world, deep-rooted medical racism and exploitative medical experimentation, including with past vaccines like the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, has led to understandable distrust in vaccine administration and the healthcare system at large.
Here’s what we know:


The speed with which the vaccines were developed was unprecedented. However, the clinical trials these vaccines had to go through were strict and the reporting of their safety and efficacy had to be unequivocally proven and replicated. Three phases of clinical trials, including a Phase 3 with tens of thousands of participants, had to prove safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. Phase 3 of the clinical trials were also double-blind, meaning neither the trial participants nor the company that created the vaccine knew if participants were receiving the vaccine or a placebo. Data was reviewed by the National Institutes of Health independent data review board, and final approval for the vaccines must be provided by the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, composed of scientists who have no ties to the companies by which the vaccines were produced.


Black, Native, and Latinx communities have been hit hardest by COVID-19 because of systemic and medical racism, with Black Americans dying from COVID-19 at twice the rate of white Americans. Ensuring equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is vital to work against the deep impact of systemic and medical racism, but this must be coupled with understanding distrust due to violent medical racism throughout the US’s history.


We don’t know for sure what percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity, but we do know that the more people who are immune to carrying or spreading the virus, the better. Those who are willing and able to take the vaccine are helping to protect everyone in their community.


If, after doing research from reputable, science-based sources (we recommend science communicators like Jessica Malty Rivera for easy-to-digest and accurate information), you are still not comfortable taking the vaccine as it becomes available to you, continue to practice safe health measures to protect yourself and others from the novel coronavirus 1. Until the majority of the population is vaccinated, we cannot rely on herd immunity. We must keep those most vulnerable among us safe until we’re all safe, practicing simple actions like wearing a mask and social distancing to do so.


2020 has been hard; at many times, scary and filled with grief. Working toward getting our communities safe and healthy is important for a multitude of reasons, and will take a united effort. Ensuring you have a plan for when you will get vaccinated once you can is vital to keep yourself and those most vulnerable among us safe until we’re all safe.",Dec '20
4692,Diabetes + COVID vaccines: what you need to know,COVID-19,COVID-19,John58Type 1 or LADA,,"I’d like to toss a few concerns out there which have not been publicized. First of all, if your state follows the CDC guidelines, Type 2 diabetes will put you in line ahead of the generally healthy people. Type 1 diabetes will not, you will not have priority for the vaccine, unless you have other conditions. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html 2
Second of all, I have not found any clarification about the age cutoff of 65 for priority. All through the pandemic we were shown statistics indicating a higher risk of hospitalization starting at age 60, not 65.
Thirdly, many states have expanded the list of “essential workers” to include tech workers, bankers, real estate etc. As I understand the vaccine prioritization here in WA (based on their draft policy) a 64 year old Type 1 diabetic will be in line with 29 year old bankers and tech workers (who are working from home), probably late spring 2021.
Does that seem right to anybody?",Dec '20
4693,Diabetes + COVID vaccines: what you need to know,COVID-19,COVID-19,ChrisP,,"It’s odd that it specifically list type 2.
Also “essential workers” it seems like half the country is essential.
A couple months ago we had a lock down in my county. Almost everything was still open.
I was consider an essential worker and I’m a programer. In my case I can work from home but I was technically allowed to go into work being “essential”.
When it comes to vaccines while I want one asap, I hope someone like me isn’t really consider as “essential worker” as hospital workers, paramedics, teachers etc…
It’s going to be tough to get all these vaccines out as fast as possible. The most important thing is to get it in as many people as possible, that will eventually start slowing the spread and make us all safer.
Better to be quick getting people vacated then spend more time figuring out what is more fare/optimal.

Type 2s are clearly at increased risk—at this point, the research doesn’t conclusively suggest T1s have the same risk, so that’s what I’ve been expecting for a while now (and have said elsewhere on this thread). It is entirely appropriate and accurate to classify T1 as “might” be at increased risk. Lots of things people think might qualify them as higher risk are in that category, like asthma, taking immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune disorders, etc, because the data just hasn’t shown those to be conclusively linked to risk. The conditions listed in the highest risk category are the ones with overwhelming evidence. IMO, they should use those two tiers in those orders, since that’s the best evidence-informed practice.",Dec '20
4695,Diabetes + COVID vaccines: what you need to know,COVID-19,COVID-19,John58Type 1 or LADA,,"I am fine with “might be” at risk being behind “significant” risk.
On a personal level, risk mitigation is the overall goal of vaccination and a “might” person could have good reason to want or need to mitigate that risk by getting vaccinated. Not sure about the other 63 year old Type 1’s out there, but I have been hunkered down for 8 months in order to mitigate that risk. On a personal level, and in consultation with my endo, “might be” was enough to hunker down. Now we are told that “might be” is not enough to get priority for the vaccine.
I am not fine with the lack of gradations to the prioritization below age 65. I believe the cutoff age of 65 is arbitrary.
In WA it appears that a 64 year old Type 1 is going to be at equal priority or possibly behind a 29 year old “essential” banker or tech worker. Despite the clear evidence that hospitalization and etc. risk are much greater for any 64 year old. And despite the fact that Type 1 “might” further increase that risk. And despite the fact that many of the “essential” workers are and will continue to be working from home.
I know it’s hard for the powers that be to inject a more gradational prioritization into this but I think they went too far in the opposite direction.",Dec '20

On March 12, the Diabetes Disaster Response Coalition (DDRC) 3 circulated an update to coalition members in response to coronavirus (COVID-19). The DDRC works to provide important information and support in natural disasters and events like this and to serve the needs of those with diabetes in times of crisis. COVID-19 has spread throughout much of the world 2 and many questions remain about it will affect people with diabetes specifically in the months to come, but understanding the guidance from local, state, and national health authorities is an important step towards ensuring you and your family are as prepared as possible.
The DDRC has effectively moved into phase two of its plan of action in response to COVID-19. Phase one involved monitoring briefings from federal agencies and working to understand the direct impact on the lives of those with diabetes. As the situation escalated, the DDRC opted on Monday to put forth a plan of response and initiate phase two.
Immediate actions being taken by the DDRC include:

In some states, people with diabetes can receive emergency prescription refills when a state of emergency has been declared. The DDRC is monitoring and supporting medication access and the situation in states that have declared emergency, including where people can receive emergency refills → updates will be posted at diabetesdisasterresponse.org 5

Updating the ADA’s 1-800-DIABETES hotline with up to date information and sharing resources for access in the face of financial hardship like insulinhelp.org

Communicating with other response organizations and monitoring the supply chain for possible gaps in available diabetes supplies (currently, none expected)

“As the entire world faces one of the worst pandemics of recent times, we have to make sure the diabetes community is educated and prepared for any possible issues,” said Mila Ferrer, Program Manager at Beyond Type 1 and liaison to the DDRC. “The DDRC’s mission is to ensure people living with diabetes have the necessary resources and information before, during, and after any disaster. Although COVID-19 is not a natural disaster, it does impact us all directly and we want to be able to provide the vital information our community needs.”
The DDRC will continue to monitor current situations in declared states of emergency and what the availability of emergency prescription refills looks like. They are also working to understand more how insurance coverage works in situations like this.

Would you consider cutting your food intake down in order to make your insulin last longer?


There have been many tragic stories about people who rationed their insulin. You could minimize the amount of carbs you eat, but you still need basal insulin as well as insulin to cover the rest of your diet.
If you are short of insulin, please consider buying some of the cheaper, no Rx required, old fashioned Regular that is available at Costco, Walmart and other pharmacies. Its action profile is slower than the rapid acting analog insulins you may be used to but you can learn how to use it well.
Please reach out to the resources listed in this post under the Other helpful resources heading. Rationing insulin is not your best tactic.",Mar '20

Insulin is manufactured in a lot of different places all over the world. We are in pretty darn good shaped. Large medical insurers are telling their staff, in town here, that they might expect to need to work from home for 1 - 6 months. The thing about having such a large 3 month supply is that you want to make sure your fridge doesn’t freeze it and that you dont travel without it, or you will end up paying out of pocket. But, I have ordered my full 3 months, as well.
If your ultra worried, you can always go pick up a bottle of R and NPH at Walmart for emergencies. I have syringes that I prob wont use. If the sh!t hits the fan, you can always contact me to send. Its easy to make syringes last a long time. I’ve been using the same 3 ones for, like, 2 years.",Mar '20
4703,The Diabetes Disaster Response Coalition coronavirus response,COVID-19,COVID-19,John_S2,,"While none of us can predict where this will head and/or end up, I would suggest the following:
Look at your current stockpile of supplies and determine how long it will last. If it is a bit thin, try to stockpile some more before anything gets locked down.
Try to identify alternative sources in advance so that you don’t get surprised if your normal/primary source encounters a problem.
If you are traveling, takes extra extras in case you get quarantined, trapped by changes in travel rules, etc.
We all need to be smart and prepared … but I think that advance preparation will go a long way towards allaying your fears.

There’s nothing wrong with stating the perspective that you and your family take with regard to your sense of vulnerability. Your truth is your truth and your sense of it need not be portrayed as the truth;  in other words your sense of the reality of this pandemic can leave room for other perspectives that your old friend has obviously adopted.
I would send a newsy text reply about your life in the last ten years with plenty of questions about what’s been going on in your friend’s world in that interim.
No need to express the offense that you feel. I place this tactic under the general heading of “social grease,” the art of sharing the common things we feel with all humans while leaving the contrast between you unsaid.
Making a sincere commitment to getting together once this health crisis has passed could help your friend to look past your obvious difference in worldview and focus on what you’ve shared in the past. If your polite and kind response is rebuffed or taken badly, that is beyond your power to control.

Around Halloween, I was talking with coworkers and neighbors about how we love Halloween and love answering the door to the hundreds of kids that come through. But this year, lights were off and decorations downplayed because the three people in our house are compromised or work with people who are. Everyone was very supportive and understanding with our thought process.
Now Thanksgiving has reared its ugly head. My daughter and her boyfriend who is our one household we spend time with, has made the decision to go to Mexico last weekend. I of course was very upset because I had to tell her we couldn’t have them over for dinner. I thought maybe they would cancel their trip but no, they went. So unfortunately we will not be having dinner together and won’t be celebrating together. She understands where we are coming from but wow, really? I am hoping they can pull it together for Christmas because we have never not been together for Christmas. Thanksgiving was always the holiday she didn’t come home for due to costs of trying to come home for both holidays while in school and after getting a job in SF and NYC. Last year was the first time she had Thanksgiving dinner with us because they have moved back to San Diego! But here we are so closed but so far away.
If your friends don’t understand how important your health and well being is, you may need to say goodbye to a friendship. But all of my friends and family have been very understanding to our views. Please be safe and do what you feel is safe. I had planned on dinner being outside this year but now that it is just our household, we are back inside. Maybe if they want to come by, set the guidelines out clearly and firmly and if they can meet them, great and if not oh well, maybe next year. So sorry it has come to this.

Our daughter and her family have taken social distancing as seriously as my husband and I, and so I still feel comfortable visiting with them. The only other person who is being vigilant is my mother in law, who just turned 90. The night before her birthday, we decided to make a “suprise” visit to her. We stayed in a hotel, which I cleaned with Lysol several times before feeling “ok”. My husband went and had a surprise socially distanced and mask-wearing visit with his mom. He didn’t even hug her. The next day was our granddaughter’s 7th birthday & since they have been on “lock down” since March, ordering groceries, home-schooling, son in law working from home, we made a surprise visit to her and then headed home. The issue is that we have another daughter, two of our sons, three more grandchildren, and my mother in that same area - none of whom have taken Covid very seriously. Our other children were ok, and understanding - even without me divulging my diabetes. My mother was very upset. We have explained that we are overweight, over 60, and both have high BP and so we are being extremely cautious. We also live in an area (Michigan) which has been very heavily affected.
She and I have struggled with this from the beginning. She is still working as a school bus aide for handicapped preschool children. A very noble job that she loves, and so she refuses to stop working, in spite of the risk. She insists that she cleans the bus, wears her mask, sanitizes her hands - but also acknowledges that the children don’t always keep their masks on, and, that there have been several cases among the bus drivers and the other aides. She still does her own shopping, even though I had been ordering food for her (until I found out she was still going out.) She visits friends and attends a church that does not believe that you need to wear a mask - rather, you should have “faith”.
I acknowledged that I had hurt her by not visiting, and then explained again that we have different mindsets on our approach to staying safe. I apologized for hurting her, and told her that we would just have to agree to disagree. Just as I cannot stop her from working, shopping, going to church and visiting friends, she has to accept my decision NOT to do the same. I didn’t tell her she was wrong (even though I believe she is), I just said we had different mindsets. I wish I could say that it made things better.

This piece has only proposed a hypothesis: ACE inhibitors (angiotensin coveting enzyme) and ARBs (angiotensin receptor blocker) make people who take them more receptive to catching and incubating the coronavirus.
This is a question that needs to be tested but if it’s shown to be true, then that may explain some of the reason why people with diabetes suffer a higher incidence of more extreme consequences of this virus.

They’re not telling everyone to stop taking their medication. People on social media might not understand this, but ACE2 expression does not decrease the minute you stop taking ACE inhibitors, but that might take quite some time. Stopping with ACE inhibitors therefore does not immediately decrease the risk of Covid-19 infection, while the blood pressure could rise much faster. That would make everything worse.
This hypothesis and the ESC Council statement don’t necessarily contradict each other. Two claims can be true at once: 1) ACE inhibitors increase the susceptibility to Covid-19 infection 2) ACE inhibitors might protect against serious lung complications.
Finally they suggest that calcium channel blockers might be a good alternative that doesn’t increase ACE2 expression.

As to actual infection rates - no country in the world has very good statistics about the actual number of folks infected. They are only reporting confirmed cases.

Two claims can be true at once: 1) ACE inhibitors increase the susceptibility to Covid-19 infection 2) ACE inhibitors might protect against serious lung complications.


Right. If I were on an ACEI or ARB, I would probably not stop it. I think it’s best to check with the doc. From what I’ve read of different studies, ACE inhibitors and ARBs result in upregulation of ACE2. I suppose this is a natural consequence of something flooding to block the receptors. On the other hand, the receptors are blocked! So, wouldn’t that be a good (ie preventative) thing? Hence the European study (I guess). Honestly, I don’t know.
I’ve also read that ACE2 can also be increased by ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones a class of diabetic medicines. Just passin along what I’ve read.

If I had fallen asleep for 24 hours though, there wasn’t anyone who could’ve helped me with the inevitable DKA (my longest acting insulin at the time was NPH which was maybe good for 12 hours).

 Christoph:

No, not like the flu. Cytokine storms can occur when your body is trying to fight the virus, so before recovery. Basically, the immune system is going into overdrive and causing lots of damage, if not properly treated. That’s very dangerous.

 Don1942:

vitamins D


Be sure to only take the recommended daily dose of vitamin D.   Vitamin D is a “fat-soluble” vitamin and it is possible to get Vitamin D toxicity.   (Same is true with A, K, and E {and maybe a few Bs}) So either stick to the recommended daily dose or ask a doctor how much you should be getting a day.   Most people will  be reasonable but some out there will think more is better and may start taking too much.",Mar '20
4803,Reminder about emergency supplis,COVID-19,COVID-19,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,1,"This is in pill form, food is usually a whole different ball game. Food sources don’t generally come in super high absorbable or higly convertible sources.
Vitamin D -  A lot of Americans are short on vitamin D. For some reason diabetics are prone to lower levels. It actually commonly comes in 1,000, 2,000 or 5,000 iu doses, (even 10,000) but there are many out there with only 400 iu.
Zinc-  Too much zinc can suppress the immune system if you try to take a “too high” dose daily. So stay within the 30-150mg doses. Most actually recommend under 50 or 100mg daily as a separate pill, that way usually combined with a multiple you won’t go over the recommended dose.
Vitamin A- This is one you have to be the most careful with, it can help with the immune system, but pregnant or possibly to be pregnant women need to be really careful about the dose of this vitamin. And there very definitely is an upper limit for everyone. Beta carotene converts to vitamin A as needed, and you can take a higher dose of beta carotene, but a diabetic isn’t as good at converting it to vitamin A.
It’s really hard to get a toxic level of Natural Vitamin E, but I suppose you could. It is a blood thinner and at high doses if you have issues with it’s blood thinning properties would cause the most problem. I believe very high doses can result in diarrhea, headaches etc. There has been a recent problem connected with synthetic vitamin e and vaping products that have it. Synthetic vitamin e is the cheaper version that is commonly found in your regular store.
Most of the problems with Vitamin K are with it’s synthetic form too. You are the most likely to have an issue with this vitamin if you are on blood thinners because it helps with blood coagulation. Sold doses are usually pretty small.
Vitamin C is almost always in it’s water soluble form and people have taken huge doses of it, Linus Pauling who did a lot of the research on it took very high doses. The most prevalent problem you will have with higher doses is diarrhea. Diarrhea can occur from even low amounts in some people, but most don’t have an issue until over 2,000 mg.",Mar '20

4805,Reminder about emergency supplis,COVID-19,COVID-19,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,1,"@Dave44   I started thinking this through…Everybody buys extra TP and they are hurriedly making more to meet the demand. But then factories shut down to stop the spread of the disease or a worse case scenario they shut down or slow down because of a lack of employees because they are sick etc, even if it’s for a few weeks. So then less toilet paper being made than normal.
So it’s a good thing to buy lots now and ramp up production now, to make up for a shortage in production later. So buy lots of TP now. We don’t want to be without TP.
EDIT:::  I’m making fun of what I consider a very serious situation. But I think we all need a smile off and on.",Mar '20
4806,Reminder about emergency supplis,COVID-19,COVID-19,JaninaWalker,3,"@Marie20 I like your response about the supplements.  At first I was wondering what TP meant and then I figured it out.  When I get TP, I buy the large bundles as who wants to bother buying things often as that is way too much trouble.  It is also cheaper when bought at super stores in the large packs.  That is not hoarding, but being careful to get a good deal if you live in a place where you have a laundry room to store it.
Anyway I believe very highly in supplements and certainly have idolized the writings of Dr Linus Pauling for decades.  I strongly recommend the high dose of vitamin C as it keeps my cholesterol profile more ideal that way.  So, if I do go down to lower the level of vitamin C it for a while the results are seen in the cholesterol profile getting worse until I go back to my usual high dose routine.  So for the last 30 years I have done those experiments.  I explained it to CJ114 and he saw how my cholesterol results improved by about 25% just by going back to higher dose levels.  I showed him that back around early part of the year.
I want to add here a title of a video anyone should watch if people want proof of how vitamin D has been used in a study to show how much it was used in a hospital study and the only people who died were in the control group who did not get any vitamin D, so I say especially see at the 10 minute mark in this very useful video.

4808,COVID-19: What your friends with preexisting conditions need you to know,COVID-19,COVID-19,MilaStaff,4,"WRITTEN BY: LALA JACKSON
Editor’s Note:  The following is a collection of conversations and opinions we’ve heard from the diabetes community, but does not speak for everyone.
The first few months of 2020 presented a global health crisis not seen in almost a century. When the coronavirus first emerged, wild theories abounded. We didn’t know who was most at risk to get severely ill or die. There was a mind-numbing amount of conflicting information – do we wear masks or not? Is this virus airborne or does it live on surfaces? Am I safe to go outside at all?
For those of us living with chronic diseases like diabetes, this was all exponentially more intense. Living with an invisible illness during a pandemic is a uniquely anxiety-inducing and isolating experience. Each of us has our own level of fear about our risk, but much of our ability to protect ourselves was based on pure gut feelings because no one had enough data from which to make informed decisions.
Now, we know a little bit more 2. Living with diabetes itself  does not  appear to increase our risk of contracting coronavirus, but if we  do  get COVID-19 and end up in the hospital, things could go south quickly. It also seems like many people who do end up in the hospital have other underlying heart or lung conditions or are older in age, so we don’t know what percentage of risk is diabetes-specific. For many of us, memories of poor diabetes care in hospital settings is a major risk to consider – COVID-19 may not kill us but a medical professional who doesn’t listen to or know how to take care of our needs might. And it may not even be their fault – in an overly taxed medical system that does not have the resources to take care of the volume of people who are sick right now, people with often-misunderstood chronic illnesses fall to the wayside.
Existing in the world with a disease like diabetes can already be already dangerous. Existing in a world currently going through a pandemic, with conflicting and limited guidance and leadership, broken healthcare systems, a taxed medical supply chain, and the medication that is our lifeline often too expensive to afford? It’s all still scary, and while we know a little bit more, we’re still flying blind and doing the best we can amidst constantly changing circumstances. Here’s some of what your friends with pre-existing conditions want you to know:


This is still really scary; please give me space and time to figure out what decisions are best for me.  Every person living with a pre-existing condition is different. Many of us live with multiple health hurdles we’re juggling, and even within the same disease, we each have to take care of ourselves in different ways. Some of us feel completely safe starting to return to (socially-distanced, while wearing a mask) everyday activities, while some of us feel safer continuing to stay at home. Some of us don’t have a choice — the need to earn a paycheck to support ourselves, our families, or keep our health insurance supersedes our fears. Be kind. Be patient. Don’t assume to know what we need. Ask us how you can support us.

Please stop sending me articles about people with my disease dying from COVID-19.  I’ve either already seen it or I’m purposely ignoring it for mental health reasons. I promise I already know all of the risks someone like me faces, and I am doing everything I can to mitigate them. It is my job to pay attention to the level my health requires, and I promise I’ve already done it.

I reserve the right to change my mind at any time for any reason.  In a time when we are all making decisions on the fly, there are days we’re agreeing to things because the most recent headline we saw seemed positive, or we’re having a strong mental health day. At any moment, for any reason, that may change. New studies about how COVID-19 affects people are published weekly, with studies that then directly conflict following just a week later. We’re not being flaky; we’re trying to keep ourselves alive in a constantly changing landscape.

“Don’t worry, it only kills people who are old or already sick” is still a really horrible thing to hear.  Knowing that there are so many people in the world who care so little about our lives is heavy. For many of us, this is simultaneously compounded by how society views our race, our culture, our social standing, our access to healthcare or a paycheck. We are being told we do not matter from multiple directions, and we are exhausted.

Having a discussion about a COVID-19 vaccine isn’t productive for me.  While there are many companies doing clinical trials, there is no current frontrunner. Once there is, there will be conversations about priority vaccinations. No, I don’t know if I will be able to get one. Don’t ask me about how I feel about vaccinations and what I will do once I get one or if I should get one. There are still many unanswered questions about what will happen after a vaccine becomes available and I’m just trying to stay safe until then.

I still love you. But if I say I can’t visit with you yet, please respect that.  I miss you immensely. I wish I could see you. Right now, I’m having to weigh the very real thought that if we visit together right now, there’s a chance I won’t be around to know you for the rest of your life. I don’t want to have to make that decision. Please don’t ask me to.

Please  stay home while waiting for your COVID-19 test results or if you’re feeling under the weather.  This may not feel like a big deal to you. You may not feel like COVID-19 will impact you too harshly or you probably won’t end up interacting with anyone who is high risk when you go outside. But there’s no way to know who’s path you’ll cross and what impact COVID-19 could have on them or someone they are going home to. Many of us who are at higher risk do not have the option of staying inside and away from you. We have to get groceries for our families, we have to earn a paycheck, we have to see our doctor, and many of us don’t LOOK sick. You won’t know when you cross paths with a high-risk person. Please don’t make those choices potentially deadly for us.

They really want people who are likely to expose themselves to the virus so they can see if the vaccine has efficacy


I’ve heard discussion of this point on a podcast recently. Phase 3 of the virus trial is to administer the vaccine to 10’s of thousands or more people but to also give some people a placebo to create a control group. Then the trial administrators need to wait and see how many of the people who got the real vaccine versus the placebo in order to conclude whether the new vaccine is effective with large numbers of people.
A more direct way to challenge the vaccine effectiveness would be to vaccinate, then deliberately expose the vaccinated person to the virus. This, of course, would never pass an ethics test.
So that means that the trial must wait for the active group and the placebo group to naturally expose themselves to the virus. Conducting the trial in communities whose infection rate is high promises to bring the trial to a conclusive end sooner.
Seems like a weird proposition to me. You don’t want to encourage participants to engage in risky behavior but doing so would help hasten a conclusion that promises a breakthrough for community health.
The college age population, I suspect, will yield results quickly. There’s a hazard that a college student given the placebo might risk more social interaction thinking they have been given the actual vaccination. Tricky business!",Sep '20

Yeah, but it bugs me that they don’t go any farther than that. “Diabetes” is not one undifferentiated thing, so I never know what they’re referring to with this stuff. 9x out of 10 it actually means Type 2, because in the media and popular conception that’s what it refers to and they don’t see any need to specify one or the other. I suspect what really is at stake is associated conditions—cardiovascular, obesity, high BP—rather than the disease (whichever kind) per se. People talk about T1s being “immune compromised,” but I’ve never quite understood that. Yes, it was caused by an auto-immune reaction, but that was an over- reaction, not my immune system laying down on the job. I don’t find myself any more prone to every cold that comes along than anyone else. With a really nasty flu, keeping BG in control can get to be a royal PITA, so that could be a problem if you’re prone to DKA.
I really wish they could be more specific, but this stage I suspect it’s mostly a matter of statistics: of the people reacting most severely or dying, what other factors or conditions does that track with? Age, check. “Diabetes,” check.",Mar '20

Here’s what coronavirus does to the body 1
From blood storms to honeycomb lungs, here’s an organ-by-organ look at how COVID-19 harms humans.





I think this article is helpful.
“what actually happens to your body when it is infected by the coronavirus? The new strain is so genetically similar to SARS that it has inherited the title SARS-CoV-2. So combining early research on the new outbreak with past lessons from SARS and MERS can provide an answer. 1…”
Below is talking about SARS specifically, but the article also discusses how SARS and the COVID-19 are similar.
""…That’s when phase two and the immune system kicks in. Aroused by the presence of a viral invader, our bodies step up to fight the disease by flooding the lungs with immune cells to clear away the damage and repair the lung tissue.
When working properly, this inflammatory process is tightly regulated and confined only to infected areas. But sometimes your immune system goes haywire and those cells kill anything in their way, including your healthy tissue.
“So you get more damage instead of less from the immune response,” Frieman says. Even more debris clogs up the lungs, and pneumonia worsens. (Find out how the novel coronavirus compares to flu, Ebola, and other major outbreaks).
During the third phase, lung damage continues to build—which can result in respiratory failure. Even if death doesn’t occur, some patients survive with permanent lung damage. According to the WHO, SARS punched holes in the lungs, giving them “a honeycomb-like appearance”—and these lesions are present in those afflicted by novel coronavirus, too.""",Mar '20

4847,What about corona virus makes it so much worse for diabetics?,COVID-19,COVID-19,Christoph,3,"Additional data 4 has been released, analyzing the impact of various health conditions in a study of 1,590 patients with COVID-19 from China. After adjusting for age and smoking status, diabetes was one of the things that was associated with a greater risk of infection compared to someone without diabetes. This study is interesting because it is looking at the risk for hospitalization, need for ventilation, and death combined, whereas the other data has solely reflected the rate of death of the disease or age group (but not both combined). The study shows that on average, having one health condition increases the risk by 1.79 times, and two health conditions increases the risk by 2.59 times – all compared to individuals without pre-existing conditions. However, diabetes itself is calculated to increase risk by 1.59 times. This means that compared to someone in your age group who doesn’t have diabetes, you are 1.59 times as likely to develop a case of coronavirus that requires hospitalization or ventilation.
How might you use this data 4? You can look up your age group risk 17 and multiply that risk by 1.59 (if diabetes is your only chronic illness) to assess what your risk might be compared to others in your age group.  Note again – this is the increased risk of being hospitalized or dying if you do get infected with COVID-19; it does not represent share of deaths by pre-existing condition.

I have been thinking about this a lot and I just found an article from the ADA that supported my personal belief.
In general, diabetics are NOT any more likely to get the coronavirus than the general population.   (However, those with diabetic complications, or whose diabetes is poorly controlled, such as cardiovascular disease, may be at higher risk because the diabetic complication could affect your body’s ability to fight off the infection.)
The primary problem is diabetics are at a higher risk of worse outcomes if they DO get it.   Infections can cause make blood sugars hard to manage, it can result in more severe complications or, in Type 1s, can lead to DKA.

I have another friend who just got covid. He was only working onsite 2 days a week, 3 days work from home. He made it 6 months. You might make it 3 months. IDK. I would put away every $ to pay for impending medical crisis so you are prepared for that and can relax a bit.
You need a Dexcom. I have a pulse oximeter and BP cuff set aside. You need an emergency kit that you can take to the hospital set aside.

They might just tell you that you can’t work here. In that case, you might be eligible for Pandemic Relief. That might be $100 a week, or it might be $400 a week, or it might be full unemployment benefit. It depends.
Some employers have stated that Americans with Disabilities Act is not valid during Covid. That’s not true, but it shows that some employers really want to have this fight. It has resulted in American Diabetes Association getting lots of help requests. They are overwhelmed, so I recommend starting early if this situation presents itself. You will have a strong union, so I don’t think there’s much risk here, compared to others. When covid hit, our State unions used the crisis as an opportunity to force pay increases and then went remote. Those unions have extraordinary power.

This will flip flop back and forth, but…
Not to minimize anyone’s concerns or risks, but someone living in an affected urban environment has a heightened risk, and then there is the loss to businesses that directly affect many service workers. The affluent can work from home and have things delivered, but someone still has to prepare and deliver it. The latter are more at risk, and typically have fewer resources in case something happens. Suburban and rural people might seem at less risk, but they might also have fewer medical resources should their community get affected, etc.

4885,Not everyone can work from home: addressing worker safety during COVID-19,COVID-19,COVID-19,MilaStaff,1,"WRITTEN BY: Dana Howe and Frida Velcani
 Editor’s Note: This article was a collaboration between Beyond Type 1 and diaTribe. Click  here for more resources from diaTribe on COVID-19.
In May, a testing program in San Francisco’s Mission District screened almost 3,000 people living and working in a 16-square-block area for active coronavirus infection. None of these people had been tested before, and some had symptoms but most did not. Two percent overall, including those who work and live in the neighborhood, tested positive. When the data was broken down between neighborhood residents and neighborhood workers, an underlying issue became clear: just 1.4% of the residents tested positive, while 6% of the workers tested positive.
For many people, minimizing their risk of COVID-19 infection is directly at odds with their need to keep earning wages and maintaining health insurance coverage. Staying home is a privilege – and isn’t an option – for so many people, including many affected by diabetes.
The JDRF – Beyond Type 1 Alliance released coronavirus recommendations for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes to try to keep our community as safe as possible. As restrictions shift and people return to work, our experts recommend to “make work as safe as possible.” But what does that really mean? And how possible is it, really? Breaking it down further, people with diabetes are advised to:

Work from home as much as you can
Modify work procedures to keep six feet (or two meters) distance from other people
Adjust your schedule to avoid encountering lots of people at busy times
Advocate for accommodations (like flexible work options) for high-risk individuals

While these recommendations are important reminders for those lucky enough to need only a nudge to change their individual behavior, they are limited. Workplaces carry some responsibility for establishing policies and procedures to protect their employees, but not every workplace can adapt to the circumstances of the pandemic. For people with diabetes in many essential lines of work – people who have been working throughout the pandemic such as grocery store clerks, nurses, construction workers, or delivery drivers – there is much less ability to stay safe at work. And we know that people with diabetes are at increased riskfor severe infection and complications from COVID-19.
In San Francisco’s Mission District, popular occupations among the workers who were tested included jobs in the food and beverage industry or in trade industries like construction. Of those who tested positive for the virus, 90% indicated that they could not work from home, and 89% earned less than $50,000 per year (despite San Francisco being one of the most expensive cities in the US). The lack of affordable housing is another growing problem in San Francisco that disproportionately affects low-wage workers. The “choice” to work from home or lose a salary is not a choice at all.
In a neighborhood as lively and culturally-diverse as the Mission District, social distancing has certainly been a difficult adjustment. The Mission District is home to a wide variety of restaurants, bars, and shops, with working-class residents making up most of the employees at these essential businesses. These businesses have remained open during the pandemic to keep the community alive and connected, and to retain a source of income and avoid permanently closing down.
“Staying at home is a privilege. Social distancing is a privilege,” wrote Charles M. Blow in The New York Times. “The people who can’t must make terrible choices: stay home and risk starvation or go to work and risk contagion.”
Everyone with diabetes in the United States has experienced the added weight of what “employment” means. A job is not just a job – a job is earned wages that are going directly to the cost of medication, appointment copays, or the purchase of a health insurance plan. A job is the ticket to employer-sponsored health insurance to make the basic necessities possible. Without insurance, the cost of diabetes in the United States can be financially overwhelming. Patient assistance programs exist to help with the cost of supplies, but there are gaps and hurdles (such as extreme cost or the life-threatening health effects of not being able to access an essential drug like insulin). People who are undocumented are most affected by this crisis because they have limited access to employer-based health insurance and are not eligible for federal stimulus money.
As we’ve seen throughout issues of health and healthcare disparities, coronavirus rates also play out along racial lines: 95% of those who tested positive in the Mission District (workers and residents) were Latinx, even though this group made up only 44% of the total population tested. A report from the Economic Policy Institute confirms that Black and Hispanic workers are much less likely to be able to work from home. What happens to those facing multiple challenges of exposure and risk, particularly while also trying to manage a chronic health condition like diabetes?
For CBS news in mid-June, Lina Washington shared the heartbreaking story of her father Robert Washington’s death from COVID-19. Robert was a 68-year-old Arizona resident with diabetes, employed at a casino where customers were not required to wear face masks. He returned to work in mid-May and died less than a month later from COVID-19.
“My dad called me on May 16 fearing for his safety,” Lina tweeted. “He said no one was social distancing and few wore masks.” But, as the CBS article explains, Robert needed health benefits and a paycheck to cover the cost of insulin, rent, and life insurance. Not going to work was not an option, but the lack of protective measures at his place of work cost him his life.
For people with diabetes, consistent and affordable access to medication, technology, and care is imperative. This access falls along racial lines, with Black, Latinx and Indigenous communities experiencing crises of unemployment and COVID-19 diagnoses at disproportionately high rates due to systemic racism. Until we can keep each of us safe, none of us is safe. If you live with diabetes and are not able to work safely, know your rights. If you are able to work safely, lend your voice to Congress. Let them know that we need to protect workers with diabetes.",Aug '20

With multiple strikes already against me (65+, diabetes, kidney problems), I’m concerned I wouldn’t stand much of a chance to get one.
Would an oxygen generating machine for home use help out?  There are machines called oxygen concentrators that work not by connecting to a tank of oxygen, but rather work by sucking in the surrounding air, compressing it, and extracting nitrogen and other impurities.  This provides an oxygen-rich supply of air for the user.
With one of the major symptoms of this virus being difficulty in breathing, it seems that this should help.  What am I missing here?  Note - I think a Dr. Rx is required to get one of these.",Mar '20
4889,Is this a dumb idea?,COVID-19,COVID-19,BoerenkoolType 1 or LADA,3,"No, this won’t work. The main purpose of ventilators is not to provide an oxygen-rich supply of air. They could do that with a simple nasal cannula, no need for an expensive ventilator. The purpose of ventilators is to assist your breathing. These ventilators pump air into the lungs under a pressure carefully adjusted to the patient’s needs, to ensure that the air supplied is also inhaled by the patient. No home-made device can do that. You would probably severely damage your lungs. Even ventilators can take a serious toll on patient’s lungs.",Mar '20

I was running through the same idea of other possibilities when they first started talking about shortages in ventilators and I wonder if why a CPAP machine couldn’t at least help things.   (I am not the world’s expert on things mechanical) but the concept seemed similar.   A week or so ago I read that the FDA stated:
“Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), auto-CPAP, and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP or BPAP) machines typically used for treatment of sleep apnea (either in the home or facility setting) may be used to support patients with respiratory insufficiency provided appropriate monitoring (as available) and patient condition.”
So I wasn’t too far off the mark…
NOTE: If anyone has such devices, I would ask your prescribing doctor about this.  DO NOT DO ANYTHING ON YOUR OWN.
With regards to your question, I know what you mean.  I’m not sure how it would improve things.  I don’t think it would necessarily improve things unless you were sick and then I think it would only be an improvement in that more purified air would be easier to breath and reduce stress on lungs.  ??? (That is pure speculation on my part).
For that matter, i wonder if putting “milder” cases in oxygen tents would help things too???   Take the stress of the lungs early on so that maybe they won’t get as bad???   (Again, pure speculation on my part).",Mar '20

I think the best course of action for those of us in high-risk groups is to stay home. Self-isolate, even.
I see a lot of people using the terms social distancing, self-isolate, and quarantine interchangeably, but they’re not the same. Self-isolation means you have NO contact with the outside world, no walks or grocery runs. You get people to deliver anything you need and drop it at the door so you have no contact with them. The only difference between self-isolation and quarantine is that the latter actually have symptoms or confirmation of COVID-19 while the former are doing it as a precaution.

So we have about 3 more weeks worth now.
The one really bad thing in our area is we don’t have grocery delivery and we don’t have very many food restaurants that deliver in our area either. And they might be all closed. (And probably don’t have vegan food anyway)
Any walks or beach trips can be done in our area without getting near anyone else. You just walk on the other side of the street if you do end up seeing someone, and more people are walking now. But I am in a very small community area with lots of areas to walk or hike. And you can find a beach with no one on it or at least down the beach a ways.

Regarding your idea of an oxygen concentrator:  My suspicion is that would be adequate if you had a mild case of COVID-19 where your blood oxygen levels were mildly depressed. That would likely be roughly equivalent, I suspect, to a “normal” oxygen-supplied cannula that they might use if you were NOT in the ICU and were only experiencing mildly labored breathing. To the best of my knowledge, there is not a shortage of either oxygen or cannulae in hospitals.
As I understand it, a ventilator, as others have pointed out, is a far different beast.
For starters, they intubate you … and then the machine basically breathes for you, coughs for you, allows administration of drugs directly into the lungs, etc. It sounds unpleasant because they normally sedate you, you can’t talk, etc.
Hopefully the likes of GM, Ford, Tesla, and Dyspn can rush FUNCTIONAL and SAFE devices into production in time to meet the increasing need for ventilators.

If someone is conscious and breathing, delivering oxygen will help . But, if they stop breathing, you have to force the O2 to physically move O2 into the air passageways in the lungs because their chest cavity isn’t drawing air in and forcing it out.

Should everyone stay at home then or what do you suggest?


I think that the source of most people’s frustration is summarized in this one graphic:
image1200×1044 36.5 KB
As of April 1 both the US and the EU had about 30,000 new cases of Covid-19 per day (with comparable populations). By July 1 the EU was down to 4,000 new cases per day. And we were at 40,000. Two weeks later, we are at 60,000 cases per day and still rising.
It is impossible for me to look at that and NOT conclude that we collectivity opened up too quickly in our rush to “get back to normal”.  The EU is getting back to normal. We are not!
The science is pretty clear: in the absence of a widespread vaccine and effective treatment, the only thing that will turn this around is social distancing, conscientious mask wearing, and good hygiene.
If we can’t all begin to work together, we will soon be at 100,000 new cases per day.
We DON’T all have to stay home (unless, of course, we test positive) but we DO need to act in a scientifically smart manner when we are out in the real world.
That’s one T1D View …

There are wonderful case studies worldwide on countries that are handling this pandemic much better. In fact, I lived for almost 9 years in one of them.
The issue is about this new hospital requirement, which seems suspect. There is also some wrong info in this thread.
The Federal government just reversed the requirement they were going to lay on international students. They can reverse course if the pressure is put on them. Also, Congress comes back next week. The lowest bar is to simply reach out to your representatives local, state, and Federal
Also, please don’t assume that I’m out. I’m not. I’ve limited my outings to errands, walking, and necessary medical appointments. Pandemics don’t disappear overnight or even in months. Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn’t know history or science very well.
From the perspective of getting as much info as we can and for that info, most importantly, to be transparent, this hospitalization data shouldn’t be circumventing the CDC and going to the White House only.

Their volunteers comb the state news releases on a daily basis to report positive new cases, number of negative tests, hospitalizations, and, as best they can, ICU census (not all states report that …). At this point, 48 of 50 states, the District if Columbia, and the territories publicly release hospitalization numbers. (The two states that don’t release hospitalizations are Kansas and Hawaii). So, while it is odd, if not suspicious, that hospitalization data is being sent directly to the White House instead of to the CDC, at this point, at least, the Covid Tracking Project is still a good, independent source of hospitalization data. Of course, their data is no better than the information that they receive from the states on testing and hospitalizations.",Jul '20

I suspect that by Northern California you likely mean the Bay Area. I spend about half my time in the Bay Area and about half in Santa Fe, NM. I try to keep tabs on both areas. As a result every few days, I download The NY Times County-by-County data from their github site. While the daily case load in the Bay Area has gone up significantly over the past 4 weeks, the increases have not been nearly as dramatic as they have been in Southern California. Last time I looked, based on 7-day moving average of new cases per 100,000 residents, the WORST county in the Bay Area was doing better than the BEST county in SoCal. On average, the daily per capita new cases in the Bay Area are 2-5 times lower than they are in LA and surrounding counties.

4935,Anyone yet have COVID experiences w Diabetes?,COVID-19,COVID-19,meeeType 1 or LADA,1,"I had it, double viral pneumonia. I have no doubt. I have never had any pneumonia in my entire life in spite of having chronic bronchitis as a child. There is no way I suddenly got double viral pneumonia in the middle of all of this after being exposed by my students, several were ill, one in hospital for a day with pneumonia also and same symptoms of terrible back pain as me.  He had a positive test when he was in the hospital I don’t know if he’s done an antibody test at the end of the semester he had not done it yet.
I was very ill but managed it mostly at home. Bg was constantly crashing most of the time, The doctor at the field hospital where I had my first chest x-ray told me to keep my blood sugar as low as possible so that is what I did. Most of the time though it was more trying to stop it from crashing I was drinking several juice packs a day. I think finally now almost 3 to 4 months later my blood sugar has gotten more back into its regular pattern with spikes and things. I am still having lung symptoms coughing congestion using my inhaler is a bit last now. I have been in physical therapy for three weeks for my back and it’s finally starting to improve which is really a miracle because I was in terrible pain every day practically for about three months. I still get the bad pain sometimes and then I get scared it’s gonna start all over again but it usually resolves more quickly in the exercises and massage are really helping.
I still have pretty bad exhaustion and other symptoms too. As far as my tests  go  my first test at the field hospital I was negative that one I believe was not done properly. Also it was already in my lungs then so that could’ve affected the test or just could’ve been false negative. Four weeks later when I did not seem to be recovering and had more pain and breathing trouble, I was worried about pe as well, still coughing, pain and still had a low-grade fever at night I went to the ER and was seen at the regular ER that time. They tested me for everything known to man practically which was all negative again. By that point I think I had already cleared the virus most likely. I had sinus tachycardia then and high blood pressure they treated me for that.
It is only now that I am finally starting to feel a little bit better. Among my symptoms during the pneumonia were  I felt like I had a tight band around my entire chest could not breathe and severe pain in my back as well as numerous other things. I only had a low-grade fever through most of it the highest it went was 100.2 I think. My doctor said she had several patients who also had the same symptoms with only a low-grade fever. I still have a low-grade fever at night though which nobody can figure out from 99 to 100 which seems to last for like two or three hours.
I had one antibody test done by my Endo which was negative however he did not do the test that I asked him to do so my doctor gave me a prescription should do another one which tests IGg and Igm.
I have not managed to do it yet because my father has been in the hospital with various issues at the emergency room and I also sprained my ankle badly last week and was back at the ER myself not being able to walk for a week.  I’m finally walking now but still having pain in my ankle and my leg which is swollen too. so now I have to go to a doctor for that too.
I was reading about the antibody test and what I read so far says  a lot of them are not reliable And I also read that not everybody develops antibodies when they have Covid and some people develop them but they don’t keep them for long. I did not test for antibodies probably until like three months in I think so it could be that I had them and they’re gone or could be that I just did not develop them. For whatever reason.
I also read that some people do not develop antibodies but they do develop T cell immunity. That would maybe explain why my blood sugar was crashing so badly when I was fighting off the virus. My T cells were too busy attacking Covid and stopped attacking my beta cells as much. We know that the attack on data cells and type one diabetes is an ongoing process so your body is still trying to produce beta cells which are continually attacked. Another thing that showed up in my blood work was low neutrophils and low white blood count. I still have a low white blood count and now a low red blood count too.
I had my Endo test me for Epstein Barr virus as well because when I was diagnosed with type one in DKA I had had a reactivation of that. I found that out when I was in Dr. Faustman’s  research study and donated blood. I did not want to go back the following year I told them I was too tired and they asked me to get tested for EBV which I did and it showed a reactivation.
My test now showed a reactivation of EBV again during the Covid virus. I read an article of a study done in China I think were a lot of Covid patients also had an EBV reactivation.
At this point my doctor asked me if I want to go to an infectious disease specialist. I said I’m going to hold off on that until I get another antibody test. And then obviously all of this other stuff happened so I’m just trying to deal with getting my back better and my ankle and everything going on with my family.
I do believe I had Covid and I am happy that I survived it obviously. But nobody seems to know if you’re going to be protected from getting it again so I’m still being very cautious obviously. I found out we are going to be teaching online in the fall again and I’m very relieved although it will mean a lot more work. Everybody should be wearing a mask, goggles and gloves that is what I do when I go to my physical therapy appointments. I am not gonna take any chances that I could get this again.
During  the entire period when they said I was still in danger to become severe I will tell you what I did:
I started taking Zithromax as soon as I had the back pain because I suspected I had pneumonia. I always have that at home because that is the antibiotic I tolerate best for my stomach I believe that helped  stop the severe inflammatory reaction.
I did some breathing exercises which I read about and found a video of a doctor in England I posted here. Those however just hurt my back too much and I stopped doing them at some point but I did feel they were helping clear my lungs out. It was a horrible feeling just don’t know how to describe it it just feels like you can’t breathe properly you have a pressure on your lungs in your that whole area of your body.
I went for two walks once when I had one of the blood sugar spikes because someone told me her mother survived it in March in California and that her doctor had told her to go for walks every day. Her mother was in her 80s. towards the end her mother did have to go into the hospital, she was given Zithromax and hydroxy and she survived. She believes the walks helped her. I feel the walks made me worse so because I  started to feel worse after the walk I took when I had high blood sugar. Although it did help lower my blood sugar.
Last October I had a second DVT and I had been put on Eliquis for the rest of my life now or a blood thinner anyway I may be switching back to warfarin at some point. I believe being on Eliquis also helped save me because we know now that Covid  seems to attack the vascular system and cause blood clots also attacking red blood cells.
I also took high doses of vitamin C during the pneumonia probably about 1000 to 2000 mg. I believe that helped clear my lungs out as well in addition to everything else.
It has  been a long recovery I was pretty ill and it was very very stressful. I was monitoring my pulse ox constantly the whole time having video conferences with my doctor and just not knowing if I was going to end up in the hospital and dying because nobody knows who’s going to get the really severe reactions to it.
I still do not feel well after all of this and I don’t know if that’s still from Covid or partly from having the reactivation of EBV as well or the combination.
With my blood sugar it was really just an afterthought I except that I did take risks trying to keep it low- hi basals when it looked like it was going to spike,  because the doctor had warned me to not let your blood sugar go high and I always prefer to be lower even though I hate bad lows obviously as we all do. I only had one or two spikes during the pneumonia, one was caused by forgetting to put my pump back on after I showered the other one was unexplained but mostly it was crashing unbelievably, and I just kind of rode with it drinking the juice and eating- whatever I needed to do. I did it but it was really an afterthought to worrying about am I going to be dying from this and not being able to breathe etc.  I was really starting to think this was going to cure me from type one but no such luck.",Jul '20

It’s not invincible at all and still has problems (changes in insulin sensitivity, dealing with food, insertion sets gone wrong etc) but broadly I’m thankful that I found it and got on it.

I have been through a lot these past few years but this may be the worst even though I was prolly sicker at dka. I thought my back pain was never going to get better. Everything going on with covid made getting treatment for covid and anything else extremely difficult at first, things are a bit better now. Most docs are still doing mostly video calls here.
I have ts slim x2 but I am still using G5 so I have not tried it yet. I will try it but I have very off numbers frequently with dexcom so I am not sure if it will be safe or good for me and I just prefer to control my insulin myself. I will have to see how it goes. That is great it works well for you!
It was weird because I knew diabetes put me at higher risk as well as asthma but although of course I was doing everything I could to manage the crazy bg, and it was exhausting, it was secondary to my lungs, pulse ox and breathing, bp etc. And the terrible pain. I was so scared I would end up back at the er and had no clue what treatment I would receive since I was given no treatment at all except inhalers at home. TG I had z pack and also had prednisone. My doc told me not to take the pred pills because they thought it was bad for covid then, but now they are using dexamethasone in the  worse and severe cases so it may have helped.
I think if I had been wearing a mask, gloves, and goggles whenever out and only going out for necessary things and had cancelled the last week of classes before we went online I might have not gotten covid. I wear a mask, gloves and goggles to pt / doc now, basically the only places I go so far since and I take a shower and wash my clothes when I come home etc.
Everything that comes in the house gets steamed and sanitized/ washed. I do go for walks, pre ankle, and I don’t wear a mask for that now, but I go at times when few people are around and I just cross the street if someone comes along. I will keep dong this until I get a vaccine and it is really controlled. My family as well although I have to watch them to make sure they follow our protocol.
It is hard to wear a mask when you have asthma etc. piece of cake if you don’t and it is necessary to prevent transmissions, protect yourself and to shut covid down. In addition to social distancing and avoiding gatherings etc. Eye protection is needed as well. I recommend  disposable gloves removed properly and wash hands as well after.
I forgot to mention that my first symptoms seem to have been severe diarrhea for a day with severe headache which I thought was a migraine. The gastro symptoms, aches and headaches continued when the respiratory symptoms started which was when the fever started consistently although I think I had a low fever that first day too.",Jul '20

4950,Type 1 And Covid (New Studies),COVID-19,COVID-19,Marie20Type 1 or LADA,1,"Thanks @JamesIgoe it’s always nice to get any tidbits of information with regards to type 1 and Covid.
I have been reading several short articles that they are pretty sure it has more to do with your actual control over blood sugars. And if you have more than one risk factor, it’s more of a problem. . A real prevalent risk factor is age and obesity. More concerning was it seems to be leaving more widespread damage to the heart even when you’ve completely recovered.
Thanks @Paytone  I’m happy to see type 1 moved so far down the list. It does seem to be that if we get sick our BG’s go up and that becomes the danger with trying to control that and not ending up with DKA etc. And we all worry about how our immune systems will end up reacting.",Jul '20
4951,Type 1 And Covid (New Studies),COVID-19,COVID-19,cardamom,,"I would suspect, given that COVID is a vascular disease, in both cases of T1 and T2, diabetes is functioning as a proxy for vascular health. T2 is more consistently associated with vascular health problems, so makes sense there’s a more robust risk factor there, whereas T1 increases risk of vascular damage as a complication, but it’s highly variable as to the extent of that damage among T1s. I would bet that while A1c/control is a predictor within T1, extent of microvascular and macrovascular complications or poor health might be an even stronger one. However, many diabetics do not realize they are experiencing microvascular damage in early states, so may be easier to use A1c/control again as a proxy for that.
As a T1D with (at this point well managed) proliferative retinopathy, I consider myself high risk, even though my current A1c is good. I think any of us with any history of vascular complications probably should, but that’s just based on my own best guess.",Jul '20

Covid-19 is an RNA virus.
One statement that caught my eye in the RNA virus section was this.

Similar to other viruses, we found an enhancement of glucose uptake and the virus was dependent on both extracellular glucose and glutamine for optimal viral replication (39). However, the amplification of glucose uptake was detectable as fast as 1.5 h upon infection, which ruled out a transcriptional control of this process.

It seems the first order of business for some RNA viruses and perhaps Covid-19 is to increase blood sugar levels to benefit its ability to reproduce. If glucose uptake was amplified within 1.5 hours of infection, it suggests how important elevated systemic blood glucose is to the virus.
I can only hope that one of the enduring lessons of this era in hospital care will be for hospital care providers to place much more emphasis on optimal blood sugar management.

While I can understand linking those events because they occurred in close proximity for your daughter, when these things are looked at over many many children, there is no evidence whatsoever for vaccines causing T1, so it is likely a coincidence that happens to stand out to you. I would not be concerned about vaccines and if anything would be sure to get them given the small amount of evidence they may if anything be protective since they prevent potentially risky infections. Also many of us with T1 have siblings who had all sorts of infections etc and didn’t develop diabetes—if there’s no other family history of it, the genetic factor may not be that strong for your other kids, it’s hard to say.

I understand that, but as a scientist, I would say it is more robust than it sounds, because there have been many many studies on vaccines, and they are so commonly given that if they were a major factor, you’d almost certainly see clear patterns in T1 diagnosis timing linked to vaccines, which you don’t over the population (the majority of diagnoses happen many years later than most vaccines). So in this case it’s not that there’s no evidence because people haven’t studied it (which would be not very reassuring), but because many scientists without any ties to pharma have looked at these issues and repeatedly not found any links, except that vaccines may lower risk of T1 by preventing infections.",Jun '20

From the second link (population study):
“Adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity and geographical region, people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes had 3.50 (3∙15-3∙89) and 2.03 (1∙97-2∙09) times the odds respectively of dying in hospital with COVID-19 compared to those without diabetes, attenuated to 2.86 and 1.81 respectively when also adjusted for previous hospital admissions with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or heart failure.”
From the first link (cohort study):
“The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of HbA1c >86 mmol/mol compared to HbA1c 48-53 mmol/mol was 2.19 (95% CI 1·46-3·29) for Type 1 and 1.62 (95% CI 1·48-1·79) for Type 2 diabetes. The relationship between BMI and COVID-19 mortality was Ushaped; HRs for BMI >40 kg/m2 compared to 25-29.9 kg/m2 were 2.15 (95% 1·37-3·36) and 1.46 (95% CI 1·50-1·79) for Type 1 and Type 2 respectively.”
Here is a link to convert the A1c values to the % we generally see.
http://www.ngsp.org/convert1.asp
It appears that people with Type 1 diabetes are at higher risk of death than people with type 2 diabetes, and that people with an A1c above 10%  or a very high BMI are at the highest risk.
Thank you for posting Marie20, I’ve been wanting to see data on the risk levels of Type 1 vs Type 2.
Edit: However, it’s worth noting that the number of deaths in ages <50 (<40 and 40-50 groups) for people with Type 1 diabetes were so few that they were not reported in the table the authors provided. The Type 2 diabetes cohort had overall fewer people (n) in the <40 age group, but still reported enough deaths that the counts could be listed in the table (23 deaths of 67,800).
I’m not sure how those values factored into the age adjustments. Of course, I’m not a researcher, but given this discrepancy, it seems like it’d be more helpful to report hazard ratio by age. The population study appears to have addressed this more and posted this chart:

We spoke to Sunetra Gupta, Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology at the University of Oxford and head of the team that released a study in March which speculated that as much as 50% of the population may already have been infected and the true Infection Fatality Rate could be as low as 0.1%.
In her first major interview since the Oxford study was published, she goes further by arguing that Covid-19 has already passed through the population and is now on its way out. She said:
On antibodies:
• Many of the antibody tests are “extremely unreliable”
• They do not indicate the true level of exposure or level of immunity
• “Different countries have had different lockdown policies, and yet what we’ve observed is almost a uniform pattern of behaviour”
On IFR:
• “Infection Fatality Rate is less than 1 in 1000 and probably closer to 1 in 10,000.”
• That would be somewhere between 0.1% and 0.01%
On lockdown policy:
• Referring to the Imperial model: “Should we act on a possible worst case scenario, given the costs of lockdown? It seems to me that given that the costs of lockdown are mounting that case is becoming more and more fragile”
• Recommends “a more rapid exit from lockdown based more on certain heuristics, like who is dying and what is happening to the death rates”
Professor Sunetra Gupta: the epidemic is on its way out
On the UK Government response:
• “We might have done better by doing nothing at all, or at least by doing something different, which would have been to pay attention to protecting the vulnerable”
On the R rate:
• It is “principally dependent on how many people are immune” and we don’t have that information.
• Deaths are the only reliable measure.
On New York:
• “When you have pockets of vulnerable people it might rip through those pockets in a way that it wouldn’t if the vulnerable people were more scattered within the general population.”
On social distancing:
• “Remaining in a state of lockdown is extremely dangerous”
• “We used to live in a state approximating lockdown 100 years ago, and that was what created the conditions for the Spanish Flu to come in and kill 50m people.”
On next steps:
•  “It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population”
• It is a “strong possibility” that if we return to full normal tomorrow — pubs, nightclubs, festivals — we would be fine.
On the politics of Covid:
• “There is a sort of libertarian argument for the release of lockdown, and I think it is unfortunate that those of us who feel we should think differently about lockdown""
• “The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.”",May '20

Also, I expect to see more deaths as the country opens up, don’t you? I mean, more deaths caused by crowds.

5002,COVID-19: Straight Answers from Top Epidemiologist Who Predicted the Pandemic,COVID-19,COVID-19,Jim_in_CalgaryType 1 or LADA,6,"from interview conducted on May 29, 2020. Published on June 6, 2020
Dr. Osterholm is arguably one of the most dependable, non-political sources for straight answers on what COVID-19 means to us and our world in the immediate future. In his 2017 book,  Deadliest Enemy , he correctly foretells a global pandemic and offers the best strategy for fighting it now and avoiding it in the future.
Here are the highlights of our conversation. But if you really want to understand this disease, read the whole interview.  This disease may be the biggest event of our lifetimes.

3 months ago, COVID-19 was not even in the top 75 causes of death in this country. Much of the last month, it was the #1 cause of death in this country. This is more remarkable than the 1918 Flu pandemic.
There is no scientific indication Covid-19 will disappear of its own accord.

If you’re under age 55, obesity is the #1 risk factor . So, eating the right diet, getting physical activity, and managing stress are some of the most important things you can do to protect yourself from the disease.
Wearing a cloth mask does not protect you much if you’re in close contact with someone who is COVID-19 contagious. It may give you 20 minutes, instead of 10, to avoid contracting the disease.
We can expect COVID-19 to infect 60% – 70% of Americans. That’s around 200 million Americans.
We can expect between 800,000 and 1.6 million Americans to die in the next 18 months if we don’t have a successful vaccine.
